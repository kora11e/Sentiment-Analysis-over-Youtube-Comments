@Christus.Invictus,"Kim seems to be missing the main point on modern feminism and it's affect on men especially when many self described feminists are happy to claim to want ""equality"" yet only want all the goodies and none of the bad. How many women wanted equality for being drafted and dying in Vietnam? How many want to split custody of the children 50/50 in divorce? How many want to pay for half of every dinner date in the courting process? Again...they want all the goodies of equality and none of the bad that men deal with....let's also not forget about the absolute assault on men with false claims of ""toxic masculinity"". 

You never hear a feminist say that when their is a house fire and some man runs through flames to save someone trapped inside...never hear that when there is an emergency and the words ""women and children first"" to escape the disaster..people love to see men die unequally...that's why the movie Titanic was such a popular film....so let's stop pretending that men aren't absolutely taken for granted for the sacrifices they make to protect and defend those around them. Modern feminism wouldn't be possible if MEN weren't willing to die so you could thank them by calling them ""toxic""...what an ungrateful and cruel joke this topic is...",1,2022-05-23T02:35:42Z,2022-05-23T02:38:38Z
@toninikolova468,"The only gender aspect in the Depp/Heard case is related to the fact that male individuals can be victims too. Like it or not, it happens. The positive in the situation is this case gave a voice to many males who are shamed for becoming a victim in a relationship. A person can be a victim at work, at school, as a child, but the narrative in society is ""you are not man enough if you allow this"", hence they don't seek support if this happens. This issue has little to do with feminism. The issue here is the exploitation from a group of people with high narcissistic traits of others. This is a mental health issue. We live in society where narcissism thrives, uses others for resources, feeds on their kindness and empathy, leaves destruction after itself and does not have integrity or accountability. It could be in the face of feminine or masculine individual. This case brings more awareness to the court system to take into account narcissistic individuals and the consequences of their behaviors on others.",0,2022-05-22T00:31:42Z,2022-05-22T00:31:42Z

@prschuster,"If men are weaker, maybe it's more about the economy. It's harder for one to support oneself, let alone a family, with the gap between rich and poor widening. Lack of opportunity, takes away incentive. This, coupled with a culture that allows unabated resentment against men in the media, is also a contributing factor. Saying that men all of a sudden drop out, of their own accord, explains nothing. Nobody knows what they're talking about here.",0,2022-05-08T19:03:21Z,2022-05-08T19:07:50Z

@ChanceX74,"I made sure to read Auguste's article before watching this video, which is a habit I've started to practice because it's always interesting what gets left out of the conversation when it takes place. While I partially fault Auguste for missing the opportunities to bring this up during their rebuttals, I found it curious that both Kim and Robby completely avoided the parts of his piece that mention the increase in fatherless homes and lack of male role models in visual and entertainment media, which is a direct result of modern feminism. Instead, they just fell on the tried and true ""maybe men just don't know how to deal"".

If you teach someone that they can get away with everything, they tend to believe they can get away with everything. This is especially true when you also give them a victim mentality and teach them that any attempt at balance from the other side is oppressive. I think the best example is when you hear Heard on tape saying ""Who's going to believe you?"" after admitting to assaulting him.

@juliusantao6248,"Hill has disappointed me with this one. what's the message here?       Let me shout out: Feminism is good when it is about empowering women but crossing the limits?  wouldn't that be same as men, crossing their limit? 
They said man abused women, kept her in the house and dishes, no rights etc, etc and so women need to empower, be strong, etc, etc. Fine, okay lets empower women but then what do we see? they end up doing the same as how men treated women in the past? 
(edit: out of the three i love Kim and infact i watch Hill mostly cos of Kim not that Ryan and Robby are not good at this but this piece doesn't sound like Kim) Kim goes to say probably man does not know how to handle it. Well so now we need to empower men how to be strong and live with a strong women. so this is like fighting the strong battle in the process all that love and compassion goes down the drain. It is all about values! Love, Discipline and responsibility. Modern feminism has in some way mislead in eliminating these values and further destroyed families.

@ifumusno6104,Feminism and feminist agenda has evolved beyond equality and turned into dominance and I think is what the guy trying to articulate but he didn't do his homework to battle the pushback. Jordan Peterson would have been better to sit with him on this interview. Men and women are not equal and the few ways they are don't generally make us equals. Women have always worked and did most of the home stuff. What's different is their attitude towards men now that they think we are on more even playing field. They throw around buzzwords like misogyny and toxic masculinity to shame men into being docile and to not think like men anymore. I have to constantly defend my masculinity against these ever so often attacks and combat this toxic misandry women have.,1,2022-04-28T22:29:27Z,2022-04-28T22:29:27Z

To be fair, that just shows one how badass those chosen few woman soldiers were at fighting. However, unlike Hollywood, I'm not a fan of rewriting history to make women the hero of every saga.

@michaeldietz4190,"I do think the guest hits on some things that are a problem in today's society. I would say where feminism has not helped men today is that men are often always identified as the problem by default. They're labeled as toxic, misogynist, etc right off the bat by society who has no idea of the inner workings of a relationship. That makes them passive and fearful of being labeled, so they will endure more than they would have in the past in toxic relationships. It's not so much men are struggling with a change in societal ""roles"" but rather the change in power dynamic that comes from a movement that asks everyone to ""believe women"" as the default setting. While that movement has been incredibly beneficial for cases of legit abuse/harassment, there is this byproduct of a minority of women using that power to manipulate and sometimes publicly scorn men illegitimately. Certainly doesn't mean the feminist movement hasn't been a net benefit for society, it has been very beneficial.

@ar4203,"The idea that women are only just now starting to ""use& abuse"" men ""just like men used to do to women 'in the past' "", is actually insane & delusional...there has always been unhealthy toxic abusive relationships coming from both partners, its just the fact that absue against women has historically & currently tended to get more attention because of the physical difference of men being stronger bigger etc which is an imbalance in power physically & there's thus a perception that women are more at risk from domestic physical abusive...but there has always been abusive relationships from both partners, the reason this case is getting so much attention is because they are both famous, but there is hundreds of cases of women being the abuser well before now. 

the idea that women don't come into a relationship wanting to be equal partners but to use & control & run the relationship(""like men used to"") is absolutely wild. that has nothing to do with women, or men, that's called the difference between a healthy versus unhealthy relationship, and BOTH partners /both men & women can &do have the ""unhealthy"" mindset, while in a healthy relationship neither partner does. 

his facts about men being weak & without ambition etc is also wildly baseless, it's like he read some YouTube comments & decided to base his whole worldview & write an article off of it, rather than actually look at the data that doesn't support more than maybe a word of his argument, which he even admits was ""generalizing""",0,2022-04-28T04:33:21Z,2022-04-28T04:33:21Z

The more I hear what she contributes the less it seems she bases her statements on facts, sound reasoning, or a good understanding of world history or any depth of understanding of any particular subject. Early in the show’s life, co-hosts seemed to more readily challenge her statements, but over time they cut back challenging her considerably as if they were advised to do so.  It can be hard to read body language and facial expressions, but it often looks like co-hosts are “biting their tongues” to avoid the same level of confrontation  demonstrated earlier in the show.

Feminism encouraged women that they don't need a man to live their lives, even if there are kids involved. More kids are growing up in fatherless homes than ever before being raised predominantly by women. Even when they go to school most teachers are female. This is having a significant effect on the nature of boys and men

Dismissing traditional gender roles of hundreds, perhaps thousands of generations in only one or two generations, can only end in disaster.  I don't understand how anyone can see this as a viable option.

Please don't imply that we have evolved to develop a superior perspective on gender roles.  It is obvious to me that a superior perspective would by necessity be accompanied by superior intelligence.

Very few are responsible for anything or take responsibility for very much which makes people by default, weak.  The mobs make it worse because there ALWAYS has to be a winner and there ALWAYS has to be a loser and it doesn't matter much what is true, just who has the bigger crowd supporting them.  All this makes the weak, weaker and the strong weak.  Imposter syndrome is becoming and will be the norm.

Robbie’s point that it’s actually women who are committing suicide more is true, but men have also increased (albeit at a slower rate).

I was being childish with my videogames and comics, nowadays girls proudly proclaim things that i was being 'scolded' for.
In other words, it was just a big mindf*ck, and that is also what i see in Amber Heard, aggressive gaslighting.",17,2022-04-27T15:44:22Z,2022-04-27T15:44:22Z

@XtomJamesExtra,"What an utter failure of a ""news"" piece.  You cannot nor should you use the Amber Heard Johnny Depp case as some posterchild example of the failures of Masculinism vs Feminism. They're not an example that is somehow emblematic of the greater social milieu. In fact, at this point the economy, social systems, political systems, and legal systems really don't care either way for either the Feminist or Masculinist, 99% of people live paycheck to paycheck, the nuclear family can't exist, and both traditional gender roles have effectively disappeared. Amber Heard is an abusive arrogant sadistic woman, who abused Depp and gaslit him. Depp took the abuse because of his parental upbringing and a refusal to hit a woman even in self defense. That doesn't make Depp weak, and calling him a ""weak man"" is defamatory.",0,2022-04-27T15:39:48Z,2022-04-27T15:39:48Z

Yea, not really, shield maidens arent really a thing. At best, there were some exceptions for the best of the best women, but acting like women just fought side by side with men as vikings is indicative of what's wrong with this Convo. 

As a woman, Kim can't be verbally confronted by guys like me honestly about topics like this without feeling ""aggression"".

@goligogo923,Depp is weak because he's not a fully developed person.  Same with ol Will Smith.  Their hardest part of of day is avoiding real people and pretending to be them on TV and movies.  Hollywood is VERRY toxic.  Waiting for the left to catch up with that.,0,2022-04-27T14:57:42Z,2022-04-27T14:59:46Z
@taniap3199,He simply dropped a wonderful partner and went for the psychopath. He liked the thrill and now he’s paying the consequences. Everyone in a relationship with a narcissist or personality disorder will be defeated. He wasn’t weak when he was with Vanessa. This is kind of a bs segment. Will and Jada would be a better example for what they are discussing.,34,2022-04-27T14:57:11Z,2022-04-27T14:57:11Z
