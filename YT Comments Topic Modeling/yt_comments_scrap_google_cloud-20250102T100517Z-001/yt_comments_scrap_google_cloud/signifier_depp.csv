@LeenMcBeans,"I really appreciate this take, belated or not. I remember at the time, I was working as an advocate for DV survivors, and even though I don‚Äôt tend to know or want to follow or discuss celebrity news, the underlying messages that were being derived from the Heard V Depp case were so problematic. But it was so viral, and I was skeptical of how natural that was too. From my understanding, this was part of Depp‚Äôs legal team‚Äôs approach or a key tactic. If my feed or media intake is FLOODED with all this information and I see so many people reposting funny memes about it, I might be prone to believe those people know something I don‚Äôt. Maybe they‚Äôre paying more attention to the case. And as someone that knows the stigma against male victims and how much harder it is for them to come forward, and how hard society pushes back and judges or dismisses them when they do, I agree it was tempting to take the different approach of ‚Äúmutual abuse‚Äù at best. Abusive relationships are not always black and white, there‚Äôs so much gray. But what is SO overlooked is just what you said. A victim finally reacting to abuse or energy constantly being steered their way or wearing them down can look a lot like abuse, in isolation. And it‚Äôs not remotely the same level. 

The power dynamic between Depp and Heard was unequal, fame and notoriety wise, money wise, and just due to him being a well loved white man and her being a ‚Äúless than perfect‚Äù white woman. 

At the end of the day I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to protect or save Amber Heard. It didn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I had limited energy and time to devote to issues each day. And sometimes the most I could muster is scrolling past the memes or posts about it, or not engaging in the conversation or pushing back slightly when I‚Äôm near it or someone tries to discuss it with me. Hardly ally behavior. I mean, ideally, that energy and time and effort should be focused on boosting voices that aren‚Äôt heard, are marginalized, and most vulnerable‚Äî and that‚Äôs literally what I was doing all day and it is exhausting to take on. 

I remember trying to put words and language to what felt off about the case, but it was like scrolling through 10+ Google pages or YouTube video pages at that time, and then I feel like I‚Äôm just looking for confirmation bias to an extent, you know? 

I don‚Äôt care about celebrities or their lives and don‚Äôt want to since it doesn‚Äôt affect my life and seems like a waste of time. But when something starts to represent a larger discussion or issue, especially for victims that are watching the news and scrolling the same media, it becomes important to look at more carefully. So thank you for this, it was cathartic and well argued and helped me find more language to map onto the ambivalence I felt back when it was happening.",0,2024-12-20T03:42:47Z,2024-12-20T03:42:47Z
@quirkyblackenby,I was abused my whole life by my mother. People really have no idea how the abusive dynamic works. If you isolated all of the times I yelled at her and said mean things to her you would think I was the instigator but then you add the context that I am the child and she is the parent. You have to add the years of mistreatment and abuse. You have to know what happened right before I lost my shit at her. Once you have the full context then you start seeing what‚Äôs really going on.,0,2024-12-19T23:57:37Z,2024-12-19T23:58:24Z

@estanceveyrac,"Having worked on the ground, in my community, in my geographical area against rape & abuse, supporting victims, I never really considered looking this. Saw the headline, didn't care. At a glance, my analysis was limited to the assertion that she had power, resources & agency. There is no point supporting people who are able to advocate efficiently for themselves, able to demand better treatment & demand support & privileged enough to receive some. 
Supporting victims for me that's been opening up my home for a few nights, helping with papers, with going to the tribunal, raising a little money for the worst situations, breaking down a door & helping someone pack their shit with speed, taking (forcing) a women to go wait for hours at the eye clinic  after the ER took care of her face & she thought that was enough & there was no point in checking with the specialist if her eye got damaged even thought the ER told her to go. 
Amber Heart is the wrong kind of victim for me not because she isn't a victim, but because her socio-economic situation doesn't warrant any help. She didn't get kick out to the street with nothing, she got a job & money, she got her papers (she isn't gotten get deported), she has the money to access medical & psychological help. She isn't in a situation to need help, she is in a situation of offering help to others, of placing herself in solidarity with people in worse situation than hers, not that it matters because her morality doesn't matter to me because she doesn't matter to me.

@lysabelle3990,"As someone that was being abused and didnt know it. The way we depict abuse is the issue. The worst abusers are the nicest, funniest, most charming, and helpful people. Unfortunately they craft an great image with everyone, who is not the victim/s ( who tend to be partners or children) . That image is actually how they get their victims in the first place. 

We as a society  have a hard time accepting that the person that we like and enjoy being around is abusive, and so even when we see the abuse. We give the benefit of the doubt, the same benefit of doubt the victims are giving them, which is exacerbated by abuser blaming victims for their own abuse. Usually by that time the abusers had broken the victim down so much mentally, coupled with the fact that the abuser treats everyone else nicely, that the victim believes them, that they are the one at fault for the abuse.",1,2024-12-11T19:54:23Z,2024-12-11T19:54:23Z

what hurt was the only tangible proof of abuse came from depps side. its a historical thing that happens where an abuser is able to spin the narrative so its possible this did happen. but as far as ""mutual abuse"" goes... me and the public after watching that trial at least came away with amber was the bigger perpetrator. but honestly its hard to have an opinion on people i aint ever met because of one trial. so when it comes up i just kind of dismiss it ""i don't know anything about that"" because yeah i dont and niether does anyone out there besides heard and depp. only they know the real truths",0,2024-12-11T12:56:36Z,2024-12-11T12:56:36Z

@xxsandeliciousxx,"One key aspect that often gets overlooked‚Äîand perhaps explains why many side with Johnny Depp‚Äîis that this case did not begin with the public trial. We could argue that this was a case of a powerful man escaping accountability for abuse, but the reality is more complicated. Johnny Depp was initially ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù after Amber Heard (or at least a tabloid) accused him of being a wife-beater. He sued the tabloid for defamation, but he lost that case because the publication claimed their information came from a ‚Äúreliable source‚Äù‚ÄîAmber herself.

For years, Johnny‚Äôs career in Hollywood was effectively over. He was not protected by patriarchy; instead, he was publicly condemned and ostracized. It was only after he sued Amber directly for defamation in this public trial that his reputation began to recover. At first, people did believe Amber. However, during the trial, his ex-partners testified in his defense, and recordings of Amber emerged in which she mocked him, saying he should ‚Äúgo and tell the world that [he], a man, was a victim of domestic abuse‚Äù to see who would believe him. She even belittled him as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù for walking away from physical confrontations.

Critically, Johnny had no prior history of abusing his partners, while Amber did. However, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that Johnny was far from perfect. He engaged in questionable behavior, as you‚Äôve pointed out. The issue is that both sides of this debate‚Äîpro-Amber or pro-Johnny‚Äîtend to cherry-pick evidence that supports their narrative while ignoring anything that contradicts it.

From what I‚Äôve seen, this appears to have been a case of mutual abuse, or perhaps Amber was the primary aggressor. That‚Äôs based on the evidence presented during the trial. However, discussions about the case often veer into political territory‚Äîfocusing on patriarchy and misogyny‚Äîrather than addressing the unique complexities of this specific situation. Many use it to further their agendas: red-pill communities to argue that women lie about abuse, or radical liberals to uphold a broader narrative about gender-based violence. This tendency to oversimplify creates a false binary in what is actually a deeply complex case.

For those who followed the trial closely, the claims made in tabloids‚Äîlike the infamous ‚Äúpoop in the bed‚Äù story‚Äîwere confirmed or debunked in court. Public opinion wasn‚Äôt shaped by media coverage alone but by the evidence presented during the trial itself. Unfortunately, some have used this case to fit a broader social discourse, lumping it in with unrelated cases and insisting that it exemplifies systemic trends. This oversimplification disregards the nuances of this case, as you‚Äôve done in your video.

The reality is that this trial was so complex and fraught with contradictions that many chose not to take a firm stance‚Äînot out of public pressure, but because it was genuinely difficult to determine clear-cut victimhood or culpability. As you pointed out, much of the recent support for Amber has come from far-left or feminist circles, while Johnny received backing from red-pill groups eager to discredit women. Both sides, however, have clear biases.

What‚Äôs frustrating is that you seem to have fallen into the same trap here‚Äîtreating Johnny with the same kind of scrutiny you claim Amber unfairly faced. Certain behaviors you suggested were unusual for a victim (based on reports from a doctor) were equally challenged when it came to Amber, as her own claims were debunked in court. This is why many people believe the truth lies in the middle: that this was mutual abuse and that their relationship was deeply toxic on both sides.

Ultimately, the case was not black and white. Treating it as such‚Äîwhether to support a narrative about patriarchy or to push back against feminism‚Äîonly adds to the confusion and polarization. This wasn‚Äôt a clear-cut instance of domestic abuse that can or should be used to bolster anyone‚Äôs political agenda. It was far more complex than that.",7,2024-12-10T10:52:09Z,2024-12-10T10:52:09Z
@bookNerd151,"I appreciate you speaking up, especially since leftist men desperately need to hear another man say that about Depp. I‚Äôm a bit‚Ä¶. confused about why you immediately undercut this by being judgey about Ms Heard‚Äôs personal life (yes, it was Musk, but men who don‚Äôt know anything making sweeping public judgment calls about who/how a woman is fucking is kind of the heart of the problem) and also assuming her claims to injustice are appropriated. 

Ms. Burke was criminally under-credited for her take on a popular anti-sexual assault campaign. Ms. Heard no doubt ‚Ä¢was‚Ä¢ assaulted by Depp, but her op-ed dealt with domestic violence. As an activist in both these areas, I am baffled as to why a woman speaking about her lived experience (while knowing, I might add, that she is about to be publicly dragged for doing so) is doing white feminism. All of the thousands of sexual assault and domestic violence nonprofits nationwide were doing this work since (in many cases) the 1970s or earlier. Of course it‚Äôs white feminism to quote a bunch of rich white celebrities about Me Too, and not give Tarana the platform she deserves. What Ms. Heard said in the paper was not that. 

Maybe you didn‚Äôt like her in Aquaman, and that‚Äôs fine. I hope you can see though how this video involved yet another random man loosely fabricating stuff about her and claiming it‚Äôs a statement on her character ‚Ä¶.. when in fact it‚Äôs more likely a statement about yours.

@natrodriguez7327,"I think its still complicated to this day. There's abuse victims who don't believe Amber, but there are also other abuse victims who do believe her. The internet seems to be biased towards Johnny, but major news agencies (reports,articles,tv segments) are biased towards Amber. The internet runs rampent sometimes and major news sites, do fail us as well sometimes- so it's hard to say who exactly is being biased. Honestly, misinformation seems to be everywhere. 

Personally, I don't know. Based on this video alone - I'm inclined to believe she was a victim. 

However, I do have questions- given that Johnny was a bigger celebrity and is a man, doesn't that mean there's no way it's possible he could be a victim? By virtue of his status doesn't that mean he always had the power in the relationship, so he can't possibly be the victim?

You also didn't mention the deposition tapes where she's seen laughing, smirking, and rolling her eyes during Johnny's testimony. She also did this during the trial. You can easily look up the tapes yourself on YouTube.

Sure, it may not have been human feces in the bed, I will give you that. But that does not excuse the visible pattern Amber has displayed while Johnny has went into relative obscurity immediately; which is what most victims do. They retreat. She went on press tours and was haled as a hero.

At that moment, I decided that no matter what happened, Depp is also a monster. No healthy, normal human being talks like that. Reading those messages made me feel physically sick.",5,2024-12-03T19:42:46Z,2024-12-03T19:44:50Z

seriously, you can watch. the. trial. and decide for yourself, the media narrative is so obvious on making amber as the victim of a conspiracy, when in the Trial she was triggering as an Abusive pos, doing all kinds of abusive behavior, and having evidence of Her being the one Violently punching and verbally assaulting Johnny.

@MsConstantComment,"I hyperfocused on this case when it was happening, watching almost all of the testimony and arguments, because of my personal experiences with DV, addicts and mental illness, and because I was a fan of Johnny Depp who is about my age. I was so disappointed with the verdict and the narratives pushed by the misleading media highlights of the trial and the vicious attacks on AH by influencers. Many clips of JD's pretty lawyer confronting AH on the stand as if she'd been proven in a lie when the testimony did not actually support that, in my view. In the beginning of the trial, when the prosecution was presenting their case, I was sympathetic to Johnny. But that changed when the defense side got their turn. Though I don't really love her, I found the majority of what she described believable and relatable. There was no question in my mind that he was abusive in many ways and an addict. And I agree with you that her behavior was a reaction to her abuse, and the fact that she was not a meek victim was used against her. I did not feel that the specific defamation charges were proven, but I think the jurors were persuaded by the optics of the prosecution team and that they didn't like AH, and JD is a better actor. I feel really sorry for her that her character was assassinated so brutally, especially after all she went through in that relationship.
    And I also watched Evan Rachel Woods' limited series about her and other women's abuse by Marilyn Manson, as well as other things about that case, and I believe her, and it appals me that JD is friends with that creep. I'll never see Johnny Depp the same way.",3,2024-12-02T19:59:32Z,2024-12-02T20:23:19Z
@XxXstrangekittyXxX,"I‚Äôm only halfway through this, but I can‚Äôt go any more. Please watch the trials that pertained to this topic instead of googling and watching people piece together clips. Amber lied about SO MUCH, and that was literally proven over and over in the trial with photo/video evidence and many eye witnesses from BOTH sides. She also did not elicit any emotion other than cringe from me or any of my friends that are all victims of at least some abuse/rape/SA. I am very sensitive to others‚Äô emotions - and I felt NOTHING for her when she was talking. I believe she was the abuser. The fact she‚Äôs friends with James Franco (watch the elevator video) is also just gross. I really like your videos and I feel like you bring up really good points 99% of the time. But this take is very misled and I urge you and anyone else reading this to watch the actual trials (the UK one and the US one) and THEN come to a conclusion.

I watched the trial live as it happened and did after study on each days broadcast correlated to previous witness and evidence testimony. The direct issue I have with this is the revealing parts that drew attention to evidence in the UK being manufactured for harsher publicity and infamy. You are talking about a trail in the US where Amber ran out of defense and had to pull new nonsense out for shock value like the ‚Äúbottle‚Äù statement. Please review some older as it happened sources and correlate her defense to how monstrous she really is. Like how she used blackmail and trafficking to control rich young males in Hollywood.

@safirestudio,"I watched this entire trial while it was happening. We gotta keep in mind that it was a defamation case and not a criminal case. At the end of the day, I agree with the jury. She was not believable, she was constantly lying and performing. The amount of inconsistencies in her stories just didn't make sense. The photos of her bruises simply did not match the alleged brutal beatings she described. Nothing, NOTHING,  matched. I am sure JD is no angel and living with an addict causes it's own trauma but what she was trying to put together just didn't make sense. Not only was she found liable for defamation ordered to pay $10mil. Her counter suit was all but thrown out. JD was ordered to pay AH $2mil for what his lawyer said to the police. Not even for something JD said himself. Let's remember this was a defamation case not a criminal case.  I am sorry for everyone who has suffered abuse. And I understand leaning toward believing Heard's allegations. After all, we say believe women. This is a case where the courts and public got it right, imho. The evidence simply wasn't there.",10,2024-11-24T07:10:29Z,2024-11-24T07:15:32Z
@FERDINANDVSLVCIVS,"OK. I never got to the bottom of that story and neither do I want to. The problem is, when those online accusations started popping up (and, yes, Heard's was one of them), progressivists flocked online to defend the pretty bonkers stance that women are to be believed no matter what, because the Justice is patriarcal, so we might as well just nod to whatever a woman says or something. Seemingly, that's not the stand you took, but 95% of progressisvists did, or at least adopted a vaguely complascent position, which in practice elevated this idea.

When you do away with due process and bring cases to the court of public opinion, you inevitably end up setting the stage for a popularity contest that is bound to be won by whoever can sream loudest, that is whoever has the most money and/or clout to buy up the media, boost social network adverts and just make their version better known.

And, I'm sorry, as a gay black man, I've seen plenty of fake 4b*se claims being hurled at men (including sraight white ones) for all sorts of reasons: from petty revenge for the stupidest personal quarrels, to battles of egos or even (especially) political disputes between leftwing parties competing for influence on a campus. So, yeah, while false reports used to be exceedingly rare, whoda known(?), turns out swapping victim-shaming for a women-are-always-right-full-stop mentality has insentivised bad faith females to exploit this new tool in their favour... Whoda known?

So my advice, a leftwinger myself, is: next time such a case blows up before public opinion, let's be prudent, not take sides and let the Justice investigagte it. Should therr be any problem in the Justice's handling of the case, then (and ONLY THEN) must social movents intervene, pointing exactly to what and where the problem is. But letting tonnes of cases be brought to this bonkers cyber-mediaeval court and then only complaining that this system is flawed after the side you hoped would win starts getting its 4rse kicked is pretty hypocritical.

I honestly believe media outlets should be banned from reporting on cases that haven't been judged on first instance minimum. And the fine should MONUMENTAL.",4,2024-11-23T19:24:39Z,2024-11-23T19:26:51Z

I would absolutely be willing to change my opinion with evidence but a LOT of the shit she did to him in court is similar to my case against abusive parents where I provided documented and recorded proof but was disregarded for being a minor female but they had nothing and their word was taken over mine‚Ä¶..I find it hard to accept when he has video evidence and all amber supporters have is the same evidence my mother had when she was leaving me black and blue every other weekend and no one listened because of societal standards and norms‚Ä¶..I was going to school with concussions and being told ‚Äúwell your parents are well known in the community and you just seem to be lashing out , these recordings were just taken on a bad day,

Who you are friends with says a lot about you as a person. Johnny sent some truly horrible texts to Manson about Amber. He promised wordwide humiliation and that's what he gave her.",15,2024-11-14T18:05:53Z,2024-11-14T18:05:53Z

@charmaine8261,"To be honest. I got dragged into the misinformation, obsessed with the trial and thought Amber was lying. What immediately after the trial triggered me was the online bullying she got. And how Johnny Depp never came out to say that this kind of treatment should stop. During the trial it was said that he wanted to restore his image, that he just wanted peace and that he was reasonable. 

But a reasonable person would never let anyone get bullied as much as she has. His silence felt cruel. And the way he let this cruelty go as far as it did, made me realise that this is a vicious man.",3,2024-11-13T12:17:22Z,2024-11-13T12:17:22Z

It's notable how the question of abuse quickly didn't even come up anymore and was suppressed with a mass of noise of Johnny-bias.

In Amber's testimony in the trial preceeding, she revealed how vindictive she is to the point when it came to paying her own lawyers for her loss she refused and refused to pay state taxes declaring since she sold her property in California she was no longer a resident despite and refused to pay for federal tax since she no longer had a home within the United States. Heard even planned a trip with Depp during his time of attempting to go sober and clean where she intentionally brought drugs, flirted with another man, just for Johnny to react to his wife and a man who was aroused.

@M4x4r0ni,"Don't get me wrong, I do agree that there should be a deeper discussion on the Amber Heard case in general. But to argue that Amber Heard was the victim is to ignore the trial in it's entirety. 
 Because friendly reminder, Heard lied about a lot of fucked shit during the trial: Claimed to have been beaten severely by Depp & covered it with makeup, proven to be bullshit by showing pictures later in the night of the claimed assault and not even a scab nor swelling in sight (which is important bc she claimed that she was beaten while Johnny was wearing his ""Chunky metal rings"", which would've caused very visible injuries that makeup cannot cover). Claimed that she was sexually assaulted by Depp with a glass bottle and apparently ""didn't need to go to the hospital after because she didn't think it was severe enough"", kinda just forgetting that vaginas don't work like that. And at multiple points not able to keep to a consistent story of what happened to her, there's a reason why people were making parody clips recreating what she described. (There's also how Heard was very obviously acting at various points during the trial, like to the point you don't need those analysis videos to pick up on it. She literally pauses mid ""crying"" until she hears a camera shutter go off.)
 Amber Heard also has a history of being an abusive partner. Also there's the claim floating around about Heard possibly abusive her sister but I don't remember if that was ever confirmed during the case, so take that with a grain of salt. Like the poop thing with Depp can be brought into discussion to highlight that Depp is pretty odd on his own, but to gloss over Heard's history? That's kinda important.
 It was proven during the trial that Amber Heard fabricated evidence during her relationship with Johnny Depp.
None of this is to say Depp is a saint himself, but to argue this hard against what was proven during the live recorded trial that you can readily look up on Youtube right now to double check to see if those videos were accurate is a massive flaw to this video.",5,2024-11-06T14:17:38Z,2024-11-06T14:17:38Z

Thanks for this video, F.D.! As a survivor on ongoing child abuse by a toxic narcissistic parent, there is a point where some of us become toxic and retaliate. It's survival.

23:29 This whole section here is why I have a serious issue with @TheKavernacle making a video pretty much saying we need to stop going after James Somerton. After all the !@#$ James Somerton did, he deserves the derision he gets. For !@#$'s sake, he pretended to off himself then rebranded and tried to sneak back in! Ever since Kav made that video I've been looking at him with a side eye and avoiding his content. He also has a [REDACTED] for Taylor Swift and gets real !@#$in' petty when folks criticize his hot takes about her. I was present and accounted for when he belittled and mocked members of his own audience in his responses in the comments section for liking Taylor Swift music as though our tastes in music reflects our mental aptitude. I have an ego. There's a thin line between being a quirky and fun egomaniacal !@# and just being a !@#$, and Kav crossed into just being a !@#$ that day. I honestly think I want to unsubscribe from him. He does a lot of good content, but the James Somerton thing together with the Taylor Swift thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. He's courting a certain kind of audience with the way he talks about Taylor Swift and it ain't the kind of crowd I have any interest in being associated with.",2,2024-11-06T02:27:21Z,2024-11-06T03:14:07Z
@jacobwaldrop8604,"Why leave out the leaked tapes of their therapy where she admitted to constantly physically abusing him, and then making fun if him because he wouldn't respond and would leave? Why leave out that the people that testified for Depp also worked for her. Many risked their carrers to testify. None of the evidence shows that he was the instigator. The worst thing we saw was where she tried to set him up and she verbally abused him until he threw some pans. Sorry but this video feels lazy.

Everybody better hope they never become the target of a covert narc. They can paint themselves as the helper, the good guy, the victim. The covert narc is a strategic master manipulator who will make people feel sorry for them and blame their victims.

In my case, I recognized what I was dealing with and delayed restraining order efforts long enough to collect enough undeniable evidence to make it clear who was being victimized. For people in her personal and professional life before me, she made them look like the bad guy and she got away with everything. Nobody believed them over the attorney, community activist, non-profit youth service contributor. In my case, every rebuttal was met with more evidence so even her judge friends had to take heed. 

Be careful judging these situations until you truly understand how covert narcissism works and how easily it can be missed in a woman.

@StolastheDemonOwl,"I'm at the part where you're expecting angry comments from viewers lmao. Growing up I was a huge Depp fan, it started with PotC and I got into more and more of his work. He was one of the only celebrities whose life beyond his films I was interested in, because he did a lot! He was a philanthropist, he had a band, yadda yadda yadda. And he'd broken up with a majority of his exes pretty amicably. When Heard came out and said he'd been abusing her, I immediately believed her and was so devastated that someone I looked up to, who made a name for himself being a quirky, fun, sweet guy, could do something like this.
Then the rumor mill started turning. Friends and past lovers of Depp came to his aid saying he was never abusive a day in his life, he recorded a lot of Amber's backlash and made it seem as though she initiated those attacks, I read articles about how her wounds were makeup with photos of the bruising seemingly moving over her face like she was consistent on where the placement was supposed to be, officers speaking with tabloids to claim she never reported him for his actions or that they investigated and found nothing, no one seemed to be able to stick to a story. And you know... I believed it. I thought 'how could a person be so vile to fake their own abuse while being the abuser?' not even realizing that that's what this man was doing the entire time.

I'm embarrassed by how quickly I turned against her, almost as embarrassed as I was when I first heard the abuse allegations, believed her, then was convinced she was lying and I'd turned on a celebrity I admired. I feel twice as much shame, especially as a victim of abuse myself. And not a perfect victim either, as I've escalated my own abuse in the past. I came to this video with a mind more closed than I'd like to admit, but you won't be hearing an angry comment from me. Just kind of a sad and apologetic one. And a grateful one that you took the time to make this video. I figured something must have been fishy because ""mutual abuse"" is not really... truly... a thing. And it's not unheard of for victims of abuse to engage in strange, reactionary, even violent outbursts in response to their abuse, sometimes even if the abuser isn't even in the room. I get really sad when I think about the times I've been mean to family and friends because I didn't know how to handle what I was going through. And knowing someone very publicly was going through the same shit and I was over here criticizing her for it.... I'm not the type of person to lash out at someone who takes the time to so gently and professionally offer a different perspective, who isn't mean or shaming about a lot of people, like myself, who had a lot of confused and passionate feelings about the whole Heard/Depp situation. I just want to thank you for your input once everything was said and done, and I won't sit here and lie, I'm so ashamed I'm tearing up a bit. I never meant to contribute in any way to the further harm of an abuse victim.

Anyway, thanks for the video. I'm a huge fan of yours, I've used some of your videos as reference for a few of my psychology papers in school. Graduated cum laude! :3

@mac533,"I think you've fallen victim to the fallacy fallacy, i.e., the idea that because people acting in bad faith used junk science and memes to hate on Amber Heard, that means she wasn't an abuser. The thing is, there are recordings of their arguments out there! Lots of them! And one thing that kept coming up is that Johnny Depp would try to disengage from their arguments, and Amber Heard would get mad at him and follow him! She literally calls him a coward at one point for not wanting to, in her words, ""fight for me!"" It's one thing to snap and hit someone who is abusing you. It's another thing ENTIRELY to corner someone and actively prevent them from leaving a volatile situation!

It's especially funny that the reason there are so many recordings of their arguments is that Heard was gaslighting Depp so hard that he literally needed an objecting recording of reality. There's a line that lives rent-free in my head, where Heard tells him something, and he responds ""Listen to the tapes. That's what they're there for.""

She was a liar, an unreliable witness. If you watched the TRIAL (not the bullshit social media that was buzzing around it) it was clear the right side won.

I don't care about their other mental health issues. When Amber Heard provided the video evidence of her and Johnny in that house, him slamming cabinets and swearing, he met the definition of intimidation and that meets the criteria of domestic abuse. Period. So she did not ""slander"" him by writing an article that represented her view and her experiences.

I'm not discussing the power, fame, and wealth imbalance. I'm not discussing the age gap. I'm not discussing BPD or substance abuse disorders. Clear and straight line, that video depicted domestic violence, and that makes her a victim of domestic violence. Whether we like her or agree with her is irrelevant. 

Men can be and are victims of domestic violence and of abuse. I believe in some instances, Johnny could have been.

@robinronin,"People are VERY afraid of backlash. I've mostly seen support for Amber as short mentions in long videos exploring a bigger topic, which helps those creators dodge the backlash a little more. The intense hatred from a lot of men that defending Amber invites is... deeply vile. I was a JD believer at the time of the trial, too, because content defending him was just EVERYWHERE and, how could everyone be wrong? Well... they were. JD was a more engaging actor on the stand. He won by being a man and being a better actor. That's NOT how the system should work.

I also think Amber's team did her no favors by having her double down on some major things. Like, when it came to the donation, she should have just said: ""I pledged, I wanted to donate, but I was already aware that JD would sue me and I realized that I would need the money to defend myself, plus living expenses etc were higher than anticipated because I literally lived trapped by JD's people for YEARS so I kind of forgot what the outside world was like"", because that's the very obvious truth. IIRC, she did allude to that, but the whole discussion got so tied to ""the meaning of pledged vs donated"" that it all got lost. Which means that the audience has to make the logical steps in their own head, which the masses just cannot do. They believe what they see and stop there.

@cloelles,"The truth is not found in ANY commentary video of Depp vs Heard, yours included. We will never know exactly what is the truth but getting as close as possible to the facts is to inspect the court case and all the evidence provided there. ALL actual evidence including testimonies and audio recordings point to the same conclusion that the jury came to, which is that Heard lied about the abuse. Depp IS a victim of domestic abuse by Heard. You have to understand that Heard has been diagnosed to have borderline personality disorder and it makes perfect sense even to a commoner in combination with all the audio evidence presented at court not to mention the rest of the evidence. There were multiple testimonies of people witnessing uncontrolled fits of rage and abuse towards humans coming from Heard. Evidence of violence towards humans is not there with Depp. Only objects. Banging cabinets and writing with blood is not evidence of violence toward any living being. The only witness that Heard had to point to Depp as the aggressor was her own sister and another evidence showed that this sister is in fact scared of Heard herself because of the ""extreme violence"" her sister is capable of - in her own words. The evidence is stacked in favour of Depp and I'm saying this as a devout feminist. Heard is unfortunately not well. She is not evil but has a personality disorder.

You can't argue the man was an abuser because other men were like that and that the woman is for sure the victim.

@wwbit,"I think another important factor why the narrative of this trial went the way it did is because of how closely it followed the COVID pandemic and all that went with that--domestic violence incidents increased because victims were trapped in their homes day and night with their domestic abusers. COVID lockdowns and restrictions caused women especially to lose their employment and independence. It took years for women's employment levels to recover. Women are far more vulnerable to DV abuse because they carry the bulk of the caretaker burden in society, both for kids and elderly parents, while being paid less for the same work/job title at officially recognized employment. So women who are best able to understand and empathize with Heard's situation were also the most exhausted and stressed by the state the entire world was in. I remember when the trial was ongoing I didn't have the time or energy to take on the deluge of hate towards Heard. I searched and not even a single video result came up defending or taking a neutral stance toward Heard came up. This trial was an escalation in social media weaponization that had not been seen before. The closest I remember is what happened to Anita Sarkesian but this was mainstreamed to a whole new level.

@danguillou713,"I was unemployed and depressed at the time, and spent way too much time watching recaps and footage from this trial.
My impression from what came out in that trial is that Heard was the abuser in that relationship, and that Depp was the abusee.
I‚Äôve been in an AR, my wife‚Äôs been in another one, I have friends with experiences of abusive relationships, I‚Äôve worked with social service workers and I‚Äôve read a fair bit on the subject. I‚Äôve been on the jury. In a few trials with abusive relationships.

I don‚Äôt see any of the typical signs or behaviours from abusers from Depp, but I see a lot of them from Heard, most of them out of her own mouth.

I‚Äôm sorry, but to me it looks like you‚Äôre falling into the assumption that the female will be the victim and the man will be the abuser, because that‚Äôs the more common case. That is true, but it puts men who‚Äôre in the victim position in a really bad place. They‚Äôre not heard, they‚Äôre not seen, they‚Äôre not believed, and frequently they‚Äôre not taken seriously even if they‚Äôre believed.

The same thing is true for trans women and people in bi or gay relationships, btw.

I agree with you on gamergate and everything else outta history. But that doesn‚Äôt make Heard not an abusive partner. Do I know she‚Äôs guilty and Depp innocent? Absolutely not. But looking at the preponderance of evidence, brought out in that trial, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about somebody I knew getting into a relationship with Depp, but I would really worry if they started dating Heard. Or non-famous people in similar positions.

So that‚Äôs my take. A as lefty feminist. Not all abusive relationships look like the standard patriarchy model, and if we go in with that assumption, we‚Äôll be blind to non-typical cases.

That‚Äôs my take, cheers",3,2024-10-22T15:38:28Z,2024-10-22T15:38:28Z

It's a phrase I lump in with ""Global Warming""; it was coined with the very best of intentions, but it was a placeholder. A placeholder for an honest but more complicated concept, but holding onto it isn't helping anymore. Because it's over-simplified, it doesn't really express what NEEDS to be expressed.

That being what you elaborated on: ""Take accusations seriously"". Which I wholeheartedly agree with.",3,2024-10-22T07:20:39Z,2024-10-22T07:20:39Z
@KethusNadroev,"I begame a bigot when I started following the case of Vic Mignogna in 2019 and seeing how everyone was supporting the women, no questions asked, even if their accusation was ""he whispered something in my ear 8 years ago and it was so horrible that I forgot what he said"". Mignogna lost his career anyway and pretty much hasn't had any roles since. With Depp's case it felt good to see a woman finally not get away with it, even if Depp also got immediately kicked out of PotC from the initial ""man bad"" kneejerk reaction.

I don't agree with the video, even though I don't remember what exactly happened during Depp's trial. There were lawyers covering it, showing how she faked stuff and so on. I'm not sure what will take to convince me to go to the other side. Showing me instances of women being abused by men will only solidify my perception that society views men as inherently sexist, racist, transphobic, and so on. And that slowly starts to apply for me because I keep hearing things like ""this incredibly boring and preachy movie that emasculates men has a woman lead, so if you don't like the movie, you're a misogynist.

@Khumzwi,"Forgive me if I‚Äôm confused, but I need to speak my mind‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit long. Amber Heard used society for personal and financial gain, and I believe many have forgotten that we initially supported her when the news first broke.

That was over a decade ago, long before many who tuned into the trial during quarantine even knew the depth of their toxic relationship. With more time on their hands, people followed the details of the case closely. Back then, Amber was seen as a young, relatively unknown woman with ambition, married to one of the most famous and wealthiest men in the world. Society rallied around her, driven by the power dynamics we often associate with young women involved with powerful, older men. She claimed to be a victim of domestic violence at Johnny Depp‚Äôs hands, and we believed her.

The trial was based on an article that subtly implied Depp had abused her during their marriage ""two years ago."" At first, Amber claimed the article wasn‚Äôt about Depp, but in the same court, she later admitted it was, directly contradicting herself and her own witnesses‚Äô testimonies. She didn‚Äôt even provide her phone‚Äîlikely because, as many suspect, she had plotted this from the beginning of their relationship. In a recording, she actually admitted that she planned all of it, waiting for the ""right time"" to show her so-called proof. But her evidence revealed one thing to the world: she lied. She said her phone was lost and nothing was saved in her iCloud‚Äîconvenient, isn‚Äôt it? Her own witness acknowledged that the article was about Depp, and Amber had to prove it, but the evidence just didn‚Äôt hold up.

We ostracized Johnny Depp, canceling him without hearing his side. He lost two major roles and was vilified across social media. Amber had society‚Äôs unwavering support. Personally, after watching the trial, I felt betrayed by her. She positioned herself as a figurehead of the MeToo movement‚Äîalmost as if she were Nelson Mandela‚Äîwhen in fact, she was the oppressor. We stood by her, and for the longest time, we thought she stood with us.

What I can‚Äôt grasp is why we refuse to acknowledge that a young, attractive woman with little acting experience held more power than one of the most famous and wealthy men in the world. Amber knew that society tends to side with young women in relationships with older, richer men, assuming there‚Äôs always a power imbalance. But in this case, the dynamics were far more complex.

We supported her because of what she represented, who she was, and who she was with, and in doing so, we silenced Johnny Depp for years. She was even paid $30,000 per event to speak about domestic violence‚Äîviolence she claimed to have endured from Depp. We believed her. But the trial uncovered the truth: she not only lied but was also abusive.

What was most disheartening were some feminists suggesting Amber should still be supported, even if Depp was innocent, because so many women have suffered from domestic violence. They claimed a woman couldn‚Äôt be abusive because of her physical inferiority to a man, ignoring the overwhelming evidence. Even Amber‚Äôs own witnesses never saw Depp being abusive, while her best friend admitted that Amber hit her in public. There‚Äôs also evidence of her abusing her ex-wife at an airport.

I know this opinion will likely receive backlash, but it needs to be said. With predators like Cosby, Weinstein, Epstein, and R. Kelly, the victims‚Äô stories were eerily similar, aligning with the M.O. of each perpetrator. In Depp‚Äôs case, however, his ex-partners came forward to defend him. And let‚Äôs not forget the term ""perfect victim""‚Äîa concept that doesn‚Äôt exist. Using this idea to defend Amber only further harms victims, especially women of color, who may now feel even more reluctant to report abuse for fear of not being believed.

For so long, Amber was seen as the victim, but the trial showed the truth: she lied and was, in fact, the abuser in the relationship. I don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt accept that.",6,2024-10-22T01:23:56Z,2024-10-22T01:23:56Z

@chojay13,"In the spirit of being transparent, Im a pro-Depp white woman. Hopefully, you'll keep reading because I figured Id be accused as much if I left it out, and Im not going to spend this comment bashing Amber because the vitriol online was abhorrent. 

All I wanted to point out, though, is that this video only has two arguments to actually discredit Johnny's story: the poop in the bed and the blood writing on the wall. The rest of it is commentary on the attack of women who make accusations and the true problem of misinformation being personal alignment, not truth.

And both takes were essentially ""thats crazy, why would we believe that was evidence of his abuse. He's an addict who does crazy shit all the time, of course he's abusive."" 

Thats not a super strong reveal. Thats not ""evidence"". Thats opinion of evidence, and highly biased itself against addicts at that. But i also understand actually getting into the nitty gritty of such an involved case is an undertaking in itself for a brief popup of an image in another video that pissed people off and was truly very hurtful for many. 

No one will ever know what happened behind closed doors except for them. For me, there was a lot more evidence that Amber was abusive towards someone who struggles with addiction. And had very volatile and toxic behavior related to that as well, 100%. But for me, Johnny feels like the imperfect victim of abuse in this case. But there are other opinions. Just wanted to say a video about Misinformation, to me, didnt actually do a great job of combatting it and did some things that could actually perpetuate it too. 

And just to say: Per his testimony, Johnny's finger was severed by being *crushed* by the bottle against the bar-top while he was sitting there and his hand was hanging over the side. His finger being cut was a crushing injury per his statement. Which is supported by the evidence you provide to discredit it.",11,2024-10-21T14:52:26Z,2024-10-21T15:04:12Z
@awsomebot1,"Interesting video. I never followed this case and I'm ready to believe Johnny Depp was the real abuser, having first heard this perspective from Lindsay Ellis (who unfortunately doesn't go into much detail since her video is mainly about The Beatles).
However, I think your video has some problems.

5:02 I agree accusations should be taken 100% seriously, but that's not what ""believe all woman"" literally means. This phrase has done a lot of damage overall with normies rightfully going ""but what about evidence?"" which they wouldn't be saying if the phrase was more akin to ""take allegations seriously"".
5:44 Just because a group is targeted more often doesn't mean other groups suddenly lose validity. Even if it's not a widespread issue, false accusations definitely can happen, and we shouldn't invalidate victims.
18:44 til 21:20 comes off as very wrong to me. That white women are almost being collectively punished for historical reasons. Maybe I'm misinterpreting what you're saying, but it seems crazy to hold historic facts against Amber Heard if she is a victim.",4,2024-10-21T14:35:44Z,2024-10-21T15:21:48Z

@mata-jh9hi,"If JD was an abuser he would have kicked her out of his apartment when her affair with Elon and Franco was evident. He would have forced her to pay the 8M punitive damages but he didn't. The defamation suit was for his children. As a survivor I and many other survivors found many flaws in her behaviour and seriously where is the physical evidence that JD even hit her once. No swelling, bruising or blood clotting in the eyes. Oh please this is disgusting labelling him an abuser with no physical evidence, this is Defamation. Amber was callous and condescending with a history of drug abuse and problematic behaviour. Why was her friends not at the trial offering emotional support? Eve Barlow was kicked out after desperately trying to sabotage witnesses testimony. Where are the other Victims? Even Me too had to step down. Why pledge her divorce settlement to children's hospital if she wasn't honest enough to follow thru. I hope you enjoy the clicks without a thought about the turmoil JD's family endured. When you have dependents you have to protect them. JD has moved on Amber is where she is because she is a lousy toxic actress. AH and Elon's relationship was also DV coded.

@0hushpiper0,"It feels weird to not emphatically nod along with a video from a great essayist about the ways that white feminism fails to be intersectional and cherry-picks ideas they like from Black feminism without giving credit to where they got them from, but... I wish this video had been better researched? I know, it's a b-side, and I do get that this trial is an incredibly hard one to research and that reliable sources are scarce if not nonexistent--but from what I gather, the sources here are basically all secondhand from other youtube videos and youtube creators--and not terribly strong ones. (Apologies to Lindsay Ellis.)

None of us has time for me to do a whole debunking of the sources--least of all me--but to give just one example: one of the sources claims that it's unlikely that Heard sent the ""kitchen video"" to TMZ herself, because under freedom of press laws (presumably the 1st amendment + fair use exemptions) TMZ is allowed to publish that video without permission of the copyright holder because it is ""newsworthy"". We live in a world where everybody--newspapers, encyclopedias, blogs, lyrics websites, fanfiction websites, youtube channels, etc etc--either spends gobs of money buying publishing rights to the things they use in an effort to avoid getting sued, or crosses their fingers and hopes they're too small to sue, yet TMZ can publish somebody else's video without their permission just because they think people will be interested to hear about it? They published it for commercial gain, they lowered its value to other potential buyers by publishing it, they added little to no significant context to it, and they didn't change or transform it beyond just slapping the TMZ logo on it. None of this says ""fair use"". TMZ bought/secured the rights to that video, same as any other news outlet does, and basic common sense should have made that obvious.

That probably sounds really nitpicky, but it's meant to demonstrate the lack of critical thinking and education on the topic that the sources have. And I don't apply this to only pro-Heard sources: I gave up on pro-Depp commentary approximately 1 month after the trial ended, because they were so often nasty, biphobic or generally ill-informed (in general but particularly about mental health and abuse, as well as some aspects of the case--e.g. the ""broken bottle"" thing), and because my face was becoming bruised from facepalming so often. I unfollowed all but one of the youtube commentators I'd watched the trial with. I'm not surprised that a lot of people became disillusioned with that side. But... the pro-Heard side is really not much better, from what I've seen. Which I think is perfectly demonstrated by the way they eagerly platformed vicious, racist, misogynistic and/or TERF commentary shortly after the trial, and to a much lesser extent now.

Anyway: researching the trial effectively is really, really hard--partly because it was so long, and partly because it's so fraught. I can't think of a single news story or opinion piece I've seen that wasn't wildly ill-informed at best. For myself, I sought out a commentator with a starting attitude I could feel good about (the urge to protect the victim, Amber Heard in this case), the ability to hear the case on its own merits, and the necessary domain knowledge that I lacked (strong familiarity with the legal system, with trials, and with survivor testimony specifically). As far as I'm aware, none of the sources cited here really fit the bill there. They have opinions, some of them have viewed the trial and reviewed evidence outside the trial, and that makes them come off as very informed, but they lack the background or domain knowledge to accurately analyze that information, and they so often just... don't have basic critical thinking. Good sources are hard to find, but those are particularly bad, and I wish they were better.",3,2024-10-20T21:28:26Z,2024-10-20T21:28:26Z

@karyntownsend,"14:25 into the video. I've always been a huge JD fan,I followed the court case from spring to midsummer . And I have been in 3 major abusive relationships,with narcissistic men,in 3 very different ways,and I am not saying that I am at all perfect,but more like,extremely,naive,taken that I have a waaaay to heavy gutfeeling,yet,almost always have been trying to ignore it,and there comes the naivety,which is must likely a fake naivety,since I have had strong emotions of self-hatred,since I was 4 years old,yes,aboundedment- wounds,which,still is a huge issue  now 45 years later,from my mother leaving to start a new family,and my dad did somewhat the same,shortly thereafter. I have TRIED to learn how to hate people who hurt me,throughout my like. But it appears that I can't,HATE,in the true meaning of the word,(not when it comes to other people BUT MYSELF),. My point is,is that I saw a lot of things in between the line's in this case.... Meaning,I would never see your point as wrong nor would I hate on you. I saw something in JD's,eyes many times,after he won the case. Just as I saw it in Zelenskey,President of Ukraine,when he spoke in a mega screen,asking for more and more,when he knew he had won over the world's sympathy,(he is not a good man,it was in his eyes,and I saw something very similar in JD's eyes,after he won over the world,too)...... With that said,knowing that JD and Marilyn Manson has been freinds since before JD's daughter was born,and they both have a very eccentric humour,and MM,always,has shown himself as an odd personality,I do not one bit believe that he ever was the monster he has been betrayed to be..... He is actually one very,extremely,sweet,shy and gentle man,behind the scenes.... ( believe me,I KNOW,üòâ)

I can see what you mean about not liking Amber Heard. I am pretty sure I wouldn't want to, like, hang out with her based on how she comes off sometimes. But then there are the videos of her, one where she takes the time to talk with a deaf fan in ASL.

And she's not just getting through ASL and Spanish, she is comfortable and genuine with the languages.

Basically I expected to be reminded of my ex by JD but it was Heard who gave me flashbacks, now that isn't proof of anything especially since society loves a ""crazy btch"" story and demonizing a woman I just don't know the ins and outs of the relationship to determine this is the case here....also JD was an awful human too in the duration of the relationship in fact if the past is evidence he most certainly was.",1,2024-10-20T00:01:39Z,2024-10-20T00:10:21Z
@1michelemichele1,"""We"" didn't let Depp get away with anything, SBS. I watched the trial without fandom clouding my judgment -- in fact, when Heard's accusations first hit the headlines, like millions of other women, I believed her. It's a topic that's like walking in a minefield & it'll stay that way until something else falls in place (I'm serious: more men coming forward will break down more walls. 'Toxic masculinity' is real, and it effects everyone). Something had made me uneasy, though, I forget what it is, so I watched the trial to see what was what.

I'm not happy with the way msm handled reporting the trial and its verdict. Some refrained from editorializing about something they hadn't sent a reporter out to cover full time, others: no.  They figured that the occasional visit to the courtroom & ?news clips? would suffice: wrong again. It was highly unfair to Depp, and it was an insult to the rest of us, esp those among us who counted on a paper's rep to keep it on its toes (I can't for the life of me remember which one it was that shocked me so much -- it may have been the NYT ((they've failed before)), but it could also have been WP)). 

The whole poo thing was comic relief eh -- that isn't what his case rested on. 

That P Diddy got away with so much for so long doesn't mean Depp got away with something, too, and I may not feel as empathetic for the pump-and-dump actors and rockstars who discard women like they're trash -- that doesn't make them rapists*.

I think the anti-heard side was artificially amplified by malicious actors but I have no proof.

@HummingFeather,"Thank you for speaking on abuse victims who end up hurt by those they seek help from. Often times identity becomes an issue when people do not make space to hear out or intervene in situations of abuse. Much of what identity has done is divide a long standing set of experiences for many survivors who need to not be taken for granted. When those who deem themselves worthy of being helpers in community further marginalize, gossip, and create false narratives for those surviving in abuse, they repeat abelism, colonization, and become the true enemy. No one is replaceable.

@aemortalidiot3979,"I still think there is a place for pure fact videos on these sorts of things.
I may be alone? But the 13 minutes I've watched of you has converted me from the assumption of Heard's guilt to a more nuianced, (I have absolutely no fucking idea what is going on) stand point.

I'd love a more condensed version as you frequently add your own talking points that are adjacent and relevant to the subject but I have personally heard/seen repeated time and time again (with pretty much any other position on most conflicted arguements/political statements/etc) so it makes it harder for me to watch. Which i admit is probably not the case for everyone, but it is for me sadly.

I think for me, it's not as much that I was a diehard johnny simp. But that more fair-minded media was hard to find. And the other side of the conversation that I did see, and see in some comments below, have a lot of assumed contexts that someone like me is missing. This leads to points being seen as completely insane and nonsensical, making it very hard for me to take them seriously. This is something I've found in different situations where I have gone to ask questions to get another perspective. But because I lack knowledge I am ignored or assumed to be a troll when I legit do not know anything different or where to find the information.

So whilst I understand sometimes people might seem like brainwashed idiots, I totally understand not wanting to waste time and effort explaining the history of the earth to them.

@Thaelyn1312,"My fellow white women really, really need to step away from the need to paint most abusers as cis men. While I understand & also support the statistics that cis men are the ones doing most of the violence, we will better support all victims by making it more of a fight against *abusers*, not just men, & supporting & centering victims. Just make it about that. Talk about rape culture. Sure, yes, marginalized gendered people are usually victims, but if we stand by that masculinity somehow=Bad, well then lots of victims fall through the cracks of support. Which is cruel. Plus, it puts us in a state of thinking we can't possibly be abusive, when we very much can (& are, a lot of the times!)

@brmbkl,"as a fan, fd, this makes me sad, 
the discourse about the memes, and the misuse of this case in the media as a dark horse is interesting

but if you haven't got a clue about what transpired, don't talk about the facts
https://youtu.be/bblB5FtbnkU?t=393 some really bad takes from this point on

dark humor is just that, dark humor - if you read some of the other survivors down below, you would know that's a coping mechanism

yes, it would seem reasonable to think that a dog did a little no no in the bed, but if you lived with not so reasonable people, you expect anything

you can talk all about how women are inclined to be judged harshly by society, and labeled historically as hysterics, but that doesn't change the facts in this case

she filmed him while falling asleep with spilled ice cream, to prove that he was a horrible man - which, in a rape case, proves ,,,? if you didn't read the texts between Amber and her gang of friends, you would indeed think that he had all the power i the relationship, but that's not what seems to be the case
at every turn, Amber and her team have checked every box to drum up support for her case by sensationalizing her case - (which is indeed not a big red flag in itself  - in this media landscape) - until it backfires - that same bed was the battleground for the essence of this case, where a dent made by a sharp object was suddenly physical proof of his boots on that bed while abusing her-  spinning some chipped wood into not only supposed abuse, but ""horrific"" and ""scenic"" abuse
supposed evidence? or dramatization?
disregarding her stunt with Tmz, the only proof we have of the toxic relationship is material she made herself, where they both didnt come out looking pristine - and in doing so, she revealed more about herself than she wished - how is that in any way filtered by society's sexism?
this case isn't proof of bias against women, it only proves that sometimes women can be violent
that's it
yes, coming up with meagre evidence can point to desperation, but it's still just that, lacking in evidence
it doesn't say the opposite, where all desperate people are the victims and should be believed
all this Inception type twisting of logic is getting out of hand

just because there's prejudice (about hysterical women) doesn't mean she's not a liar, and just because the evidence points to her being a liar, should we know tell ourselves that maybe we are meant to think she is a liar?",2,2024-10-18T20:26:49Z,2024-10-18T20:45:13Z
@cajonesalt0191,"I'm willing to admit that I jumped into the stupidity and thought it was an equal thing until this very moment. I was one of those people who said she should also have her roles cancelled after everything came out. I haven't watched the whole video here. I just personally got out of a toxic relationship where there was constant disrespect, dismissiveness, and manipulation thrown at me, but I was always labeled the only one wrong because I reacted confrontationally. I didn't even have to watch this video. I didn't even have to read more than two comments. It was instantly obvious to me, just from the partial facts I remember, that Heard was only reacting to how she was being treated. Exactly how I was reacting. I took Depp's side, not really thinking it was all Heard, but feeling like it's not acceptable to respond to violence with more violence. I'm of the opinion that all violence justifies further violence in the eye's of history, but that's separate. Not everyone feels the same or believes the same things, and even in my strong anti-violent state I still screamed some crazy stuff at people. My way out was to say it doesn't matter who is right or wrong anymore, I just have to get out of this and end the relationship. But that was the only thing I had on the line. My own feelings. Not my reputation, my ability to work, and especially not my safety. I wish I could apologize to her. Only thing I can really do is make sure I never participate in that kind of crap again. Even if I believe they're both wrong, that's the stand I should make, not saying, ""Well, they're both wrong, so I'll side with this guy.""

Separately, I've been getting into religious apologetics. ""They don't believe it because it's true, they believe it because it's their truth."" In religious discussions, they call it dogmatism. People are dogmatically patriarchal, dogmatically sexist, dogmatically racist the same way they can be dogmatic about religious belief. The facts aren't important, what they choose to believe to support their own structuring of power and hierarchies is what's important.",2,2024-10-18T20:14:49Z,2024-10-18T20:31:31Z

@Nicktals,"imagine being abused on tape, having it admitted to on tape, being told you're a wimp for not fighting back on tape, being told no one will believe you if you try to say you were abused on tape, then being publicly smeared and gaslight by your abuser to the public (with the help of the ACLU after heard paid them a cool million to smear depp without saying his name), convincing them that you're the abuser and not the victim. Such a sad story. Thank God the trial was televised or she likely would have pulled it off, with no substantial evidence. She was absolutely right when she said people wouldn't believe him that a man could be abused, even after admitting on tape to hitting him on more than one occasion.

Depp is self destructive and said some horrible things, but all of the evidence points in one direction. The people who disagree hang onto the UK trial that allowed hearsay, and did not demand actual evidence of abuse. A report of abuse was enough. The evidence the UK courts accepted that was attempted to be presented as proof in the US was where the malicious intent comes in. The claims did not at all match the evidence. She made extreme claims and there wasn't evidence to back it up, which we didn't learn until the u.s. trial.  Telling a doctor you broke a bone and having the doctor write that down is not the same as the xray of the bone. There was never an xray.",12,2024-10-18T14:03:26Z,2024-10-18T14:15:36Z

@SeairraAnn,"Honestly I watched the entire trial and I think this is wrong. The reason that so many people supported Johnny was that the claims that he made were supported by more credible evidence, while Heard had very little evidence to support her claims. This held up in court and is the reason that Depp won the defamation lawsuit. While I don't think Depp is blameless in this situation, I feel that the characterization of him as an abuser and Heard as the victim is not supported by the evidence. I am a woman and a feminist (not some incel loser) and again I watched the majority of the trial. Heard lost the defamation lawsuit for a reason.",20,2024-10-18T08:56:07Z,2024-10-18T08:56:07Z
@amyk6319,"As a woman, survivor, & very liberal person who considers myself a feminist, your entire video is pure BS propaganda. To really know the truth about the Depp v. Heard trial, you would have to actually watch the trial. Heck anyone who just watched Amber Heard's full testimony knows that this woman is the abuser in this relationship. So many female victims believed Depp was also a victim, not because we liked POTC & Jack Sparrow, but because when we actually watched Amber's testimony, we saw her behavior, not Depp's, was just like our own abusers. Her arrogance & constant gaslighting were very triggering. 

But God forbid someone have to actually watch even the 48hrs of Amber Heard's testimony or even consider the opinion of someone who understands law before making a YouTube video claiming to know the ""real truth"" of the case so many years later. Instead it seems you, like many others continue to try to rewrite history because you find this case inconvenient, because it doesn't fit in to your narrative about abuse & victims. Accepting the fact that a wealthy man could also be the victim of domestic abuse would make it impossible to continue prejudging people based on your preconceived tropes of victims & perpetrators. More importantly, it would mean that people like yourselves who constantly make themselves the judge, jury & executioner before actually knowing the facts are no better or different than those responsible for the many black men who spent decades in jail based on false accusations.

If you want to understand what really happened in this trial & not just the vapid opinions of people trying to push an agenda, just go watch it yourself or at least watch the 48 hrs of Heard's testimony, which is what truly determined the outcome of this trial. At the least, look at the opinion of legal experts who actually watched the whole trial. Shockingly they all came to the same conclusion, that Amber Heard was the perpetrator. But definitely be cautious of the opinions of those in the mainstream media, since it was obvious that they did not actually watch it (some were even attributing deep fake videos online to actually happening in the courtroom). The only reporter who was actually in the courtroom every day was Angenette Levy from Law & Crime Network.",12,2024-10-18T08:30:11Z,2024-10-18T08:30:11Z

But in the scope of the trial, she was wrong and made so many mistakes. Even the claims of having so much evidence and that her lawyers screwed up (made after the case was over) made her look very bad and as if she would blame anyone but herself for the situation.

Johnny ain't a victim in any way, he has a track record of weird and unstable behaviour, and so does Amber. The problem for me is we took a case that was not talking about who abused who and made it about it.

I might be wrong, and if i am i hope someone can explain stuff to me in a way i can understand, but my personal take is that they both suck and both do very shady things.

@perplexedbystander6203,"I'm an elderly lady, a pensioner and I live in England so obviously I don't move in the same circles as film stars.  There was a young lady who was jailed a while ago in England.  She didn't physically abuse people but she made up tall tales about men sexually assaulting her.     After the trial the men she accused spoke to news outlets and were obviously very emotional.  It gives me pause for thought that Mr Depp as an alleged DV was laughing and joking in the court room.  I'm not saying I live a life where I regularly encounter DV victims but those I have known have been upset thinking about their abuse.  If anyone wonders about the case I'm referring to look up ""Eleanor Williams case"" or ""Ellie Williams case"".  I think she'd be better off in a facility where they could work on her mental health than in jail though she did wreak havoc on the lives of the men she accused.

@MasterOfBaiter,The whole amber/Depp case was one serious L I had to take at the time. I had a rough childhood with an abusive mom and I only heard that one tape of her smashing doors a screaming at Depp and it immidiately registered in my mind as the same behaviors I had to deal with from my mom and my brain just didn't seek any more confirmation after that and honestly I also didn't care about two rich fucks struggling so didn't look more into it. Everything I have learned since tho about the case and how that first judgment of mine was premature kinda revealed some wounds I still have to work on at the very least. I can only assume many other men saw those tapes too cause they were circulated far more than the shit Depp did and were triggered by them as well into making that type of rapid judgment.,2,2024-10-17T07:46:47Z,2024-10-17T07:46:47Z
@harenmelan,"I will admit, I didn't pay a lot of attention and considered it possible she did some unpleasnat things towards Depp, BUT... always the bits I saw, made it feel like he was more definitely abusive.

@Sintra4,"I took a couple days to process and re-process the subject of this video so that I can explain things properly. I hope what I'm about to say makes sense. My perspective is that of a man who was emotionally and physically abused by a woman when he was a child. I'll just be honest right up top that, despite that, I empathized with Heard's perspective much, much more than I did Depp's.

Pretty much right from the beginning of that whole episode, something felt ""off"" to me about the people claiming to defend Depp from Heard's ""abuse."" It didn't take much research to debunk a lot of the more popular claims that were made against her, but after dozens of arguments with people on Twiiter during that time, it was clear that people had already made their minds up long before they felt they had anything concrete to back their opinions. Despite the ""man abused by woman"" narrative, I didn't really find myself feeling much kinship with Depp. I understand that PTSD can make you do and say some pretty horrible things, but the sense that I got from Depp's behavior was that of a manipulative abuser who was entirely aware of the power and influence he had over Heard and popular media in general. With Heard, there were a number of details to the arguments and fights that reminded me pretty strongly of how I reacted to my own mother's abuse of me as a child, up to and including a lot of her behaviors that people took as being abusive. I hope it goes without saying that children are pretty incapable of abusing their parents. Despite this, that's how my mother processed a lot of my reactions to how she treated me, so I was already very familiar with the tendency of abusive people failing to recognize the actual cause of their ""loved one's"" anger and resentment toward them.

I think F.D did a great job explaining the reactive process of responding to traumatic events and triggers that's extremely common (maybe universal?) among people with PTSD. The way I like to describe is akin to a snake putting on a threat display. Specifically, Hognose Snakes will fan out the scales around their neck to resemble a cobra, curl up their tails to resemble a rattlesnake, and make a gigantic fuss when they don't want you around them. A ""hissy fit,"" if you will. It can be pretty intimidating if you don't know what the behavior's really about, but the objective reality of the situation is that you literally could not be in less danger than you are in the presence of an angry Hognose Snake. When they bluff strike you, they don't even open their mouths. They just bonk you with their silly little nose. They don't actually want to hurt you; they just want you to go away so they can feel safe. I think that this can be helpful for understanding a lot of seemingly scary behavior from traumatized individuals. To be clear, human beings can and do use direct physical violence out of fear, so it's not a perfect metaphor, but I think the value is in understanding the motivations behind someone like Heard being so confrontational and even aggressive with someone like Depp in a lot of the stories that weren't fabricated or divorced from context.

When I first watched this video 2 days ago, I intended on putting out a comment about how ""alone"" I felt, trying to argue, educate and defend my perspective among people who didn't even have a basic foundation of trauma and abuse to go off of. I realize now that that sort of thing kind of goes without saying to the people who are even capable of understanding it, and meaningless to those who aren't, hence why I decided to base the bulk of this comment around education, rather than grievance. I do appreciate the people coming out and talking about this now, as the discussion was incredibly toxic and genuinely upsetting to me at the time. I still feel a small tinge of resentment at all the people I otherwise respected, including several people that I knew personally, either stay completely silent on this or just uncritically buy into Depp's narrative. One statement I heard from many different people was ""I know an abuser when I see one,"" which was always followed with accusing the latest cultural punching bag for misogynists of manipulation and abuse, often with the additional step of hurling slurs, insults and unsubstantiated rumors about her.

I'm mostly past the worst feelings, but there were a lot of people who really shook my trust in them at the time, and I'm not sure if I'd be capable of forgiving them, even the sincerest and most accountability-driven apology I'd ever hear. This is for the people who bought into the narrative. For the people that stayed silent back then, I think I'm past the resentment, especially of people who openly acknowledge that choosing to stay silent and/or unaware was a mistake.

I hope that this comment was in any way informative for people. I also hope I didn't come across as co-opting a feminist issue for my own concerns. I feel that the connection between misogyny and ableism were really strong in this case, and I hope that I explained my reasons for thinking that well enough. My hope is that we can have an open, public discussion about these issues someday.",3,2024-10-17T05:41:03Z,2024-10-17T05:41:03Z

@ItsLexy,"All I really needed to know was Depp has a history of pursuing intimate partners with whom he has significant age gap.  He dated a BARELY legal teen Winona while in his mid 20s.  Kate Moss was more than a decade younger than him, he dated her in her 20s while he was in his 30s.  Same with his baby mama.  He was closer in age to Amber's father than he was to her!  Look at how old she is NOW; she's 38 and he's 61, do the math there and check the dates they started dating.  His new girlfriend, the Russian model, won't have her 30th birthday for another year or two!  He's demonstrably a nasty old man and clearly knows enough to keep things on the legal side while still pursuing partners who are more likely to be more na√Øve than him, less established in the industry than him, less wealthy than him, more obscure to the general public than him which makes it easier for their reputations and perception by the masses to be destroyed than his own.  That's not by accident.  Move like a predator and I think of you accordingly.

Amber might also be a trash human being, but that doesn't preclude that she could be preyed on and abused by someone more powerful.  As for all the people willing to say ""she lied"" or the most horse hockey take ""the body language expert said she was faking her tears, she was acting"", well they BOTH lied about them dogs going into Australia.  Depp has been quoted as saying ""I'm not an actor. I lie for a living"".  I wouldn't be so quick to assume Amber lying equalled Depp being truthful.",4,2024-10-16T22:06:22Z,2024-10-16T22:06:22Z

@kyletucker3811,"12:18 Not entirely through the video yet, but you've already significantly changed my perspective on the situation, so thank you. Had to watch this on 2x speed just to rip the bandaid off because I've had a pretty strong stance (though I don't go out of my way to vocalize it) against Amber Heard for a number of years now. As a victim of abuse (basically every kind but sexual) as a kid, I have a rather harsh view of people who fabricate abuse. Because it makes the situation worse for those who have been victims. So when the narrative came out and seemed to check out that she wasn't actually a victim, I regretably took my side not really against her, but more in the idea she wasn't actually a victim.

Glad I gave this video a shot. Still doesnt change the fact I'll probably watch both of their movies. I've come to accept that about 80-90% of celebrities are terrible people and to a certain extent you can acknowledge that yet still enjoy their works.

Lt Dan, the old man who refused to evacuate for the hurricane and has a criminal record including rape and assault now has a go fund me full of money from women who only want him to be safe and well.

I tried to caution others not to throw enthusiastic support behind Depp as the truth could be complicated and nobody really knows but them and God and who even knows if he's real. That didn't stop most people online from backing Depp for some reason, I guess because people liked him in a movie (makes no sense to me) or they were looking at this as some sort of battle for men's rights or antiwoke or something, who knows.

@modernisto,"I have no doubt Johnny Depp is problematic. Alcoholism is a serious and chronic disease glorified and profited by multiple industries. I don‚Äôt doubt he was abusive in some fashion. 

But isn‚Äôt it kind of clickbait to just write abuser on your video without providing any substantial evidence? You also seem to be making pretty broad allegations of men in general. Everyone is a victim minus white men? 

What did he get away with? Depp had his Hollywood career disappeared by these allegations. Not sure how much more canceled can a person get. 

Again, you shed no light or real evidence. All you did was claim you researched the trial and found Dep to be less credible. You bring up one allegation/instance of a lacerated finger and subsequent drunken tantrum. 

Look I‚Äôm no Red-piller. Matter of fact I‚Äôm quite progressive in most issues. But you seem to be simply choosing a side and deeming one side as abusive and the other as a imperfect victim. I‚Äôm no fan of Elon Musk but casting her as imperfect because of associating with him is flimsy. Should we paint Grimes by the same brush? Bad taste in men is pretty common and wealthy men get significantly more ‚Äúattention‚Äù than their less fortunate brethren. 

Why does there have to be one abuser and one victim? Sure this case brought out the collective manosphere to dog pile on Heard. I agree it was very one sided in that sense. Seeing two toxic peoples dysfunctional relationship and trial broadcasted across media is sad and part of our culture. I just don‚Äôt see the benefit of distilling this case into near black and white terms.

Some of those recordings on the night of the missing finger incident that were inadmissible because Jerry Judge was in it (who had passed before he could be depositioned I believe) really changed the way I looked at it tbh.

I just found some of the shit she said to align itself more with my sperm donor and his family in particular.

@LuLu98J,"I had the luck to be following Leeja Miller's content on YouTube at the time of the Depp v. Heard media circus. I wasn't really interested in the specifics of the case, but I couldn't escape the multiple suggestions of videos about it on YouTube, and the titles, thumbnails and general common sense perspective of those videos already bothered me ‚Äî without me knowing the details of the cases. The fact that theses celebrities' civil trial was recieving so much scrutiny made me want to not be part of it. And the good cool crazy guy vs the manipulative bimbo villain kind of narrative that seemed to be pushed on the viral mediatization of the trial reeeaaally bothered me, because I knew that even if some of the things that Heard was being accused of seemed pretty shocking, I knew I didn't know enough about the case and I knew that usually abuse situations are not what they superficially seem to be. But when I saw Leeja Miller's video about it, with her perspective as a survivor of abuse and as a lawyer who studied the characteristics of abuse, it all made sense to me. She talks about the imperfect victims, she talks about the reactive victims, she talks about the power imbalance that is an essencial part of an abusive relationship and how there's always an abuser who controls the violence of a relationship and, in some cases, even instigates violence from their victim to manipulate the situation in their own favor. She posted the video with important information and studies to back it up, showing how Amber was an imperfect victim who was being villainized. And she did so in a moment the anti-Heard pro-Depp discourse granted growth in subscribers and raising profits, especially when your videos were more and more sensationalized. She posted the videos with a closed comment section, as she explained she didn't want that video to result in a space for angry victim blaming discourse or for herself to be scrutinized (which I think was a wonderful choice, because it made the viewers not instantly respond desperately with their pre-conceived ""opinions"", but to sit with the information and maybe reflect upon it ‚Äî and, trust me, she would've gotten much more views and money had she left the comment section open for polarized debate). She didn't defend Heard, she defended all reactive and imperfect victims whose voices were being silenced by a loud crowd of a very profitable viral perspective of ""mutual abuse"" that messed with peoples emotions. I was really lucky to have come upon Leeja's video, because from all the chaos of the Depp v. Heard, at least, I learned more about the specifics of abuse and about the complexity of abusive relationships. And her video instructed me to know how to respond to ""mutual abuse"" claims. I just wish that the ""progressive"" side of youtube who took part of the anti-Heard discourse would look back into what they disseminated and be self-critical in order to reevaluate their public position about this case and, as a consequence, of similar cases.",1,2024-10-16T16:27:50Z,2024-10-16T16:27:50Z

@notoriousd.i.g.87,"I'm not gonna sit here and glaze Johnny, cause I will say he did some messed up stuff. My thing is Amber was shown to have lied about much of her claims or made specific allegations that should have some substantial evidence for it. Like the private jet incident. I have no doubt in my mind that Johnny confronted her about perceived cheating, he said some super gross stuff to her, he got super drunk, and locked himself in the bathroom. But if Johnny threw stuff at you, booted you in the back, and did all this physical violence, there should be more evidence of it than a recording of Johnny mumbling while drunk that you can barely hear. There were other people on the plane, at least a flight attendant, who would have witnessed it. Were there no video cameras on the plane? No one recorded this happening on their phone? These are very specific allegations that should have some corroborating evidence. I do see a cycle of recording Depp at low points for humiliation purposes. Claiming she used makeup that wasn't out yet to cover bruises that based on next day pictures aren't present. Even if makeup was used to cover the injuries, the type of injuries described would still very identifiable with makeup on, especially during full recordings where there is more time to look for and identify those injuries. These lies combined with from what I see as expressly malicious behavior towards Depp lead me towards the mutual abuse idea. It screams that her claims are exaggerated at best or outright false at worst.

Additionally, abusers have histories of abuse. They don't just become abusive for one partner and are fine before and after. Johnny had his drug/alcohol problems before, during, and I'd wager after Amber. Yet his former and current partners have all stated that they weren't/aren't abused. Meanwhile, Amber does have a history of being abusive in relationships before and after Depp. 

Maybe evidence did exist but her legal defense was terrible and just didn't get it, as that was also clear in this case. But when I see the totality of the case, I don't see someone hitting 10 times and someone hitting back once and then getting backlash. It screams they were swinging on each other.",9,2024-10-16T15:39:53Z,2024-10-16T15:39:53Z

i think i just didn't know, as it's not my lived situation, so i wasn't going to speak on it. this may've been why i just stopped investing in celebrities. they just perpetuate issues of abuse on the worldwide stage, leading smoother brains to either mimic or apologise for abuse, regardless who enacts it.",1,2024-10-16T15:31:14Z,2024-10-16T15:31:14Z

@Linathehuman,"A few things about Amber dating Elon. 

1) It was in 2016 before even the 2018 'pedo guy' stuff. Yes he was a billionaire, but he was portraying the image of an LGBT friendly Liberal. Amber is a Liberal. At the time this wasn't her going out of her way to date Trump supporting, trans daughter hating maniac... dating a billionaire is still not a vibe but it's worth pointing out. 

2) Amber was super vulnurable after her relationship with Depp. If you look at pictures of her she's underweight & looks like a teenager. She was living in one of Depp's apartments still because she couldn't afford to move out (he financially abused her while they were dating a LOT & even took her car off her,) and he had just violently attacked her multiple times, and wouldn't agree to stay away from her. He kept just walking into her house because the security was employed by him and noone would stand up to him. It was when she was in this state (full PTSD,  enduring post separation abuse from Depp) that Elon stepped in and offered her a full security detail. She wasn't really in a position to say no. 

3)  It came out that Elon Musk was also surveilling and stalking her straight after she got out of the relationship with Depp. (Tortoise did some original reporting in the podcast Elon's Spies where he admits to as much.)

4)  Musk leaked an intimate picture of her to the world this year... after she'd been to congress trying to get revenge porn laws signed into place after her nudes were leaked.  

She was love bombed & taken advantage of when she was the most vulnerable she'd ever been, & then was abused by another much older, richer, more influential man who abused their power imbalance. So like... yes it wasn't a great decision but I can see how she got into that situation.

She was close with Eve Barlow during the trial though which is what she should be criticized for.",2,2024-10-16T15:16:28Z,2024-10-16T16:04:33Z

I recommend this video https://youtu.be/ORdP71jJRyc?si=FrEamC5SXfl8i9vt since although outdated it is very informative to see both sides of the case and is unbiased allowing you to form your own opinion. Although nothing takes away from how the court case has unjustly impacted Heard's own life. I know there isn't any point in direct address since you won't be seeing this, but this is still probably your worst video in my opinion, it just feels too one-sided and a lot of context and important information is left out.

I've been that person running from room to room from the person I loved, and having that person not leave me alone. Hate campaign towards Heard is stupid and unfair, but there's no comparison between Anita Hill and Amber Heard's situations. I don't see the reaction against Heard as an overcorrection for MeToo. The problem that some victims have with Heard is that her baseless accusations harm victims so that we continue not to be believed, she is using and abusing MeToo. If Depp raped her with a broken bottle and she ran from him on broken glass, where are her injuries, where is the blood?

@VenusMacabre,"There's also the fact that Amber Heard is bisexual and that played a huge role in her vilification.

Bisexual women in relationships with men are at an alarmingly exacerbated risk of intimate partner violence and sexual violence, and Depp's abuse of her absolutely indulged in biphobic/homophobic impulses.

He isolated her from her LGBT friends, in particular her lesbian and female bisexual friends, was transphobic towards a trans male friend of hers repeatedly, and then her bisexuality was used as ""proof"" of her untrustworthiness, because bisexuals are still seen as greedy liars who can't be faithful, let alone honest.

Megan Thee Stallion, Evan Rachel Wood, Angelina Jolie and Amber Heard are all bisexual women who suffered abuse and violence at the hands of a man they were close to and were subsequently vilified for it to hell and back.",1,2024-10-16T09:48:43Z,2024-10-16T18:05:33Z

@mdstevens0612,"Being on Twitter in the thick of it, it really was hard to form an opinion on it. Right wing outlets were literally running a misinformation campaign and they were laughing their way to the bank from harvesting clicks. At the same time, Heard's defense was blundering, and then that voice recording came out where Heard admitted that she hit Depp. That's when even a lot of popular figures turned on her. Like, popular left leaning anituber Mother's Basement also made a long thread apologizing for supporting Amber Heard and that he was now supporting Depp. And all the while none of it sat right with me. I bowed out, I didn't have enough information to feel comfortable saying anything one way or another.

Then Depp lost the defamation case.

This was the one that moved the needle for me by a lot. He dragged both their American asses to the UK where defamation cases are typically easier to lose, Heard's defense was very lacking and still, Depp lost that case.

And those facts just didn't sway anyone. In their minds, they had heard the recording, decided that Heard was the bad guy, refused to interrogate further.

It was all messy, and litigating who shit on the bed is exhausting, but at the end of the day... Depp couldn't prove she was lying with the deck stacked in his favour. While I am still open to the idea that Heard had been abusive, that these were two individuals who brought out the worst in each other and became violent... With the benefit of hindsight and all things considered, Amber Heard did not get a fair shake, and as of time of writing, I don't believe she was the main instigator or perpetrator of abuse, that it was either reactive or at a much smaller scale than Depp's abuse.",0,2024-10-16T08:40:46Z,2024-10-16T08:40:46Z
@idde4345,"Having had more time to think about this video, sorry, but this is pretty performative. You always have amazing videos. But this all makes it sound like you're more interested in placating the 'progressives' who complained about Heard being in a screengrab. The same people who are unwilling to see a woman as an abuser and a man as a victim. 

I was sick when the trial was going on. This was an extremely unique case, so I watched all of it. When Heard presented two pictures into evidence that were *exactly* the same, aside from saturation and turned up lighting, claiming they were different, it became clear she was a liar. When she claimed she walked around with bruises, when two different make up artists who did her make up for talk shows who saw her up close in the surrounding days claim they saw no bruising whatsoever, it became clear she was a liar. When she went into detail of *horrific* SA, including walking over broken glass, but she did not seek medical attention, and did not show any scarring or cuts on her feet when she was practicing for her movie the Danish Girl, it became apparent she was a liar. When she went into full detail about how Depp demolished a trailer they were staying at on a campsite, and the verified campsite owner testified there was no damage there, aside from a flickering lightbulb, it became clear she was a liar. 

There is a rather large amount of irony in talking about misinformation, when you're reaching the conclusion Heard is an 'imperfect victim', when the grounds for that are people taking everything she says at face value. When all the disproven claims she made should indicate nothing she says should be taken at face value.

The shit on the bed unlikely belonging to Heard and all the very real  problems way too many women have to deal with way too often are *not* applicable reasons to come to the conclusion that Amber Heard was the 'imperfect victim' here. Not when she has herself admitted that she starts fights, hoping he would stay to fight with her. And she blames him for leaving. Which makes total sense if you have a fear of abandonment, and you want people to prove their love by staying with you. It still makes you an abuser. Heard is not an 'imperfect victim' when she has admitted to physically assaulting him. And saying 'I wasn't punching you, I was hitting you.'

You are right that people lashing out after suffering abuse does not make you an abuser on the same level as the people initiating. After having a whole court of law to prove that Depp physically abused her just once, the worst she came up with was video of him slamming cabinet doors and getting mad (which she set up, and sent to DMZ, as testified by a DMZ employee) and disproven and increasingly exaggerated stories. And texts from Depp that were absolutely gross and horrifying, but in response to years and years of abuse, and her publicly accusing him of abuse destroying his reputation. Does 'imperfect victim' sound appropriate here?

Honestly, usually being a fan of your videos, it's pretty disappointing that you reach the conclusion you did, that you're so easily painting a victim of abuse as an abuser, without doing the proper amount of research *yourself*, when all the information you need is visible in detail in the trial, and comprehensively in summaries.

Speaking broader on the subject, it's hugely disappointing that the 'progressive' part of YouTube is more interested in circling the wagons than facing up to the fact that women can be abusers to. And in stead of saying *all* victims should be able to come forward and have their stories heard, and abusers should face consequences for their actions (which would be the right thing to do, both morally and progressively), the abuse a man faced gets denied entirely. Even when it was presented as clearly and publicly, with a infamously difficult to prove won case of defamation to back it up.

I'm not gonna say: 'men have it so difficult', because men have to deal with a lot less crap than women. But if progressive spaces can't accept the fact Depp, a man, was the victim, and Heard, a woman was the abuser, that does say a lot about what male victims of abuse have to deal with. And how ill equipped the 'progressive left' is in dealing with it.",4,2024-10-16T08:34:58Z,2024-10-16T08:36:45Z

Also, more relevantly because he does have wealth and power is that there are many women who have been in relationships with him who could easily me too the hell out of him. Kate Moss and Winona Ryder come to mine. Once an abuser always an abuser. Amber Heards previous behaviour with her friends and family (who had less power than her) is also relevant. As is the simple fact that there are a few men (probably far less in hollywood but i imagine not an insignificant number) who have it engrained into them to never hit a woman. The power and profile of previous previous partners seem the strongest arguments but there is also the recordings and the way she treats others, especially family and friends. At the time when he was with the high profile women it was pre me too. Amber Heard used the genuine suffering of real victims to cash in. R u seriously saying that some of his previous partners, top tier (like the victims of Weinstein) would not have jumped on board.

I remember being scared of her when I was real little when she was in one of her pissy moods and dad wasn't around. I believe she's narcissistic schizophrenic. Anyway, suffering through her shit for so long, when I got older I started to fire back at her verbally. Sometimes would destroy something of her's in retaliation. So I totally understand Amber shooting back at Depp and his abusive shit, so to speak. Because my mother didn't physically abuse me it took a very long time for me to fully admit to myself that what I dealt with is just a valid as someone who was physically abused.

@ErinMagner82,"For me, Amber Heard snorting drugs directly in front of the judge (who is female) and laughing when the judge confronted her about it was what I needed to know about their relative characters to see Johnny Depp as the victim here despite his chronic substance abuse.  His past partners not only have made defenses of his character in relationships, but have gone so far as to give him virtues as a partner compared to others.  There was an age difference and a money motivation for Amber Heard, combined with some type of personality disorder that turned the relationship toxic, and when Johnny Depp left the abuse behind she pursued him to continue to try and victimize him as well as extort money from someone that foolishly cared about someone that was only beautiful on the outside.",1,2024-10-16T02:49:44Z,2024-10-16T02:49:44Z
@glousy8300,"I am 100% with you on the hate campaign and general social reaction.  You lost me a bit on the initial argument of a clear abuser/ abused relationship in this case.  You correctly identify many repeated details that are in fact questionable at best, but you only offer one example for your entire argument (the insults written in blood).  It had me thinking but then you didn't give me anything else to go on.
      I didn't follow the case very close.  The audio of some of their fights honestly left me unable to condemn or condone one partner above the other.  If that was an incorrect impression......  convince me more.  ""Abuser"" and ""Abused"" is extreme language these days.  Justifiably, as the nature of abuse can warrant it, but we must respect it's power.  The language warrants more than one example.   
       All opposing binary categories can be problematic and dangerous.  In this case the categories are ""abused"" and ""abuser"" and the associated danger is the weaponization of these terms, resulting in dehumanization and ignorance on both sides of the dichotomy.   
     It is always more accurate to humanize the whole affair, even as it is emotionally challenging to do so.",0,2024-10-16T02:48:59Z,2024-10-16T02:48:59Z

@dmc4426,"Amber Heard was arrested for hitting the woman she dated before Depp. Amber was charged with Domestic Violence. But her girlfriend dropped the charges. She hit her girlfriend Taysa in front of a cop named Beverly Leonard. When asked about this during the trial Amber tried to play it off that it never happened and the cop was a misogynistic man who didn't like 2 women dating so he was harassing them. But in truth the cop, Beverly Leonard, was a female lesbian. So just another of Amber's lies. Amber's former friend Raquel Pennington said Amber hit her while they were grocery shopping. Her former personal assistant said Amber spit on her. There is a video from a r ality TV show that Amber's sister Whitney was on. In an episode Whitney has marks from being hit. One of the other women asked if it was true her sister Amber had hit her. Whitney didn't deny Amber hitting her then. She said ""we're not going to talk about that."" Though later she denied Amber hitting her. As a teen Amber had her drives license suspended right after getting it. It was suspended for 5 years in Texas. Amber talked about her friend dying in a car crash in high school. As she was a minor the record is sealed. But there is speculation she was the one driving the car that her high school friend died in and that's why she lost her license for 5 years. She caused the crash. The mug shot is available online.     Amber almost cut Depp's finger off with a broken bottle. There is on YouTube audio from that night when Depp went to the hospital. The doctor is trying to talk to Depp and Amber is crying saying Johnny I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it. The doctor has to tell the nurse to get Amber something to calm her down. The doctor tell the nurse what drug to give her. Depp is literally bleeding and his finger is half off and the doctor can't care for him because he had to deal with Amber. As a woman who has suffered abuse, I stand with victims. Depp is the victim in this case.",2,2024-10-16T02:06:24Z,2024-10-16T02:06:24Z
@MirelaMusicUK,"Couldn't agree more with you!!
Thank you for also recommending the other creators who've covered this topic, I'll definitely be watching their videos!

I occasionally think about this trial and how fucked up everything was. You covered so much of what I've been thinking, as well as things I'd not considered before, but actually the main thing that's been on my mind since the trial that I've not seen anyone talk about is how fucking performative it all was, and how people ate it up!
As everything was unfolding, so many videos from the case would pop up on my socials, which I'd watch, and then read other people's comments, and I'd usually be so frustrated by it all! The way that Depp and his legal team would play up to the cameras like they were in some sort of movie, and the fact that people treated them like characters, with a ""good guys"" vs ""bad guys"" narrative. 
Considering how adverse the internet is to cringe, I truly don't know how people didn't see right through it!
But the way that so many people celebrated his win, as if they'd personally been the victims of this evil, one-dimensional, cartoon movie villain...
And look, I'm with you on this because I'd never even heard of Amber Herd before any of this, and honestly don't particularly like her either based on what I now know. But how could people see what was going on (even with the false narratives being spread) and not hold Depp just as, if not more accountable when so many people called it ""mutually abusive"" but then never seemed to acknowledge or criticise Depp's part, but actually put him on a pedestal of innocence? I mean you explained why in your video but the answer is more frustrating to know.
But I also think it's also the simple and obvious answer that Johnny Depp is a beloved A-list actor that a lot of people (including myself) grew up watching. His performances and persona, and the fact that he's attractive ofc, means he's just a quirky goofball, and his toxic actions can be justified because he was either just fighting back or was on drugs but that's ok because he's basically a rock star and that's what they're like.

I'm not sure if I've ever commented on your videos before but I just wanna say that I appreciate how eloquent, rational and critical your takes are! Honestly I always question myself if I 100% agree with somebody on all their opinions because I don't want to be caught in a chamber where everything I already think/believe is echoed back to me.
I'm mentioning this because of how much you had to over-explain your position, knowing how certain people will have knee-jerk responses due to their own pre-existing biases, and won't even consider what you have to say because they've already made their minds up. Those are the same people who'd already made their minds up about the trial, and you're right in saying that no matter what evidence or facts are presented to them, nothing could change their minds. I'm grateful that content creators like you still speak up about this stuff! Sorry for the essay, I've had so much to say about this but I don't have the same kind of platform to speak on it and because of that even sharing my own thoughts on it publicly makes me nervous üôÉ",4,2024-10-16T01:47:04Z,2024-10-16T01:47:04Z

@haute03,"Okay, so I posted a pretty benign comment that seems to have gotten ""lost,"" so I'm going to drop it here again because I'm curious to see if this one sticks or if you are deleting comments (as a long-time viewer, I truly hope that is not the case).

This video is honestly a pretty disappointing take on a very complex topic. I've noticed that content creators who speak on this subject and are still sympathetic to Heard have not watched the trial--or, more specifically, watched Heard's testimony--and are getting their information from video essays, tabloid articles, online forums, etc. which tend to be inaccurate and, unfortunately, this video is no different. Before I respond to your question about Depp, I'd like to correct a few inaccuracies. (1) The news about the feces incident broke in 2020 during the UK trial when Hilda Vargas (Depp-Heard's former housekeeper) testified that she saw the feces in the bed, freaked out, and texted Depp's team about it, including a photo of said feces (Google at your own risk) in her message. She also stated that she had been cleaning up after their dogs (who were three-pound miniature Yorkies) for years and that it was clear the feces had not come from them. (2) IIRC at no point during the VA trial did Depp say that he tried to get a friend to defecate in front of Heard's room. I'm really curious to know where you read that. (3) There's a recording Heard took where she admits to causing Depp's finger injury (albeit she claimed it was an accident). I believe that audio is still available right here on YouTube. However, it was not entered into evidence because it has the voice of Depp's deceased bodyguard on it and was therefore labeled as hearsay and considered inadmissible evidence.¬†

Listen, I'm a Black woman who 100% believed Heard and was vocal of my support online. I stopped supporting her after watching¬†her testify. I was even in the courtroom for part of her testimony. I was there when they brought out the bowie knife that Heard gifted to Depp with the words ""hasta la muerte"" inscribed on it for the jury to see. I heard with my own ears the audio that played over the gallery loudspeakers. One particular bit of audio that remains fresh in my mind is when Depp recalls an incident where he fled to a bathroom in their home and locked the door to get away from Heard¬†(which he stated he often did when their verbal flights escalated or went on for hours). It was on that audio that Heard admitted to punching Depp in the face when he finally did open the door. I also remember reading the article about Heard's DV arrest after it was entered into evidence and saw the¬†photos that she claimed were taken shortly after a violent incident¬†only¬†to see that none of the injuries she described (black eyes, split lip, bruised back, etc.) were present on her person. I could honestly go on and on about the evidence presented in this case and how it shaped my opinion, but let me (finally) get to the point.

Amber Heard is an abuser and it honestly feels like those of us who watched the¬†trial are being gaslit by this type of content. I get that it's incredibly strange to think that that's the case since we're talking about a woman who claimed to be the victim of a male megastar; the reality runs counter to so many stories we've heard and seen play out when it comes to abuse in Hollywood and DV/IPV situations in general. It's also extremely frightening and painful to think about someone lying about horrific abuse, even going as far to retell her former assistant's SA story as her own while on the stand (see: Kate James's second declaration in the UK trial). However, that's the case.

I implore whoever is reading this to stop looking at video essays, reading posts on online forums, or even reading through YouTube comments like this one. Do your research and leverage credible sources. Watch the live streams of the trial, read through the court documents, look at the exhibits, *then* form your opinion.",7,2024-10-15T22:54:21Z,2024-10-15T22:54:21Z
@NotUrBot,"If it's all misogyny, why did everyone believe Rhianna and no one once asked her what she did that brought it on and what was her part in bringing it on herself?
And this is just one example. There are so many more. 
I feel this swing from protect all men, hide the evidence to believe all women without due diligence is just as harmful. I know 2 established men from my country who committed s****** because one's nude tapes were released and the other was falsely accused, something the girl publicly admitted later and thr was no punishment for both these women. It's a dangerous slope, a sign of wanting revenge and unhealed trauma for all the horrid atrocities women have endured through the centuries at the hands of patriarchy. It needs healing and recognition but flipping the whole situation  is only going to create more pain and more trauma. It's easy to have moral indignation, rage and absolutes as keyboard warriors.

I'm a white woman who grew up in a pretty culty, pretty racist religious environment, and unsurprisingly, I'm also a survivor of abuse at the hands of a white man.

The Amber Heard situation really drove home to me that even a lot of self-described leftists wouldn‚Äôt believe or support me because I'm a white woman who used to be a somewhat shitty kid, and the one-two punch of ""ugh white women"" and ""your high-school mascot was WHAT?!"" is real.

I thought I was just an asshole, but after therapy and a lot of healing I learned I was doing a behavior called reactive abuse that many victims end up doing in survival mode. I reacted to my own verbal, physical, sexual, and financial abuse by verbally abusing my ex. It fed into his gaslighting me that I deserved his abuse. Long story short (too late) I got out, got help, got healthy, and have never acted that way again. Used to be ashamed but no more!",0,2024-10-15T20:58:31Z,2024-10-15T20:58:31Z

We're seen as inherently sexual by people who believe it's a fetish we're indulging (and not an identity), which means our public presentation as anything but our assigned gender is seen as a sexual act. So they view us as innately predatory and sex-obsessed (always doing fetish stuff 24/7, in public, in their eyes), so rumors are easily started + circulated.

Add the existence of the Trans Panic Defense (legal argument that a person is justified in attacking a trans person because their transness was not revealed before sex / flirting / whatever) and communities like KiwiFarms and certain 4chan groups that are dedicated to crafting attacks against public figures in our community (many of these attacks coming in the form of fabricated accusations and slander to destroy reputations), and it's a constant threat looming over the head of any trans person who becomes publicly known, even if they keep all of their sexual activity intensely secret and private (because again, these people see our existence + identity as intrinsically sexual).",0,2024-10-15T19:38:03Z,2024-10-15T19:38:03Z

That's it. That's what he was suing over -- that this single line destroyed his reputation to the point where he lost roles and destroyed his reputation.

I still do not believe her because she doesnt say what actually happened, she says completely different things. To me this was the only indicator, not her being unhinged, both were unhinged, its that she either lied to the lawyers before the trial or lied during the trial because she gave 2 different realities from her pov",1,2024-10-15T17:42:25Z,2024-10-15T17:42:25Z
@CrossbowEnthusiast,"I was in high school when the Heard-Depp case was going. At that point I was becoming more progressive but still shedding my anti-woke mindset from being a dumb little shit. I still browsed r/pussypassdenied and watched those two black guys from Quebec (i think) who were MRA. I paid attention to the case because on Reddit it was framed as a male abuse victim fighting his oppressor, and as someone who had been through the ringer before it really spoke to me. Now, years later I'm seeing the discourse around this change just as I have. I am someone who does consider myself progressive and all that, and yet it's difficult to hear and confront the reality of this case knowing how willingly I believed in it. I can say that the onus wasn't on me because I was young and misinformed and only ever commented on Reddit, but I know I should've been more skeptical and critical as I am now. It's taken me time to learn that lesson but there is so much in our pasts that we leave untouched once we move on. It's important to confront our pasts and ourselves to ensure that we are not making the same mistakes we once did. I know better now, and even as such it's difficult to reconcile that with what I believed to know. Learning takes time and I appreciate you gave enough grace to those who followed the case and supported Depp to know that they weren't all women-haters (although I was far closer than I like to admit) because this case did mean a lot of things to a lot of people.

@sennnia,"Right off the jump, whenever I hear amber heard I tense up because I don't know what the person talking about her is about to say. As a victim of domestic violence whose abuser attempted to paint as the aggressor, this whole thing messed me up because it happened right as I was leaving my monster. It was, among other reasons, proof that it would not benefit me to report because I would not be believed. Because I might not have been as messy as the ""evidence"" presented on Amber, but I wasn't a perfect victim either. There were moments I acted or reacted based on what was happening to me that, depending on who was telling the story and who was deemed credible, would not have made me look good.

@allieSunl,"Regarding Johnny Depp: As a white, Millennial, woman I can break this down for you really quick. Depp is like every white girl‚Äôs favorite actor at some point given his many iconic roles like Edward Scissorhands or Pirates of the Caribbean. He‚Äôs one of the most well-known actors in white Hollywood and has been for four decades. It‚Äôs ignored that he dated Winona Ryder when she was a minor. And so, when Amber Heard called him out for being abusive, that didn‚Äôt mesh with the white girl mythology of who he is as a person. He‚Äôs always come off as mysterious, quirky, extremely handsome, and incredibly cool. Realizing he‚Äôs also an abuser is a hard pill to swallow and it‚Äôs easier to defend him than to recognize he abused a romantic partner. People heard she defecated on his bed and that was all they needed to know. It‚Äôs truly a shame more people cant stop idolizing abusers.",1,2024-10-15T17:12:56Z,2024-10-15T17:17:29Z

@SkylerRoy,"One thing I think is important to mention is that even if people accept the 'mutual abuse' narrative, that still doesn't mean they view both parties are equally bad. I got into an argument with a friend and their partner over this, and it was astounding to hear someone say 'Johnny Depp is an abusive piece of shit, but Amber Heard is so much worse'. This is *just* a hunch, but it feels like people are so scared of the idea of the quote-on-quote ""narcissist"" that the entirely speculative idea that someone has allegedly manipulated the entire situation to come out looking innocent is a greater evil than domestic abuse.",1,2024-10-15T17:05:59Z,2024-10-15T17:05:59Z
@davidjairala69,"[redacted] ""Google the pictures"" bruh if you think that's what it looks like to write in blood I have a bridge to sell you. 

Also, it should definitely be noted that Heard's history of domestic violence includes being arrested for hitting her girlfriend in front of security at the airport. All I could find on Depp is that he threw a wine bottle at the ground once, in the context of a relationship which his partner did describe as ""controlling"" and ""jealous"". And you could definitely say something about the Depp+Ryder situation. Besides that, there's really not much on the dude.

It also should be noted that Heard has said several demonstrably false things about Depp, which is consistent with her personality disorder, as are the observed patterns of abuse, manipulation, and control. 

I think the best way we can look at this is as a story of two deeply unhealthy people bringing out the worst in each other. Did he abuse her in some capacity? I'm sure. And he's responsible for his own behavior.  But, gut check says she dragged him down to her level more than the other way around, just based on their publicly available personal histories.",3,2024-10-15T17:05:38Z,2024-10-15T17:26:57Z

If everything had happened as she described  in Australia for example she wouldn't be able to leave the hospital for weeks, if not months. Human body is fragile. If what she said was true she would have suffered a severe concussion and most likely a skull fracture. I'm not even talking about cuts from the glass and just general blood loss and other fractures.
It is impossible to be at the airport the next day or so without any signs of violence after what she described. No cuts, no bruises. It's physically impossible.
So no, the problem is not that she is not a perfect victim. The problem is that what she testified was physically impossible.

Abuse changes people and a victim shouldn't have to do absolutely everything perfectly for you to believe them.) It wasn't until I took a step back and saw that many people supporting Depp were, at worst, misogynistic who didn't believe women's claims of abuse no matter what, or they excused or overlooked Depp's glaring faults. Looking back on it two years later, I'm honestly shocked and ashamed at my past behavior, because this was long after I'd started calling myself ""left wing"" and told myself I was above parasocial relationships.

She was her own worst enemy. If you say you were beaten and stamped on before an event then go to that event in a backless, sleeveless dress without a single mark on your body expect to be disbelieved. Anyone who has been beaten up or knows a victim of domestic abuse will tell you there is a limit to how much makeup can cover up. Mel B's abuse was seen by the makeup woman on a program she did. Amber claims she did her own makeup, which is bullshit. Studio makeup is different than daily makeup, for lighting and filming reasons especially for movie filming. If Amber had sustained the injuries as claimed before filming it would have been seen. But what really put the nail in the coffin was the claim she was beaten about the face two days before doing a no makeup photo shoot.

@snz530,"I remember the trial and just being very badly put off from how people defending Depp were talking about Heard because of just how excessively hateful they could be at the time. I picked up on the misogyny a lot of them were spewing. I picked up on how they focused on her body language and microexpressions, even though body language isn't a reliable indicator of how honest someone's being. Moreover though, I also picked up on the fact that a good chunk of people defending Depp came off like they didn't really care about him supposedly being abused and were just using that as an excuse to be vile about a woman without getting called out for it. Because they never seemed interested in talking about the abuse or the importance of supporting male victims of abuse. They were always more focused on dunking on Heard instead and just brought that stuff up whenever someone actually did point out that they were being terrible or just to look good.

I also felt pretty disturbed by how people were reacting live to the trial on streams. Some streamers who I respected (and are even widely respected) did that and I felt I really couldn't look at them the same for it.

It is because every time she opened her mouth during the trial it seemed like she was blatantly lying. I remember thinking no way in hell she was telling the truth. Depp was the one who looked abused. Also I lean left.,3,2024-10-15T14:53:59Z,2024-10-15T14:56:59Z

@robismrroyaloak2472,"For me, my disdain for amber heard had nothing to do with how depp's finger got severed or poop in a bed (although, she was caught exaggerating the size of her dog in order to make it more believable that it was the source), it was the fact that she was caught lying so many times. Lying about small things, lying about important things, lying about the dates of some photos and whether or not others were edited, lying about the donation of her divorce settlement, lying about her own injuries. It was nauseating and got to the point that her credibility was nothing. I agree that women should be listened to when they are claiming abuse of any kind. And while I don't expect victims to be angels, I do expect them to tell the truth to the best of their ability, or at least enough of it to be credible. She clearly did not, so not only do I not like her, I think it's unfortunate for future victims who need courage to find their voices to speak up about abuse. At the end of the day, not even the jury was swayed as she lost a case that was literally about her being a liar and defaming someone. I do believe she was a victim, but I also believe that she's a habitual liar. Maybe he is as well, but I just moved on because their relationship wasn't any of my business to begin with.",6,2024-10-15T13:19:41Z,2024-10-15T13:20:28Z

@haileys5224,"I had a different take on the D‚ÄôAngelo Wallace situation. I think it‚Äôs important to point out  that Prior to his video some people were speaking out, predominantly women. Many sizable creators spoke on the topic over a few months before the story got any traction. During this timing many WOC creators made videos. Although DW‚Äôs video was the catalyst, but it wasn‚Äôt until moist critical spoke out the story become mainstream stream and started getting spoken about by the other male commentary users. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt until a white man corroborated the words of another man that the story was grow as a legitimate concern. If Charlie did not coraborate DWs video I believe that the story would have gained traction but nothing close to the level we saw. Again it‚Äôs important to point out that in DWs video he references that mainly women have spoken about this and directly challenges his male colleagues to do the right thing. They only followed suit and replied to his call to action AFTER Charlie. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with your take on black creators being seen as moral arbiters. I just think the example you used was much more so a product of misogyny. I also think that if DW was a white man we wouldn‚Äôt have needed a second creator to co-sign his video.

Dude, maybe put your 'criticisms' for Amber Heard in a different vid from the one ostensibly explaining how she's an unequivocal victim in this situation.
""I don't like her because she dated Musk""? *The fuck are you on about here?* Slutshaming randomly before talking about the erasure of black women?
-When you see ""that"" piece of information, that she dated Musk, it's ultimately a microcosm of the erasure of black women?

You also don't need to put the caveat of ""I don't like her,"" like everyone else does. If you're turning the corner on this injustice, just have the courage to say she's an unequivocal victim, _unequivocally_ .



I found a comment from @whitalleys5893 that I think hits the vibe...
_""As an assault survivor this trial was so triggering. We put so much onus on survivors to be perfect or their experiences are invalidated. You could be Jesus Christ and they will find something to say you are a clown and a liar.""_

So imagine you make a video covering an unambiguous rape-victim... but you randomly throw in some shit about why you don't like them --- the fuck are you trying to achieve with that?",3,2024-10-15T11:16:09Z,2024-10-15T19:01:26Z

All of Heard‚Äôs audio recordings, some in secret and some not, prove beyond any doubt that what Heard found abusive about Depp was that he would remove himself from the situation when she became aggressive and violent and would never fight back.

People stopped defending Heard and putting her on a pedestal when the audio evidence of the actual truth came out.

@saradam1505,"i think the reason people say amber heard case was a backlash to metoo movement because we were supposed to ""learn"" from those movements how people react and respond to abuse and not do the thing the media and social environment ended up doing. like during the metoo movement all this was talked about and we were all writing retrospectives about how media treated women back in the day and then the moment we had to actually stand up, we failed. 
Also because the case became, for a lot of mra folks esp, a symbol of how abuse of men is never taken seriously(a serious problem) and that it was because of feminist movements(which is bullshit). so it became the flagship anti-metoo thing.

my ex fiance used to beat me really bad and I know he could and would have used my behaviour while made crazy by him against me if he had had the opportunity to. I'm also of an ethnicity that doesn't show bruises much so unfortunately I had nearly no evidence until a particularly bad night that happened around the same time I realised I deserved a chance to escape. be aware of common law rules in your place of living ladies, also know that canada doesn't have no-guilt divorce so you can't run away that easily. the amber heard trial was particularly triggering when it was covered all over youtube and I just felt like the evidence vindicated her and felt like this was what would have happened to me in court if I had got the cops involved. DARVO already was happening all the time so I was convinced he would convince everyone else I made him do it or whatever and any bad moment of mine would be brought up against me like it had been done to Amber.
I don't know where this is going but this case has weighed heavy on my heart and I couldn't help but feel some sort of afinity to this poor woman dragged through the mud. No she's not perfect, but it's impossible to stay yourself when you're being attacked by the person you love. It's a mindfuck like you wouldn't possibly imagine.

like and this isn't to say johnny is some innocent angel either.. he was batshit crazy too - they both were. and perhaps the media / social media was a bit more misogynistic in their dismissal / meme-ification of amber, that can be argued.. but her behavior in court and evidence presented sure didn't help her either.",9,2024-10-15T05:34:11Z,2024-10-15T05:34:11Z
@concernedcitizen6313,"I do not understand how anyone could watch the entire trial and come away thinking that Depp was the abuser and Heard was the victim.  I watched the entire thing (I didn't expect that I would, but as someone who finds legal issues and proceedings interesting, I did).  Also, I'm not some Depp superfan or whatever (I like his work, but that's about it), and I went into viewing the trial essentially thinking that they would probably both come across to the jury and the audience as mutually toxic people, mutually abusive people, or some combination thereof, and I was genuinely surprised by how much the _facts_ of the case, as well as the testimony by expert witnesses (although the term ""expert"" for many of AH's should be taken loosely and as a strictly legal term), supported Depp's side of things (while simultaneously watching the mainstream media put out ""reports"" on the trial that seemed to come from an alternate reality).  Frankly, I was surprised also by how much egregious misbehavior by Heard's legal team was allowed to get by with little reprimand by the judge, but I think that she was perhaps trying to give as little room for an appeal by either side as possible (something a lot of judges try to do since having your rulings overturned isn't exactly the greatest).

Anyway, it was a long time ago, and while I don't think that Heard should've won on any of the counts, the fact is that ultimately, the case was by and large resolved in a way that was consistent with the facts as they were presented in the trial, and considering the agreement they reached in light of her impending appeal, she got off pretty light.",10,2024-10-15T05:24:02Z,2024-10-15T05:46:23Z

@TheStorytellersBookClub,"Thank you for doing this video. I feel it‚Äôs very important to point out all the ways Depp did Amber Heard dirty. In addition to painting her as an abuser, he managed to use every ounce of his resources (his fan base being one of them) to systematically destroy her career. Destroy it to the extent of never being able to work in the American film industry ever again. It‚Äôs extremely foul. 

The messed up part is that there are unsealed court documents THAT DEPP FANS PAID FOR that proves Amber was telling the truth. Even one of Depp‚Äôs lawyers admits in a documentary about this witch hunt called a trial that she was a credible witness. Him getting away with what he did actually put non-famous women at risk. So many unhealed male survivors used the Depp trial as an excuse to dump on women.

What bothers me is that he‚Äôs going to continue to get away with lying.",2,2024-10-15T04:22:14Z,2024-10-15T04:22:14Z

Like everyone collectively dismissed that and then all I saw was Amber Heard ""jokes"" for MONTHS. I'm not a fan of her but holy shit, the amount of unhinged cope I saw. It made me feel so much disgust because I genuinely felt the trial should NOT have been public at all and Depp's team purposely made it a public circus. The pure spectacle, the betting on who would ""win"", the slander. My god. I hadn't seen that much vitriol towards a woman in some years.

I'm glad we can finally speak on the case now that the dust has settled. And maybe in a few more years people can openly discuss how fucked it all was more critically and with facts. Just disgusting. Depp literally has a record of abuse but somehow because Amber wasn't some perfect crying victim, she was the abuser. Somehow all the body language ""experts"" knew for sure she was the abuser no doubt, no evidence, just ""oh she smirked a bit, she's an evil narcissist."" 

I was exhausted for her. I can't even imagine how all that was for her.

Normally it isn't a problem for me to go against the grain, I mean, look at where I am, I will say true and unpopular anti-racist, anti-capitalist, anti-cop, pro feminist stuff day in and out, but it hits different when friends you thought would, at least, hear you out, shuts you down and calls you stupid.

@redlion145,"Why do you always strawman your opponents F.D.? You want to make out like somehow if I disagree with you, that makes me a manosphere alpha Andrew Tate wannabe. That couldn't be further from the truth. 

In general, I support the MeToo movement. But if I think that the justice system and the jury did their jobs in this instance, or if I read (actually read, which I've spent the last hour doing) about the case and come to the same conclusion as the jury, suddenly I'm a misogynist who hates all women? Puh-lease. Not everyone who disagrees with you is ignorant, or bigoted, or whatever word you want to cast aspersions with.

When I was in university my philosophy professors always stressed the principle of charity. Basically, whatever you're arguing for should include a brief (but accurate!) summary of whatever you're arguing against. In some contexts it's easy (and effective) to make the opposing argument look weaker by simply leaving out evidence, or connective tissue, or what have you. But if you really want to win, you summarize the strongest possible form of the opposing argument so that your takedown has all the more weight. You didn't do that in this video. Instead, you made ad hominem arguments against anyone you imagined might disagree with you.

I think my greatest issue with this video is... why now? Why relitigate something that was decided in the courts? What does this actually accomplish that couldn't be accomplished by focusing on a less ambiguous example of MeToo? This wasn't a dysfunctional power dynamic perpetuated by access, like with Weinstein , this was a personal relationship between two fully grown adults. I hate even talking about this case, I didn't watch or follow while it was going on. I think Hollywood types get too much of our attention, I don't want to give them anymore. But then you come along and make a video calling Depp (but not Heard) an abuser and it starts the whole thing over again.",7,2024-10-15T02:41:28Z,2024-10-15T02:41:28Z

The amount of manufactured hysteria around this case legitimately infested every aspect of the internet, but it was horrible seeing real creators with real faces and names engaging with this as if it were some hilarious bread and circuses, or worse, absolutely eviscerating Amber Heard because she was SO idiotic and foolish to think that anyone would ever believe that she had been abused. The fact that it didn't discriminate based on political POV or even based on content type was horrible, I can't even count how many creators I watched who like mowed lawns or groomed dogs or something that STILL threw in a joke about Amber Heard during this case. And that, plus the absolutely insane botted activity and harassment of anyone who didn't ardently believe that Amber Heard was the worst person in human history, made this a very scary moment in our culture.

@StealthMarmot_,"I think it's worth saying that a refusal to engage with certain things sometimes just is a reality of being a social activist. You cannot fight the whole world at once and expect to get anything useful done. You HAVE to pick your battles and not get hit by distractions. Amber Heard, while definitely a victim, was also a victim with her own level of fame, clout, and resources. Her career may have gone sour but she will, in the end, be fine. At least a lot more fine than many other victims.

It's also a narrative that is hard to fight and one that actually goes along with another issue that people are still dealing with: Men CAN be victims. Trying to battle for Amber would be taking a lot of people who were comforted by the idea that finally the idea of men being a victim is acceptable and crushing it, and they would think the ""Um, ACTUALLY..."" man hating feminist straw man is actually real since they are too blind to see a man getting ""abused"".

I'll also admit I was fooled by this propaganda, and I think that is how I might have, wrongfully, reacted at some point. And overall, it would have distracted from much more pressing, further reaching, and potentially winnable battles.",1,2024-10-15T01:50:15Z,2024-10-15T01:50:15Z

I'm not saying the trial shouldn't have happened, I'm saying that there shouldn't be public cameras in these courtrooms when we are talking about personal matters. I do care about the verdict, but that's a different point entirely. I think most people on the left who came away feeling as though Amber Heard was the actual abuser were like me and didn't really care about another celebrity trial. All I knew was what people told me at work about the trial, which is a terrible way to receive information at the best of times.

@xSwordLilyx,"I don't know what to think about this. This is all going to vary person to person. 

My own sister, who I raised since she was 10, tried to support her while allowing her space for being very sensitive, and as an adult she has been very cold to me, and have recieved quite a lot of disdain for my trouble, told me my abusive relationship, some of which I told her I have spoken to noone about, was my fault and she didn't believe me. 

She was very hooked on the fact that I didn't want to break up until I realized it was abuse and I wouldn't even get him in front of a councellor to discuss how his reality was false no matter how hard I tried. Sorry for being a woman I guess.

Her SO is the human equivalent of a deer, she has no idea what this is like. He would never hurt her, he can't; he always does as she says. I think she borders on abusive to him and for whatever reason he insists he likes it.

I was shocked and appalled to hear this. I had done my best to show her the value women have with each other and to support each other, I truly did. She has come to value being 'better' than others.

She also told me she can't stop her fiance from going fishing with said abusive person most weekends.

My friend and her former best friend was the only person to be truly supportive and she confided in me that what aspects of her previous relationship were abusive to her and my sister didn't believe her about and always have an excuse for his behavior. She stopped talking to her because she began to struggle with alcohol. With my support and away from that fucker she is doing well now.

I'm sorry I didn't invite her over for the nasty remarks he made sure nobody else would hear, all the time and effort he spent into getting me to trust him falsely, when he crawled into bed and yanked at my covers at 3am and had said he would be home at 11, or when he would secretely go off his meds. Or my being the only reason he didn't only eat ramen when he was out of work or had pants on his ass when he immediately started berating me as soon as I lost my job while I had strep throat.

Or accusing me of not caring that he wasn't earing when I was frequently asking if he had and if he would like anything and he lied. Or he accused me of lying about having PMDD when he was there when I was diagnosed. Maybe I should tape my dreams where he is still there, asking the fucking monkey to dance.

Or the time he told me I needed mental health care immediately which he 'didn't believe I'd get', and he would not be getting it himself when I had asked him to do so over an abusive incident the last year, but it didn't matter because he basically didn't care but I should still really try and grovel and see if I can earn it (probably by not being 'stubborn' which would involve being a complete pushover and giving him whatever he wants). Or when he told me he loved me the day before he left.

After which point I had to show up at his house to tell him what he had done was abusive and in what way and he whined I 'cornered him'. 

Maybe I should have screamed and called him every nasty thing I can think of while acusing him of screaming while just trying to be heard or gaslight him and laugh like he was stupid when I mention it like he did.",0,2024-10-15T01:45:14Z,2024-10-15T01:45:14Z

I realized that I was completely wrong. I know pro-Heard is a hot take that people gravitate to, but it's always from people who did not watch the full trial and are largely influenced by meta-narratives about the trial and dynamics. I get it, all those claims that Amber made about how women are treated is 100% true and common.. except hers was not that case. And, leftists like us are likely to agree with that perspective... except again, in her case it was false. Should we support women and recognize misogyny etc. that they face when they report it? Yes. But should we die on that sword in every situation, specifically, when there was demonstrative proof that in her situation, she was the abuser and had lied and got caught--no. Was Depp a toxic bf?

All public record in the UK if you want to check it out.

@lucasrusso813,"first of, im not a right pilled individual, i dont think fd signifier is a man hater, i actually think hes a great speaker with great views and points that i almost always agree with, however, i disagree with the sentiment of this video, on key thing was that it was not a red pilled take to support jhonny depp, hes not someone seen as a ultra masculine manly figure and infant, amber is a Texas native, i remember seeing so much more support from the red pill audience for her then for depp, second of, amber was never presented as someone likeable, believable and most of all, she wasent reliable, often times changing stories multiple times or just straight up lying, there were also other issues with her stories and financial reasoning and management such as when she pledged m money to charity, never paid it and then stated that she didn't sue depp for financial reasoning.
i think victims should always be taken seriously, and this idea that she was never taken seriously is not true, depp had movies canceled, brand deals canceled and the general thought was that he was an abuser, until the trial concluded, or more realistically, once the trial began it was pretty clear what happend throughout their relationship,
i dont think it was mutual abuse but i think amber threw the 10 punches and depp threw the 1, however in my own view, its bad enough that any were thrown in the first place, therefore the intention of why any were thrown is more important, and amber never convinced anyone that her reasoning made sense or truely was what had occurred, 
i dont think it was more interesting for clicks for depp to be innocent, the bigger more sellable story would be of the larger hollywood superstar being the evil abuser rather then a actress that most people new from starring alongside jason mamoa in the  super fish films.

But what I really, *really* hated about that whole thing was how many people (especially men) were ready to let this ONE situation of (allegedly) a woman lying about being abused as their definitive proof that women-as a whole-lie about being abused.
Everything that the Me Too movement did to shine a light on victims (including the chronically ignored male victims) was practically undone overnight because one woman allegedly lied about it.

Was ""oh no not my baby boy favorite pirate, I'm a feminist and i believe women but he couldn't have done anything because he's too much of a gentleman, clearly she's just a lying bitch"". Before they had even heard a single detail of the case, so many people i personally knew, many of whom identified as feminists (moderate liberal feminists but still) had already decided that she was lying. It was mind-numbing

And then a couple years later when the cases finally went to court that turned into a constant stream of ""believe male victims"" exclusively being used to paint a woman who spoke up in the exact same way women who speak up are always treated.

@pheonixangel_,"FD Signifier, I almost agree with every take you have on celebrities and what is happening in our society, but I cannot agree with you on this topic. It‚Äôs not just her personality or body language. Because let‚Äôs be honest, Johnny is a star actor. She‚Äôs admitted she has hit him. What‚Äôs worse - she lied in court. She committed perjury saying she never hit him. It was very telling on how much she tried to make herself as a victim and him as a monster. 

A telling quote from Amber ‚ÄúGo on. Tell the world. Tell the world that I, Johnny Depp, am a victim of domestic violence.‚Äù Tell me, would this sentence ever come from a victims mouth? Again, not painting her as a sole abuser, but I cannot void her from the title and call it justice.

Was it justice to lie that Johnny pushed Kate down the stairs and paint him as an abuser when Kate herself testified and stated he did not push her down? Was it justice for Heard to physically assault her ex girlfriend in an airport and accuse a lesbian officer or being homophobic? Was it justice from Amber to state in an article that she faced the wrath of society as they protect powerful men - when NO ONE protected Depp at the time (losing roles and the public opinion)?

@TWBFBR18,"Amber Heard beat Johnny up repeatedly during their marriage and relationship. There is ample testimony and photographs to support this. There is literally no evidence of him laying a hand on her besides her ever-changing testimony that varied in severity based on how much she could fake tears on the witness stand and bring attention to herself. We DO have solid evidence of him being maimed, losing part of his finger. Amber claimed to have been raped with a bottle and yet she was out and about the next day like nothing happened. There is no injury record or unedited  photos for her claims. There is nothing to support that account of such a brutal attack. Her explanations were laughably nonsensical the entire trial. 

It‚Äôs okay to accept that this woman is an abuser, and no, it is not ‚Äúreactive abuse‚Äù just because she is a woman and we feel like she deserves extra grace. It‚Äôs very well possible that Heard was abused by her father, past partners , etc. but the only solid and irrefutable evidence we have currently is that she hit her ex-girlfriend in public and she beat on Johnny. Stop giving this woman a pass. Also, idc if Johnny talked some trash in the heat of arguments and is a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù in pop culture. The simple fact is that he‚Äôs not a wife beater and every partner he has ever had has come to his defense of their own accord saying he‚Äôs gentle and kind. 

Is it possible that perhaps Johnny said some nasty things to Amber out of sheer exhaustion of dealing with her erratic and violent behavior?  Why does he not get the same excuse of ‚Äúreactive abuse‚Äù but she does?? This is misandry on all levels. And I will also acknowledge that some of the commentary on Amber has been cruel, but I don‚Äôt feel much sympathy for people who make up stories of abuse to get revenge on their ex-partners and spouses. She‚Äôs rightfully in the dustbin of Hollywood right now and she should stay there.",6,2024-10-15T00:57:29Z,2024-10-15T01:09:36Z

If at this day and age anyone still views that man as an uwu innocent victim, despite the vile things he said and admitted to doing, there's something wrong somewhere.

@nikkim8837,"Something that I noticed whilst the case was ongoing was that people saw what they wanted, and very few people were willing to discern the other way. My backstory, of an abusive mother that weaponised her white fragility to abuse my father, she has a completely clean criminal record for things that would've gotten her jailed if she had a tinge of melanin or masculinity. So when I saw the Depp Heard case, me and my brother's instinctual response was to see a man who even though he had all this power, could still be failed by the court system that saw white women as delicate and men as incapable of being abused. I heard all sorts of biases; people thinking it was accussing for fame, people that thought it was weirdo celebrity shit (the machine gun kelly ring was a headline at the time) and I honestly can say that whatever take (aside from 'women always do this') there's a case that the person taking that stance may not be sexist. 

Though I brought that bias up and was unsure on the concluding take, the one thing that always rubbed me the wrong way was the blood writing (though as someone who splits, could be understandable) and the televisation of the trial, which honestly should've never happened. Despite reading her article and having a coworker listen to the court livestream, I couldn't come to a conclusion with the cursory ""facts"" I was given (because the reporting was so deceptive ie that she sliced his finger, and lbr in todays climate regardless of validity, the word allegedly almost gets translated at 'definitely happened but I can't legally say it [yet]')

It disgusts me that even though I WAS FULLY AWARE of that bias, the media still fucking played me. Even with the doubt I had, I still felt bad that my internalised misogyny could put a male abuse victim into question, when 'I would immediately believe a female victim.' What a fucking joke. The fact that Depp tried to use this to paint himself as a sad ugu baby male victim and everyone went along with it and CLOWNED on Heard (damn, even potential female abusers still have to be demeaned and not taken seriously. Wait. WAIT. DID WE JUST UPGRADE THE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE JOKE OF A FEMALE ABUSER AGAIN.) and that even the most card carrying bias acknowledging leftist can be aware of the trap...and still fucking jump on the rake.

We need to do better, but (or rather, and) fuck man if that media can't do some selective manipulation.",3,2024-10-15T00:30:09Z,2024-10-15T00:30:09Z

Many people see the vitriol that Amber Heard received as misogynist but it was based more on frustration on females that abuse the system, especially if they are white female tears.

@kenjr.4548,"I totally understand and appreciate the point you're trying to make but as a woman that sat through the trial live and rewatched most of the testimonies several times I'm still not convinced that Amber Heard can be categorized as a victim in the same way that i don't categorize Johnny Depp as a victim (anymore, I used to at the beginning of the trial). She tried to submit edited photos as evidence of abuse and she painted fake bruises onto her face and openly presented it to people in her circle. When it comes to a trial like this the lawyers had to be very thorough and somehow there was nothing her lawyers could use during most of the cross examinations that helped Amber at all, other than Depps' drug and alchohol abuse. And I understand that Johnny Depp is a powerful celebrity but, Amber Heard is also a powerful celebrity who arguably had more financial resources than he did during the relationship and the trial (if I remember correctly, I may be wrong on this part). Of course Depp played his part in the toxic relationship, he's not a  blameless victim either and he probably lied about her abuse of him as well. The problem I can't resolve with her is that she directly lied about physical abuse and effectively cast doubt onto to topic of abuse for women in the justice system and  cast doubt onto the phrase ""believe all women"". Mysogynists now use her as an example of why we shouldn't believe victims of abuse. I can acknowledge that Depp probably also commited the same offense and he should've been scrutinized the same as she was on this point,  but he got away with it scott free. Now that it's been a few years it's clear that the case and trial were going to be a media circus from the beginning, and both parties knew that. And it became exactly that in the worst way possible. Now, this is where I get heated. In my opinion they had a toxic relationship and they chose to run with it and put it on display for the judge and jury, and unintentional on Heards part, for the general public as well. I don't like Heard or Depp at all because of this. They essentially made a mockery of the justice system and threw their cash at the problem hoping to sqeeze as much out of eachother as possible both emotionally and financially. I'm sure the judge had more important cases to work on rather than settling a squable between two petty children who lack emotional maturity.

Amber heard had a pattern of lying, had a pattern of verbal abuse to get a reaction, had a habit of trying to isolate and manipulate in more than just her romantic relationships. I will say the media portrayed her in an unfair light but their relationship was definitely mutually toxic and abusive.

@fenshipismagic,i always appreciate you breaking down the unique position white women have as an oppressed class. i often think that white feminist made a mistake by stealing the privilege framework from antiracism work because of how gender works differently and white women have that weird proximity to the people with privilege. as a white trans person i've spent a lot of time trying to think through it because i see these dynamics play out as white nonbinary people try to preserve their status as white women even while they transition and use the benefits it grants against tpoc and other people in the community,2,2024-10-14T23:20:39Z,2024-10-14T23:20:39Z

@NickW855,"@5:50 - OK, so how do you reconcile this position with your self-admitted unresearched opinion that Mike Tyson is guilty?  Your video on him has you on the record stating ""He did it.""  His accuser was previously guilty of filing false charges against a partner alleging rape, and all of Tyson's supporting witnesses were blocked from testifying.

If Black men are more likely to be falsely accused, why is your default position on Mike Tyson to assign guilt instead of just saying you don't know if he did it?  You also know for a fact that Robin Givens was emotionally abusive towards him and you say as such, so I don't see why it's so hard to believe he was taken advantage of in a similar way and given an unfair trial because the judicial system is inherently racist towards Black men.

@Libssmith1982,"Thankyou for using your platform to help right this monumental miscarriage of justice. Couple of takeaways
1. It wasnt a mobile phone, it was the phone depp claimed was not on the wall in the bar area during his VA testimony which in his UK testimony he says he recalls smashing it into the wall before ripping it off.
2. Amber did nothing wrong, she tried to love him and help rid him of his four decade long demons, being alcohol and drugs. 
3. You don't like her because she dated musk? She left him as quickly as she found him, took no money and also walked from over 30 million of Depps pirates money to avoid being labelled a 'gold digger' maybe you don't like her because you don't know enough about her? For instance did you know she has been a humanitarian since teenage years and was the first female actor to be named a Human Rights Champion? She has been recognised for her life saving work in the middle east for kids who needed cleft palate surgery and women in Lebanon who suffer ptsd. All her exes have nothing but good to say about her, the same cannot be said for Depp. Anyway, I'm certain you might grow to 'like' her if you found out more about who she is as a person. Hard to do considering the misinformation and smear campaign against has been going since 2016 when she obtained a tro against depp and filed for divorce. It was a well orchestrated well funded Russian and saudi bot campaign that you can find out all about via the podcast Who Trolled Amber by tortoise. Anyway, that's it, that's me done.

I don‚Äôt even know why anyone wants to intrude like that in the abomination that was this public trail but nevertheless, people watched it with voyeuristic glee, happily diving into ableism against Heard and using all these very harmful ideas of ‚Äûreal‚Äú victimhood to discredit her. It was scary. And the way they seem to want to determine ‚Äûreal‚Äú victims spread into our friendship (not because of Amber Heard) and eventually lead our friendship to a very painful end (for me at least). And yes. These former friends of mine claim to be ‚Äûqueer feminists‚Äú and claim to be deeply into ‚Äûanti-discrimination‚Äú. If all you can think about are black and white extremes like ‚Äûvictim‚Äú ‚Äûabuser‚Äú ‚Äûguilty‚Äú and ‚Äûinnocent‚Äú, you are harming victims. Also: People who are abused are allowed to protect themselves. And retaliate. With violence, if necessary. Be happy you don‚Äôt know what it feels like to be a victim. And if you know what it is like but are still stuck in this stage, don‚Äôt make it other people‚Äôs problem.
This is btw the reason why I fear so much about the Giselle Pelicot case. Right now, she is portrayed as this perfect victim. What happens if they find out she isn‚Äôt?

@supermaryg,"having a group of guy friends online who you consider ""safe"" suddenly talk about amber heard being a crazy golddigger who used JD to build her career - absolutely devastated. Not because I'm a fan I haven't seen a single one of her films, but because how easily it was for them to come to that longstanding narrative that has never been based in reality. I was a good decade older than most, so they didn't see any of the Anita Hill, Lebowski, and Bobbitt stuff first hand. I did, but I was young. I guess I just assumed they wouldn't fall into that same nonsense of women needing to be the perfect victim before talking about their trauma... and I thought AH actually being an actress before JD would save her from that label, not at all. Who has ever gotten rich/famous from their abuse? It's one of the first things women are accused of when they come forward, and it *always* comes up at some point if it's anyone in a position of power (as if someone in power could never be an abuser/manipulator). When has that actually happened tho? Who are all these women who made a career/fiscal empire out of their abuse stories?
And yes one or two responded with ""Anita Hill"" which they quickly regretted because they clearly had no idea about anything, they just knew her name. Best first question to ask is ""why was there a trial"" - one said ""she sued him for it"" so yeah they really didn't know anything. Literally asking baseline questions of ""who even was she"" ""what was he accused of doing"" ""where is she now"" -- nope. it's just her name and this huge false association. As infuriating as it is, I try to be informative about it because when I was younger and if you asked me about  Lebowski or Bobbitt, I would've absolutely thought they were instigators in the situation, and I had to be educated as well. OH, there was one person who made a comment about blasey-ford 'ruining kavannaugh's career' and this was *months* after he was a justice and I had just read the week before that she had to move, i think a fourth time at that point, so I was *not* hearing that bs.

But even then, the mocking, oversexualized, and downright misogynistic vitriol leveled at Amber Heard disturbed me. It was as if, in the eyes of her detractors, she was not one person who had done a horrible thing to her partner, but the embodiment of every woman who had ever offended these people, and therefore an acceptable target for all the sexist hatred they were not allowed to hurl at ""good girls."" It began to feel less and less like they doubted her story of being assaulted and therefore the lie was funny, and more like the very idea of a woman being assaulted was funny to them. Regardless of who the true victim was, this was undoubtedly the worst time in someone's life. And it was being trotted out and paraded around as grotesque public entertainment.

@empresspoobah,"Why are you trying to exonerate Amber? If you watched trial and saw the evidence you would know there is a reason the jury found her guilty. She is evil personified. Johnny did not try to hide his demons where as Amber fabricated evidence and lied about pooping the bed. The physical evidence is there - google it. That did come from a small dog. Making poop jokes and actually doing it is just beyond. She also lied about her drug use and his finger. There is a recording of her apologising for it, but rewriting history is easy. I could go on and on. She deserves all the hate she gets and more. I as say all this as a woman who does not take kindly to women lying about men. There is just no excuse for it.

Perfect victim? She is not a victim. There is evidence of her abusing previous partners whereas there is nothing like that about Johnny. I am not a Depp fan to a large degree. I have never seen a pirate movie although I have seen his older films. I paid no attention to this case until the evidence started to come out.

@danakerjbam,"I don‚Äôt think I can go as far as your here, FD. I appreciate your desire to correct your own insensitivity, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she wasn‚Äôt just an imperfect victim, she manipulated the sentiments of the time and made clearly untrue statements and accusations. And Depp absolutely paid a price for it - he lost pretty much all his work as soon as the accusations were made public, which was clearly the point. I agree, his behaviour was absuive at times, toxic and unnacceptable. But if we‚Äôre going to be fair, it has to be acknowledged she simply was worse. No one needs to cape for her to recognize it‚Äôs complicated.

I see a lot of commenters here wanting to simply talk about discourse and history. That‚Äôs fine - so long as the facts of the case, what actually happened, is acknowledged as the most important thing to get right in a court of law, This wasn‚Äôt just the public making a decision based on presumption and unproven accusations. That‚Äôs what SHE did. In court she was found - by a jury of 12 actual people - to be dishonest, unreliable and ultimately guilty of slander.

So many women have similar stories (though not to that extent ofc) of having been abused by a man and when they turn to tell others about it they react with ""oh, but he's such a nice guy, he'd never do that!"" It was most likely very triggering for many women online. I know for me personally it was a hard time to be online, and I'm not even a content creator.

@FGrimmes,"Speaking of bringing facts to disinformation 26% of men are victims of partner violence (https://www.cdc.gov/intimate-partner-violence/about/index.html) the vast majority of which is by women (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/21961/cdc_21961_DS1.pdf)

A huge amount of victims felt seen when a story of a seeming male abuse victim gained traction. Because as you mention at 5:53 male victims of abuse usually just pass by without coverage. But if redpill types are the only ones discussing male victims then those discussions will always devolve into redpill topics. And those topics will get popular because for millions of men it's the only place their abuse gets acknowledged.

If you want to combat this then stories like 5:53 shouldn't be a 10 second sidenote in another video. They should be covered giving full dignity to the men victimized. This will give light to millions of victims, starve redpill topics of their audience, and combat a lot of misinformation about male victims.

The reality is a hell of a lot of people will not acknowledge that a man can be a victim, much less how widespread that victimization is.

When you say at 25:30 ""abuse victims everywhere feel like their stories and experiences are being erased"" that's more true than you know.",3,2024-10-14T22:05:43Z,2024-10-14T22:05:43Z

@easyaccessjeans,"I really appreciate you making this video. I remember being particularly captivated by all of this, and my wife and I made a concerted effort to watch through the entirety of the trial live. What really muddied the waters was that while it was so clear to us that Depp was the abuser and primary aggressor, Herd made some very unfortunate calls when it came to defending herself, and it made her come off as ""crazy."" The trial wasn't really about whether abuse had occurred or not, but rather, whether specific statements were defamatory or not. By Herd not being the ""perfect victim,"" she would sometimes embellish certain aspects of *what actually did occur.* Amber Herd was abused by Johnny Depp. Unarguablly. But in an effort to either make it seem more believable, or make things appear more grave, she said and did some things that were somewhat misleading. It's not that she wasn't an abuse victim. She was. But as many abuse victims have done before, she sometimes told the equivalent of white lies in order to more fully make her point. This is why Depp ultimately (mostly) won the case. Not because he wasn't the abuser (he absolutely was), but because of what essentially add up to technical inaccuracies in the narrative(s) she portrayed. It's tragic because Depp is not a good man, Herd was his victim, and we ought to be sympathetic to the choices Herd made while suffering as an abuse victim. Many of them were arguably not the best judgement calls in retrospect, but people in these awful situations are often responding out of a sense of desperation.",1,2024-10-14T21:34:16Z,2024-10-14T21:34:16Z

@Augustusdramaticus,I watched the whole trial. Amber claimed ( on the stand) that she was assaulted  with a broken bottle and had to fight him on broken glass and the next day she had no injuries.   Before the trial and all the audio came out ( proving she was abusive) everyone believe her which is why JD  got canceled and removed from Pirate of the Caribbean and other movies.  Idk what's happening right now but Amber Heard and Megan's situation are NOT the same. I feel like if you're going to comment on these things you should have most of the information.  Did you watch the trial? Have you seen the information about her excluding evidence and lying?  Have you seen the evidence of her being abusive with other partners before?

@hopefulbadger2160,"Not quite finished with the video, but as somebody who maybe has been misled by misinformation? (I'm not sure yet) I would like it to be known that for at least some people, the cure to misinformation is well documented information. 

Sorry, I've been in some other comment sections honestly asking and trying to understand this stuff. And I've gotten told literally to go kick rocks. While explicitly stating that I am willing to be moved.

I understand where that energy comes from, there are a lot of asshats that will talk about this and ask a lot of bad faith questions. That sucks and I'm really sorry. That said, I would like to believe that I am in and of myself proof that some people can be swayed away from disinformation with information. 


I'm only halfway through, I assume that he's going to address the audio recording at some point? That was the one that always got me. It just sounded so... I don't know it got me. I've heard it was edited? I'm not sure. If anyone has the unedited version that they can link to me, please do I am desperate for the real information. I want to know if I have been misled. 

I will completely admit, I don't want to have been misled. Doesn't feel good. But I'd rather get swayed to the right side now then continue being wrong. Especially cuz, I'll admit I think that I probably did make an amber turd joke once or twice. I'm not proud of that in any situation at this point. But, if it is in fact death was just flat out abusive and heard was not, I will feel like a huge ass and that sucks. Sucks way less for me than it does for her. But it's not a great feeling anyways.

@Johnmyork23,"I think that Depp truly believes he's a nice guy, and he may be most of the time, but most of the time isn't ALL of the time and alcohol, love, and desire are all powerful forces. 

I think that most of what happened between them is not representative of their characters as a whole, and while I do think they should both get proffesional help, I do think that this is not enough for us to be judgemental at this point. 

Mam people especially as they get older, and desperation sets in, act wildly out of character. 

We and Heard & Depp should all just be grateful that no serious injuries or death resulted other than broken hearts (which is I acknowledge very serious, some would prefer death to a truly broken heart). 

We as a species have not yet developed to a point where our hearts heal more easily. 

I think we'd all do best to forgive both Depp and Heard but seriously ask them that they learn from this. Life is short.

But having watched the interviews with Depp on the criterion version of the movie, I feel like Depp either learned all the wrong lessons hanging out with HS Thompson, or had his worst traits amplified by his friendship with Thompson. Hunter S Thompson was a monster to his family, and I think that Depp saw those behaviors as a virtue as he befriended and learned from Thompson. 

In the trial, he was carrying himself so much like Thompson that it was almost as if he was making a sequel to Fear and Loathing. That ""joke"" where he and his friend talked about unaliving and r-wording Heard was very on brand with Thompson, and it was sickening to hear Depp defend it.",3,2024-10-14T21:07:21Z,2024-10-14T21:07:21Z

@klpaah,"Please help resolve some confusion - is this video saying that people suddenly believe Amber Heard when she lied so much and was so deceptive? Specifically, what new evidence has come to light? I don't really see it mentioned in this video. I know FD said he wasn't going to get into it, but I haven't been able to locate the sources that seem to be referenced here. 

Or is the message that she simply should also be seen as human, even though she's a fucked up human being, because even fucked up human beings don't deserve to be abused? Because if so, that is a message I'm 100% in support of. 

But if not, please keep reading...

What follows is lifted from Reddit, but lines up with everything I've been able to find from the trial:

- She was caught lying multiple times about multiple things (she didn't donate her settlement money, she claimed to be using a make up kit that wasn't even released at the time, etc.)

- She was caught admitting faked or tampered with evidence.

- She had, other than a friend and her sister IIRC, no one confirming any of her stories. Quite the opposite even. For example, her own make up artist stated to never have seen any bruises on her. The TMZ guy did everything except come out and say blatantly that AH herself leaked the story to them. 

- She was caught smirking, eyerolling and grinning when people were describing abuse they endured/witnessed from her end.

- There is leaked audio of her berating JD and calling him a baby after punching him.

- JD has multiple, credible witnesses confirming his side of things, along with recorded conversations and photos.



Now, to be clear, I'm no JD apologist. Nor do I take up the mantle for pretty much any man in Hollywood. Abuse is too widespread and there's just too much we never see to really feel like there's anyone to look up to these days.

Is JD abusive? Yeah, I believe that. Finding out that he hung out with Marilyn Manson was enough to convince me to never be a fan of his ever again. 

But is Amber Heard believable? From what I can currently see, it seems like the answer is still ""hell no."" I feel the attempts at admitting false evidence alone should have destroyed her credibility. 


So is this video saying that there's been a lot of evidence that Amber Heard was right about things that we thought she was wrong about? 

Or is this video simply trying to remove the false notion that, simply because he won a trial, doesn't mean that JD is a saint that people should idolize? Because, again, if this is the case, I'm 100% in support of that message.

Thanks in advance.",1,2024-10-14T20:33:45Z,2024-10-14T20:33:45Z
@domeatown,"Shes a bad person, tho. She has had girlfriends allege abuse. Perpetrators are often victims. Most of them are not. That is what I studied intensively in uni. The protective factors that make some people become what they hate and others adjust and avoid it. I think the discourse surrounding all of this has made that dynamic far too simplified. Neither of them is a hero.  DARVO is real, and I became reactive in a relationship where I was DARVOd. But I never did any of those actions before or since leaving, and both of them have. This relationship was the collision of two supernovas, and I resent people saying she is innocent. Its not an accurate portrait. But I also hate people saying he is just completely free of fault. The whole thing was just an incinerator ready to blow. It was two sharks locked in battle.

It's sad to me that someone like Amber Heard could even remotely represent any version of feminism, because in my eyes anyone with that much wealth isn't really subjected to the struggles of most women, black or white.  Sure, theoretically if Johnny Depp was crazy and crafty enough he could have tracked her down and k'd her.  But most of us, like my mom when my sister and me were kids .... leaving our dad was as dangerous as staying with him.  When you have limitless money to have lawyers, hire people to move your stuff, even have bodyguards, then you can can focus purely on the emotional part of it.

@ChillGoblin,"100% agree with you about the insane misogynistic vilification of Amber Heard. Based on the information we had there was no reason to assume the worst about her. The internet reaction to this case was alarming and revealed a widespread hatred for women I would be much happier to believe didn't exist. ""They don't believe in the misinformation because they think it's true, they believe in it because it's THEIR truth."" Very well said.

Respectfully, though- I'm also skeptical of attempts to paint Depp as the unambiguous villain. Yes, absolutely: patriarchy is real, men have power, men are statistically more likely to be perpetrators of abuse than victims of it. But we simply cannot use broad statistics and feminist readings of larger society to determine the truth in individual cases. As you mention, men can be victims of abuse as well. Women can even make false accusations. I find it disturbing to hear people like yourself talk about Johnny Depp in absolute terms, when we simply don't absolutely KNOW what happened.

We know enough about abuse to have the correct take about Amber Heard. There are no ""perfect victims"", and pointing out an alleged victim's flaws is a time-tested way to cast doubt on their testimony. The case against Heard was full of this garbage. But the way I see it, what you are doing here- maybe without realizing it- is using the exact same tactics to make a case against Depp that you imagine will be most acceptable to your audience. You point out how he was proven to be intoxicated, how he has a documented history of making poop jokes, etc- and therefore he IS the singular guilty party here. These are at best relevant points, but just like the circumstantial evidence against Heard, they are NOT direct proof of abuse.

It's a messy case, and like you I have little interest in diving deep into it. But from what I've heard and certainly from what you've presented here, I find a case painting either party as the single malicious abuser thoroughly unconvincing. There IS such a thing as mutual abuse, as mutually toxic or even violent relationships, and until the burden of proof has been satisfied in either direction I think this explanation is the safest & satisfies my sense of justice the best. Fence-sitting won't make you popular but sometimes it's the responsible position. Just my 2 cents.",2,2024-10-14T20:20:47Z,2024-10-14T20:20:47Z

@biancachristie,"So this comment is going to get lost in the 2000+ others under this video, but I do want to ask about the place Nicole Brown Simpson in this discourse.  OJ‚Äôs defense, such as it was, for his abuse of her was that he was ‚Äúa battered husband‚Äù and that their relationship was, yes, mutually abusive.  I‚Äôm old enough to remember how, over time, the legal case‚Äîa trial about the *murder* of two people‚Äîreficused into a referendum on race in America and the racism of the LAPD and its officers.  I‚Äôm not saying that Mark Fuhrman and his ilk didn‚Äôt need to be exposed as garbage human beings (they are, and I‚Äôm glad the whole country got to see exactly how their noxious beliefs played out when they were given positions of power).  However, OJ Simpson was an abuser, and I believe he was also a murderer.  His defense team used a complex strategy that included the old blame-the-victim tactic (Nicole was a slut‚Äîthe BJ with her kids upstairs, her friendship with Faye Resnick, etc) along with an emphasis on the LAPD‚Äôs racial bias to refocus the trial away from what one singular human being (obviously, at least to me) did to another.  ;Even Johnny Cochran later said (I may get this exact quote wrong), ‚ÄúWe used the race card, and we dealt it from the bottom of the deck.‚Äù  The picture that was painted was (overtly) that Nicole had it coming (from someone, somehow)‚Äîand that OJ was a suspect, not because of his relationship with her, but because of his race.  Yes, the LAPD (along with  many other police departments to this day) structurally supported racism.  Also, Nicole and Ron Goldman were viciously murdered by a black man.  All these things can be true at the same time.  The absence of a perfect victim and a perfect law enforcement agency, and the presence of a suspect who (in very different circumstances) could have been a victim of that law enforcement‚Äôs worst impulses, doesn‚Äôt exclude the evidence.

@RipIPDime,"So, my wife was *really* invested in the Heard/Depp trial when it was going on and, while I'm not an expert on those events or domestic abuse, I do have to say I'm not surprised to hear that the coverage of Amber Heard does not frame her as a victim needing support. In generally, it's a tough subject because neither Heard nor Depp were perfect, and both of them did some bad stuff. 

When it comes to who abused whom, I don't remember that well how much real, admissible evidence there was compared to hearsay and he-said-she-said. I know there are a lot of problems when it comes to evidence of abuse. A lot of abuse either doesn't produce evidence, or the evidence must be documented immediately and ""by the book"" for it to be useful. But the way Heard and her legal team operated through this whole process makes it hard for me to assume that the story is as simple as one-way abuse from Depp (or even an ""action-reaction"" scenario where Depp was the principle antagonist).

When it comes to media coverage and public support - I think that a lot of people don't want to associate Amber Heard with the general movement to support abuse survivors because she.. seems to have done a lot of lying. Even if she didn't lie as much as people say, the way everything played out resulted in Heard having very poor credibility. Unfortunately, that plays into a lot of society's fears that people can make false allegations and ruin somebody's life. And while Depp's life wasn't ruined, by any real measure, he did lose a LOT of work. Like, big time work. 

Personally, I would be more worried of people trying to paint a clear-cut narrative that *either* of these people are innocent of real abuse. There is too much obfuscation and hearsay to really come to an impartial conclusion, so I don't really blame a lot of people for letting this discourse die with the trial.",0,2024-10-14T19:50:05Z,2024-10-14T19:50:05Z
@xdelbarrio,"initially I ignored the Depp v Heard thing since I knew he had lost in the UK (not much more) and as far as I knew at the time the laws regarding defamation in the US are more lenient so I thought it was a foolish attempt by Depp and his team to rile up social media in all of it

so after he won (initially) I did some research on it and particularly read the UK sentence and a couple testimonies and what I read was insane abuse coming from Depp and his team and it made me even more perplexed in how he won the US case, I didn't watch as much on the testimonies and evidence presented in the US but most seemed the same, so knowing Amber had lost was insane to me, what they did to that woman infuriated me to no end and I spent like a couple months talking to anyone that mentioned the trial what a travesty it was

So to see her being accused of this in a trial of abuse regarding a white man was fucking bizarre. Furthermore, I think it was really telling that people were incapable of accepting that an abuse victim can have toxic/unhealthy traits that doesn't erase or equate them with their abuser. I definitely could tell much of the public story was mired in laundered stories that we're likely all missing elements of the truth (in Amber's case especially it's important to remember trauma fucks with your memory and recollection). I think a big reason why there was the push back there was had largely to do with the normalization of misogyny in leftist spaces under the guise of gender expansiveness.

@FillingPlotholes,"The moment the case blew up, I felt like it was odd that this case was getting the attention it was gettin. It just felt so off how much hate was going towards Heard. It felt very GamerGate hivemind. Following my bullshit detector and looking into this, it made less and less sense until all of it clicked - Depp was using the case to publicly slander Heard and rebuild his own reputation. I felt like I was going crazy being the only one who realised what Depp was actually doing, and seeing all my friends also think this was a case of ""mutual abuse"" (at best) only made me think I was more crazier because Depp's tactics were working on even progressive people. Princess Weekes' video was a blessing to my sanity and my case when it initially came out, but since then, I never saw anyone argue from Heard's perspective again, and this whole shit was just kinda forgotten about.

@capefeather,"I started viewing so-called ""LawTube"" as mostly a force for evil because of this controversy. This video touches on it about halfway in, but lawyers on YouTube weren't ever going to set the story straight. You see the proof of this even now when seemingly most people think Johnny Depp was exonerated in a criminal trial when what actually happened is that the two sued each other and both suits won, but the net payout went to Depp - just the most basic of basic facts gotten wrong by people who allegedly sat through hours of trial footage. Maybe some of these LawTubers were just naive, but I can't accept that cashing in on a controversy relevant to their profession wasn't the primary motivating factor for them. I get that I'm throwing shade at a fellow Nebula person here, but still. It was bad enough that these people were going around shitting on one of my favourite video game series for clout, but this was a whole different level of actual evil.

@cognitivedissonance1773,"I don't know. I felt Johnny Depp is an abusive alcoholic... but that Amber heard could have left if she wanted to.. but chose to stay in order to record him to get extract a huge payday/settlement from their divorce. She was free to leave at any point and had money from her own career... She was not trapped in a domestic relationship with no where to go... she had Friends, she had boyfriends, she had money, he was too drunk to stop her.. she CHOSE to stay to gaslight and record him doing stuff to get the max payday for herself. She even intimated that she abused HIM and was recorded saying something to the effect of... you are a man... no one is going to care or believe that you are a victim of abuse. No one will side with you..  you will lose in court and in the public. Basically saying that she can say or do whatever she wants to him and everyone will believe her side because our current model after me too was ""believe all women""... which implies... don't believe the man's side. This does not excuse or make better any of his drunken behavior of course.. but Amber is NOT your 1950's helpless housewife with 5 children, no job and nowhere to go with a drunk husband. She had white female privilege, had money and friends AND boyfriends like James Franco and Elon Musk and a career that was looking up... and she chose to stay and record him in order to gaslight, blackmail and extract wealth. Johnny Depp certainly probably started the abuse by being an alcoholic. But even that is based on speculation. What if she was generally a happy drunk and it was her abuse of him that got him upset when he was drunk.. what if the only footage she had of him was from gaslighting him on purpose to get the drunk angry enough to do something stupid that she could use against him in court.. There are no perfect victims and there are no perfect abusers either. Both are flawed individuals with their own world view where they are BOTH the heroes of their own stories and in their stories the other is the abuser and none of the rest of us was in their relationship to decide which person was more honest in our view... and even if we were there... we would have no insight into their minds to tell us who had good motives or bad motives for any of their actions..",2,2024-10-14T19:02:50Z,2024-10-14T19:02:50Z

@MGC-XIII,"10:50 from what the court showed, what you just described is Johnny's reaction to Heard's abuse.
That's the story that was being told, that she is the instigator.
We even saw video footage of this in the court.

So unless the whole story has been flipped upside down and her lawyer team was even more inept than what we saw, it seems like Amber instigated every time and Johnny retaliated out of frustration.

That is likely why most people are apprehensive about the videos coming out now.

I have seen other people bring Anita Sarkeesian up, but with her, I don't feel like she got vilified for her videos.
She got vilified for being an obvious grifter.

@jameswatson9338,"Thank you so much for applying understanding and nuance to this situation. That is such a rare thing to do. The Depp/Heard trial felt like a giant gaslighting festival. Anything that came out of Heard's mouth was automatically dismissed by the public, as if she needs to be a perfect person in order to qualify as a DA victim. 

There's a reason we said ""believe women."" It's because currently, women who come out with allegations against men are not even given the benefit of the doubt. No one cares to investigate or even believe it's possible that the abuse occurred. You automatically get called a liar, manipulator, and whatever other stereotypes society likes to apply to outspoken women. That's why we have millions of rape test kits gathering dust on shelves instead of being tested. 

The fact is, less than 10% of rape accusations are false according to studies. The fact is, SA and DA are rampant in this culture, especially against women. There's this narrative going around, embraced so easily by so many people predisposed to misogyny, that men at large are under attack by false allegations of abuse. Or maybe, just maybe, there is A LOT of abuse against women because we live in a patriarchy that doesn't respect women's minds and bodies. Maybe, just maybe, we're inclined to believe the ""he"" in any ""he said, she said"" situation because sexism is engrained in American culture just like racism.",1,2024-10-14T18:50:28Z,2024-10-14T18:50:28Z

@darwinism8181,"I think this whole trial hit anyone who's been through domestic abuse real hard. I was in an extremely emotionally abusive relationship for a few years and... it's fucked up. Abusers like to poke and prod and find your buttons, and once found they will ruthlessly press those buttons to get a reaction out of you that they can point to and go, ""Aha! See! You are the offender in this situation!"" and then double down on their abuse because it is now 'justified.'

It's messy, and abusive relationships often end up with mutual abuse. I know that I am horrified at how I acted towards the end of that relationship, and I am wholly responsible for my actions, and knowing that that is a specific part of how abusers function only goes so far to help you feel like you aren't just as bad as your abuser.

And then there was this whole charade with Depp doing all the standard abuser tricks only with the active aid of media outlets and social media, and I just had to stop looking at any story about it after a while.",1,2024-10-14T18:48:52Z,2024-10-14T18:48:52Z
@sapphic.flower,I hope this quickly becomes the popular opinion and people realize how much harm they caused by inserting themselves in the Heard vs Depp case so vehemently. I get wanting to seek justice against abusers and Johnny's lawyer (look him up) was very successful in manipuling the public. They knew exactly how reactionary and morally righteous the internet is and used it to their advantage (live streaming a court case should've been a red flag). But there was also something visibly misogynistic and self-agrandizing about how the public portrayed Heard as some desperate psychopathic abuser undeserving of any sympathy or consideration.,4,2024-10-14T18:48:49Z,2024-10-14T18:50:05Z

The State pressed charges (not Megan) and then deemed him guilty based on the testimony of several people that were: 
1: trying to remember something that happened a year prior 
2: drunk when it happened 
3: obviously lying, trying to get the case thrown out... Because they were kinda all at fault (Megan slept with her best friend's man, Tory cheated on Kelsey, and Kelsey tried to shoot her best friend).",2,2024-10-14T18:44:11Z,2024-10-14T18:44:11Z

And i shouldn't have to share my abuse online to explain why i support a famous woman. 
I'd end up deleting tiktoks, having to block people harassing me.
I also remember hearing the stories of ""bad boy"" johnny depp as a kid. Trashing hotel rooms, attacking photographers, dating extremely young women.
I thought he was so cool, cos the media made him sound cool.
As an adult, i know it wasn't cool.

I'd also like to mention that the harassment campaign against her also affected how she was treated by costars, apparently Jason Mamoa was awful to her on the Aquaman sequel. 
People laugh at that. 
Jason Mamoa is now on my garbage celeb list.
JD has received very little pushback aside from losing roles, which he deserved to lose, although, getting booted off a terf wizard movie wasnt the worst thing for him.
But the guilt i felt from my past abuse and never feeling like i was a ""perfect victim"" and seeing that in the attacks Amber Heard faced and not being a vocal advocate for her still weirdly haunts me.

I genuinely can't believe how disillusioned everyone was during the case. I can't believe we a supposedly 'progressive' society (talking about America), did that to a woman.

@kport6219,"Something that I think is very understated is how much credence was put on the trial, because everyone who commented on it presumably watched it. I will admit, Depp's team did a great job defending him and played on a lot of biases people have towards legal trials. Given how long the trial went, it was easy to forget certain details. Like, a common refrain I hear consistently about this trial is that ""Amber claimed she had mountains of evidence, but where was it during the trial?"" and just watching what was streamed, that is an understandable line of reasoning. What a lot of people neglected to check for, especially after the unsealed documents were released or in the Heard's appeal brief, was that she provided a lot of her medical records and text messages as a means to back up her interpretation of events. They were excluded by the judge as hearsay, because quite a lot of them were second-hand accounts of what Heard reported. This does not necessarily help her credibility, but it would have thrown Depp's into question. Included in her evidence were statements of:  Depp demonstrating obsessive/controlling tendencies around what she wore and how she interacted with her friends, trying to get her to forgo legally protecting herself with her own prenup and postnup lawyers, Depp admitting his drug addiction problems were more severe than he presented in the Fairfax trial, trying to bring Heard's physical and mental health care into his control (evidenced by the fact that he only would go to couple's therapy if it was a therapist he chose and paid for, rather than a neutral third party therapist), Heard maintaining her story that Depp's abuse is only as bad as it is because he surrounds himself with yes-men that he pays for, etc. That last point is why I personally looked at Depp's corroborating testimonies with  a side-eye, because in addition to wanting to protect Depp for personal reasons, most of his witnesses had at some point been paid by him or rely on his continued profitability. The points I mentioned is why I could never fully get onboard with Heard being 100% at fault, because whether either of them realized it or not, Depp had far too much control over her life AND has evidenced that he is not afraid to wield that influence to get his way.

Overall, trials are an intentionally imperfect source of evidence and people often overlook that fact due to implicit trust in due process. If more people had followed up with outside sources of information, or mainstream media had done a better job of contextualizing a lot of the trial process, the smear campaign against Amber would not have been as effective.",1,2024-10-14T18:29:54Z,2024-10-16T00:01:34Z

I learned about this case second hand from a friend who was giving me play by play details as they came out. Just hearing it through her biased lens I picked out that this was a smear campaign lead by the abuser. What I'd consider informed opinions formed after many years of work to understand my own past abusive relationship, she called projection. The negative celebrity news gossip about Depp Ive heard for the past decade was unreliable and stupid (as media consumed presominantly by queer/women typically is). The current news (which was totally /not/ celebrity gossip) she consumed about depp was informed and true.  I stopped talking to her after this, and I dont feel anger or resentment towards her.

I wonder if it's pointless to comment, because you're likely to just cast this pushback as red pill cope, but I gotta speak as a fan of yours. 

This is sloppy work. You don't need to Google snoop or read articles or contrive narratives about this specific case. Yes, lots of people did and yes some of the most cringe behavior came from the dusty incels. But bruh, you can watch the whole case. It's on this platform. I watched every minute on Emily Baker's channel (along with others). Whatever the weirdos did or said, a jury heard this case. She lost. The judge tacked on punitive damages. You understand how hard it is to win a defamation case as a public figure against another public figure? 

There's no need to attempt to fit this case into some broader pattern of memetic intellectual dishonesty when she had her day in real, actual court. Multiple times with multiple cases stemming from the relationship with Depp. 

I think this dialogue between you and these manosphere ppl (most of whom I only know from watching you) is having a very negative impact on your ability to parse some things. I fw you heavy, but you letting these ppl get you out of your intellectual pocket. Salute.

Edit 2: yeah having finished the vid, you're doing what the people you criticized did essentially. There's a reason ppl were quiet on this case from the left, and that's because a whole youtube community of legal experts and lawyers watched the case live and seen the facts and contextualized everything. I get what you saying about how nasty much of the discourse was and what pattern that fits into, but this is was just a stumbling, clumsy way to speak on it imho.",2,2024-10-14T18:27:21Z,2024-10-14T18:57:28Z

I never reported the violence, because ""men don't get abused"". The really sad thing is, she is still out there behaving this way - she ended up engaged to a friend in the UK & when it all went sideways, she did all the same stuff - which I find deeply sad - all these years & her psychological problems haven't improved a bit.
I can believe more than one thing, so I believe Johnny's cocaine & French wine problem could result in abuse. Also believe it is possible, Amber is like my ex.

It's very difficult to jump up to defend a woman who has come across as a bit of an undesirable character in court, and just lost her court case where she and her lawyers are meant to have convinced you that everything she is saying is true.  Now I did not come away thinking Johnny Depp is a squeaky clean and easy to live with guy, but I equally did not believe that he was the monster Amber tried to make out he was after their relationship ended.  I just have to live with the fact that I personally would not chose to date either of them.

However her self-proclaimed admission to being prone to violent outbursts and her detailing of several attacks on audio recordings while in therapy, while he goes on and on about those incidents were very telling. It painted a very damning story about her. In those scenarios the accused will almost always say ‚Äúwhat about x or y time you got violent and did this and this and this‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt the case. She admitted what she did on a therapists couch and did not counter with any equivalent accusations about him. Sure, she recalled indcidents at the trial, but that is the last place I‚Äôd expect honesty, when someone is being sued. She had plenty of time to craft a narrative. TBH the poop story is dumb and not a real concern. A slanted documentary is not a court where evidence is required.

IMO, the accusations of abuse were totally believable. Then after that, Depp *admitted* to abusive behavior in the UK trial. So by the time the US trial came around, it would have been hard to convince me that Amber was the real abuser especially since mutual abuse is not a thing.

I actually unsubed to a YouTube creator for their coverage of this trial. The topic of the trial was completely off-topic to their channel but they just had to make multiple videos to dunk on Heard and spread misinformation. F'ck that.",3,2024-10-14T18:11:29Z,2024-10-14T18:11:29Z

@cielmacca,"You're completely right, with only a few exceptions. The finger incident took place in a mansion in Australia. According to court transcripts of the audio recording that was running on Amber's phone for approximately five-ish hours, Depp caused about $50k damage to this house. He took a chunk out of a marble staircase, and his security discussed needing to resand the floors. 

But the fact of the case is that Depp's suit against Heard didn't even include any allegations of abuse, those (finger and poop) allegations were thrown in there as red herrings to discount and deprive attention of her own allegations. Obviously, it worked because society at large is genuinely misogynistic that they don't even realize that they'll take a man at his word, no matter how absurd that word is, over any woman's word that was backed by actual corroborating evidence.

I will say, however, saying Amber Heard is dislikable for dating another horrible man immediately after leaving an abusive relationship (she got with Elon within a month or two after leaving Depp) in which she was put in fear for her life isn't it, especially if you have a foundation in social work and an understanding of how trauma works, as you said you do.",53,2024-10-14T18:04:00Z,2024-10-14T18:18:19Z

@ResidentTarantino,"You kinda had me in the first half until you extended Anita Sarkeesian an olive branch. I'm just going to paste an extended tweet a Twitter friend of mine posted that kinda emphasizes how bad faith she was.

_So many people are taking this weird revisionist history stance with Sarkeesian, saying she was a good critic who got unjustly harassed for doing nothing but pointing out sexism in games, but honestly, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth._

_In reality, Sarkeesian has always been the definition of a grifter. She claimed to know loads about video games when she didn‚Äôt, used that perceived knowledge to accumulate over $125,000 for a series she never completed despite it being so very clearly low budget, essentially stealing money from her supporters, made definitively wrong statements about games to push an agenda about their supposed sexist overtones many of them simply didn‚Äôt have, inserted herself into the industry and affected it in negative ways we‚Äôre still feeling today, used the outrage generated from her misinformed takes and actions to spawn a media campaign so tenacious, she not only went on news outlets and to vidcon but the literal United Nations, and she continued that grift of outrage bait content talking about subjects she had little knowledge on to intentionally rile people up for the rest of her online career until it stopped working._

_To say she was an unjustly criticized martyr who had to deal with constant harassment from incels isn‚Äôt just a poor, incredibly generalized interpretation of what happened but literally falling into her hands, so she can justify to you why she‚Äôs perpetually the victim despite creating most of the negative attention she‚Äôs gotten on purpose._

_Is that to say every negative comment she‚Äôs ever gotten is justified? Of course not. But when you almost undeniably guide that attention towards you for the sake of victimhood so people wont criticize your grift, there‚Äôs really only so much I can personally feel bad for them._ (Braxton, ""Just Stop"" on YouTube)

And frankly, I blame her for why we have balding men in their 40's screeching about pronouns and gay people in games. Radical ignorance spawned radical malevolence.",2,2024-10-14T18:02:50Z,2024-10-14T18:03:38Z

@angeldelmoroable,"Well, i watched the trial for 6 weeks with legal commentary, if you watched the trial like i did, you would understand why people don't consider her a victim.
First of all, the trial wasn't about if Johnny Deep was an abuser, it was about if Amber Heard wrote the OPED about Johnny Deep allegedly abusing her, which she did, but kept lying about it.
Then we go to the ""proof"" she provided, which was either EXTREMELY useless, such as the ""bruises"" Johnny Deep gave her after hitting her with a ""big ring"" on his finger, and somehow there was no blood, any signs of the ring marks on her face, and it looked like she just apply a LIGHT layer of blush, or just proved that she was goading him into anger, as per the recording SHE gave the court.
Then we have Amber and her lawyers not rerspecting agreements made BEFORE starting the trial,
then Amber trying to use her less than stellar performance of sadness by trying to cry for .5 seconds without any tears and .1 second after said ""moment"" she got back to being completely fine,
her ""experts"" too being a mess,
and let's not forget, the trial literally STARTED with her best friend Eve Barlow being removed from the court because she was Live tweeting from the trial.
And don't forget there was already an incident in which Amber Heard wa sinvolved with an ex of hers...
If you didn't sit thorugh those 6 weeks watching the trial, you woulnd't understand the Agony experienced.

The point at the end the trial wasn't that Johnny Deep was a saint who could do no wrong, people with a brain just realized that both Johnny and Amber were Toxic towards each other, but somehow Amber was that tad bit worse becasue she was trying to gaslight people into believing Johnny was a monster and she wasn't.

Once again, people with a brain realized Amber had a hidden reason for going to the trial, which was to defame Johnny Deep FURTHER, while Johnny went to the trial to tell the truth about Amber writing the OPED about him, she sidelined the whole thing to tell the world once again that he abused her, and we saw the outcome.

Oh, and let me edit tp add that thrpughout the whole ""abuse"" thing, Amber and her friends were living in Johnny Deep's penthouse WITHOUT PAYING and had the nerve to call the police and saying Johnny was abusing her just to keep living off of him... but somehow we're supposed to believe she didn't have hidden reasons for how the whole thing was handled...",2,2024-10-14T17:55:26Z,2024-10-14T18:09:05Z

@nerdjournal,"I'm going to call cap here. As someone who was pretty defeated that Johnny Depp was such a violent abuser. I changed my mind on that after watching the trial. Not because of the reaction on social media. I can tell you specifically what pieces of evidence and which testimonies changed my mind into believing Johnny Depp. The first thing that made me curious was Amber's actual psychologist or psychiatrists. The one she actually used, and not the paid for Expert she used. She gave testimony of a case of Mutual abuse, only, she was very specific that Amber was the one who would initiate conflict and fights. That Amber would instigate violent altercations. That was the first thing that caught my eye, and when we pair that with the hours of recording of Amber calling Johnny a coward not because he would fight her, but literally because he wouldn't fight and would prefer to run away. That was step 2 to me wondering about the claims she was making, now we had her Psychiatrist saying she was the instigator and then hours of evidence of her saying the same thing. 

But I didn't want to eliminate her evidence or the concept that even if she started something, that it didn't mean Johnny Depp couldn't have taken it too far. However, at LEAST 2 images that she submitted as evidence were identical images that had been edited to make something look like it was signs of abuse. You can literally take these four images and two will overlay the other two images perfectly, proving they aren't separate images. One has standard lighting in which a small blemish that doesn't look like a bruise is visible, then in the other cop of the image the lighting has been altered to make the blemish look more like a bruise. So I have her psychiatrist saying yes, abuse existed, but she was the instigator. I have her on tape saying the same thing over and over again, and last I have clear proof that at least some evidence has been doctored. If the abuse case is real, why doctor any images? Unless you are trying to make something look worse than it is. The only other rumor of alleged abuse of a partner was also dispelled within the same trial. 

I just thought it was important to point out the main pieces of evidence that changed my mind. The piece of evidence that REALLY settled things for me wasn't actually allowed in the trial, but it was from the night of the ""alleged"" SA. The night she cut his finger off. That audio exists, go listen to it and listen to what she is saying. You tell me which story told in court actually lines up with the audio recording of later that night. I didn't base my opinion on social media, nor on the idiotic body language analysis guys. No, I based my opinion on the evidence that was actually presented and the concept of if you lie about something, I can assume you are lying about a lot more. 1) She tried to fake evidence. 2) She lied about writing on the mirror the night she was ""SA'd allegedly"" 3) Her own Psychiatrist said she was the one who instigated abuse. 4) the audiotapes submitted as evidences have only one common theme, that Amber wanted a punching bag, and she thought Johnny owed it to her to be that punching bag. And 5) The evidence that didn't make it to court, the audio from the most heinous allegations, do not showcase a woman who has been destroyed by this evil man. They showed someone who knew they had gone too far and cut their husband's firggin finger off, and she wasn't anywhere close to sober like she claimed she was. 


I can agree all day long that she was mistreated by the public during the trial, but I can not in good faith based on the actual evidence conclude that Johnny was this monster seeking to abuse. I think the truth is more in the middle, and it probably a LOT like her actual psychiatrist described it. That these were two incredibly toxic people for each other, and that they went about doing their best to destroy each other. I don't think any evidence proves that Johnny was trying to instigate abuse or that he regularly abused any of his girlfriends. I'm not going to use him getting into a fight in a bar 30 years ago as proof that he is a monster. I didn't base anything on her pooing or not pooping on a bed. Because I actually went into the American Trial undecided, but pretty sure Johnny had abused her. It was her testimony and her own psychiatrist that changed my mind. Also, the evidence Depp's team presented backed up her own psychiatrists recollections better than what Amber's story actually did. 

Anyway, personally, I think she was an abusive person, and she wanted a punching bag and then one day that punching bag broke and punched back and that probably isn't okay. It's nothing to root Johnny on for, but to take in ALL the evidence in its preponderance and to come across with him simply being an abuser, is ignoring a LOT of the actual evidence of the case. I think she pushed him too far, and he probably did lash out, but I don't think he was instigating abuse. I think he was being goaded into it. I think they were mutually horrible to each other, but I can't really square the reality that she did fake evidence and that every single audio literally disagree with what she said and agrees with Johnny and her own Psychiartists accounts.",3,2024-10-14T17:54:29Z,2024-10-14T17:54:29Z

@whalefall413,"Well, shit... I might have to rethink my opinion on the Heard Depp case. It's a good thing I do somewhat more research about things I learn now, but I wish I didn't take every strange story about Heard as near as fact. I took it as an example of false accusations on men and ran with that perspective. I still don't find Heard particularly likeable, but that shouldn't have stopped me from seeing that she was still being abused. 

Also, I'm shocked and impressed by how powerful the marketing campaign was to nearly erase Depp's misdeeds. Some amount of that of course came from good press with good, memeable moments from Depp's side (his lawyer for example looked like such a badass during every moment that we got to see) but a huge amount of that was of course the silence. I don't remember ever watching a video that was neutral, or pro Heard. Not knowing that I was asleep and having no one to wake me up, it makes a lot of sense that I became part of the ppl who felt that Depp was wronged.

@angellover02171,"What really sucks about this video is that you still don't know anything about Amber Heard. When she was in high school, she volunteered as part of her schools program. She liked volunteering so much that she volunteered with a chidrens hospital in LA. Amber also speaks Spainsh, and she volunteered to do tranlastion for people seeking to enter the US. She got an order of protection and divorce in 2016. Me Too was in 2017. The oped was published in 2018. 2018 was a mid term elevtion year.  In the divorce settlement, Amber had $7 million dollars given to the ACLU and a children's hospital in LA. The money was to be paid out over 10 years. Neither Depp nor Heard were supposed to talk about their divorce during. Depp was the first person to break their agreement for an interview. The op ed in question didn't call Depp and abuser, only that Heard represented abuse. There were two trials, one in the UK and one in Virginia. The UK trial was against the Sun magazing but relied on  Heard and friends and people that used to work with her. Out of 12 out of the 14 incidents that Heard recounted, 14 incidents of abuse, 12 were deemed to be credible. The Sun is allowed to call Depp a wife beater. Deep appealed, but the ruling was upheld. All of the information in the UK trial was submitted to the Virgina trial, but not all of it was allowed to be entered as evidence.

@alenyaus,"It was super disturbing when this was happening bc I'd kind of followed the story from 2016 when they initially divorced and it had been a pretty well documented case of spousal abuse from Depp to Heard. The 2020 trial was like, there were 3 spaces where people weren't spreading misinformation and mocking Amber (including mocking her testimony of SA) and one of those was like a text thread with my friend. Actually looking at facts and mentioning them, people would be like omg so you think every woman is innocent and don't care about abuse of men??!

It's also been interesting that a friend who mocked her over the fake shitting the bed story, later there was a very high profile spousal abuse case in her country that ended in the woman's death - at the trial many of the same bullshit was said about the victim and a number of women had the same reactions blaming her for her abuse. And said friend was like wow can you believe people can be like this. I wasn't petty about it bc ofc people change and it's a serious topic. Well maybe being petty to bring it up here.",6,2024-10-14T17:44:42Z,2024-10-14T17:44:42Z
@riverbanzachamploo9725,"Thank you for this video FD. I've been realizing this for a while. When the case first became public I didn't really look too much into it. But I was glad that a male victim were being taken seriously for chance. Since they have let down by everyone including the judicial system. Like the Mendez brothers for example. But I stopped looking into case after hearing that Amber was diagnosed with BPD and HPD. Tho I don't have HPD, I do habe Bpd one of if not the most, stigmatized disorders of all time. So seeing people use Amber to further the stigmatization, made me loose interest in the case. Cuz now everything I saw said ""typical borderline abuser"". But I still  believed what the media was saying about Amber and didn't understand why anyone would defend her. I felt so bad for Johnny but after doing my own research on the case instead of just what I saw in the media, learning about reactionary abuse, and the ""perfect"" victim complex. It was clear as day not just that Johnny was the abuser and Amber was the victim, but that Johnny had a problematic history that conviently was never addressed. But I had a hard time saying this without being attacked for being misanderist. I find it kinda ironic because there was so much misogyny at play as to why Amber was treated the way she was. How her every action was picked apart by the media, and she had her diagnosis used against her, while Johnny's hears of abusive behavior was just glossed over. They didn't even bother to check him for any mental disorders even tho he has shown clear traits and symptoms. This case reminds me sm of the OJ Simpson case. Just like how black men usually get wrongfully convicted, male victims of domestic abuse usually never get justice. But this was not one of thoes times. The victim who actually needed justice was abandoned by socitey while their aggressors got away with it.",6,2024-10-14T17:44:06Z,2024-10-14T17:44:06Z

@mutantmagnet,"I get B Sides is supposed to different from your regular content but this felt really scattershot even compared to other B Sides.

Princess Weekes has been talking about the Heard Depp case a lot but she was getting a lot of push back from even leftist and liberal spaces. 


Before the case became mainstream leftists were initially against Depp and as more information came out they began to turn against Heard.


How many other black voices would've ben sufficient to reexamine this case?


As for breadtube in general Ellis touched on the case directly in the great Yoko expose but Munecat did not in any content I consume by her so far.


I was coming into this video wondering how you would challenge my own views on this case but you pretty much didn't want to engage with the substance of the specifics just to make a point that it's not being discussed enough...

Out of all of breadtube content so far I found Princess Weekes comparison to a relationship in South Park to the Depp Heard dynamics insightful especially in understanding what isn't mutual abuse.

@cherrypopscile3385,"Imma be real, as someone without the full context who is just trying to understand what actually happened and who has near 0 knowledge about the Depp Heard case:

The part in Lindsay Elises Yoko video was trash. Im sorry but it (to me) basically was just ""How can anyone be so stupid as to believe this. We'd have to believe a small woman was able to do all this to believe Depp [Scrolls a list by that you'd have to pause to actually read]""

It had this air of ""I don't actually wanna explain this thing, but let me bring it up every 10 minutes while still not explaining actually what happened "". Maybe its because, again, I know basically nothing about this case, but I'm not pausing to read a list then fact checking the entire list to learn the basics of something you keep bringing up every ten minutes.

@kijah9622,I was like 17 when this case came out and the first time I saw anything was about how amber heard was an abusive piece of shit and poor Johnny. That really shaped how I thought about this case. I tried my best to watch neutral videos on the topic. However I won‚Äôt lie for a while I thought Johnny Depp was the victim. What made me question myself is when I had a conversation with a friend and surprisingly twitter. Despite my thoughts on the matter I avoided liking things on the court because despite my thoughts I didn‚Äôt want to be wrong and support something that could hurt the true victim. However the guilt I felt when I realized I was being biased hurt like a bitch.  That‚Äôs why I just started avoiding it. Though I will say the amount of misinformation I heard was astounding.

@medusonegirl,"Omg, thanks for the shoutout! I'm so glad you were willing to make this video and apologize for your (or your editor's) previous joke. In making my videos on DvH, I had to watch clips of a lot of content creators who I otherwise respected making some very shameful commentary on the case. Not to excuse the joke you made, but your name was still toward the bottom of the list of creators that I think actually owe Amber Heard an apology and I hope your willingness to take accountability for a comparatively tiny contribution to the Amber Heard hate-train encourages others to look back at some far more harmful commentary from 2022.

I do agree that there was a perception of Amber's plight being an example of ""white feminism."" I received plenty of comments from Johnny Depp supporters dismissing my commentary as ""a white woman coming to the defense of another white woman"" (conveniently leaving out the fact that I was defending her against a white man).

Despite it being at the core of Amber's counterclaims (and everyone insists they ""watched the trial"" üôÑ), people don't realize the extent to which the online rhetoric surrounding the case was specifically orchestrated by Johnny's team. His lead attorney from the UK case literally admitted to leaking information about Amber to what he called ""Internet Journalists"" (aka, alt-right YouTubers and conspiracy theorist bloggers) prior to the trials; and there's been quite a lot uncovered in the last year about bot campaigns Johnny's team very clearly utilized for years leading up to 2022.

Who's to say what talking points were organic in all the conversations surrounding the case and what was planted by bad-actors, but certainly Johnny's team benefitted from people wildly overestimating the amount of power and privilege Amber Heard had. Emphasizing Amber's whiteness was a part of that to an extent, but at least for that, Amber Heard is, in fact, white and does therefore benefit from white privilege. What was far more absurd was the idea held by many leftists that this case didn't represent legitimate problems in our society and shouldn't be paid attention to because both people involved in it were just some rich celebrities, despite Amber Heard never being all that rich nor that famous.

In the year of their divorce, she had a net income of just over $50,000, while Johnny had made several million dollars that same year; and as you admitted at the beginning of this video, before you started doing more research, you wouldn't have been able to pick Amber out from a line-up of other random blonde actresses. Outside of her relationship with Johnny, she was barely a celebrity (perhaps in part because of her relationship with Johnny as he was incredibly restrictive of what professional opportunities she could even pursue while they were together and the negative attention she received after their divorce has definitely not helped her). But propping Amber up as an ultra-privileged famous rich white woman was a great tool to downplay the severe power imbalance that laid the foundation for the abuse in her marriage, as well as mitigate the amount of empathy certain sections of the Internet would be willing to show her in her legal battles against her far more powerful ex.

That being said, on the claim that ""there was a genuine lack of black attention paid toward [Amber's] case,"" I have to say, as someone who's been pretty involved with pro-Amber Heard circles for over a year, I think the statement should maybe be amended to say there was a genuine lack of black *male* attention. Many of the earliest public defenders of Amber Heard have been black women‚Äìwhich makes sense as black women are statistically more likely to be the victims of domestic violence‚Äìbut not only have many of their contributions been overlooked within the larger discourse because their voices are consistently undervalued outside of this one conversation, many of them have also been far more severely targeted by pro-Johnny Depp harassment campaigns which have unfortunately muffled if not full-out silenced many advocates.

@Inturvertle,"I think you should have watched the trial before posting this video. You got some facts of the case wrong. 
I watch the whole trial from beginning to end. To ignore/dismiss the mountain of evidence against amber heard does a disservice to this conversation.
Amber heard was believed to first, That's the whole reason Johnny Depp lost Disney and a went quiet. Then he sued her. 
During the trial most of the evidence provided to find her at fault, were her own videos and recording (there were alot, too many to ignore). Also the other people in her past, before Johnny Depp, who have reported on her violence behavior. Or even amber heards sister who's cast members were worried that her bruises came from amber hurting her, and were openly concerned. 
I think the people in the black community didn't side with her because   she was clearly not telling the truth. She lied a lot, even before the trial she lied about donate he alimony to charity. I think the charity is still waiting for the check.

@FlyGravitas,"No one can fault you for knowing which side your Bread-tube is buttered on, yt women pay your bills. But people don't hate Amber Heard because she was an imperfect victim of abuse (Most people can clearly see that both, her and Depp had severe substance abuse and mental health issues that exacerbated their already toxic dynamic.) People hat her because she lied in ways that tried to villainize the man purely for the sake of retaliatory action and to embarrass him, while mobilizing a movement and Garner support of women who were vocalizing their abuse stories. She did so in a way that was exploitative of the movement, in service to her own career and fame, while simultaneously trying to ruin another person's career, by saying he was a horrible abuser, when she was just as horrible, if not worse, in her proactive and aggressive tactics to exert control, often through verbal, emotional and physical violence.

@joeodd2,"Great video. I'm still not convinced their relationship was one-sided abuse. But, I admit that I have my personal bias based on situations in my personal life that made me more sympathetic to Depp over Heard. That said, I think you cherry-picked a bit when it came to the evidence. I'll grant you that the dog poop and cut finger stories are questionable at best, but you did not address the most damning evidence against Heard. 

The police report and TMZ photo op that took place before she wrote the op-ed were what really sunk her case. I remember her trying to explain while on the witness stand how she carried a ""bruise kit,"" before hurriedly clarifying that she didn't use it the same way they use it in movies to create bruises. It didn't help that the photos of her bruises were taken after she was examined by police officers and healthcare professionals, who said they did not observe those injuries. 

Another thing that I believe rubbed a lot of people the wrong way was her ""Mother Theresa"" persona when it came to her motivations for writing the article. She's an experienced actress in Hollywood and knew that such an article would have a dramatic impact on Depp's career. To say that she had no intention of ever ""hurting Johnny"" just didn't ring true. If he was a horrible monster who put you through hell, it's only natural to want to hurt him back. Instead, she tried to portray herself as the ""ambassador"" of all abused women. She literally tried to MLK herself, and the public smelled bullshit. 

The sad thing is that I do believe Depp is a deeply troubled man with a lot of demons who more than likely engaged in physical, psychological, and perhaps even sexually abusive behavior. The problem is that his ""victim"" likely engaged in some of those same behaviors, and not in the retaliatory sense. You can go back to the story of Heard allegedly abusing her ex-girlfriend in an airport. 

I think the truth of this situation dwells in a grey area that most of us don't have the time, nor inclination to sift through. This is why I think most people call it a ""toxic relationship"" and leave it at that. Whether or not that's fair, we may never know. Amber Heard could have legitimately been terrorized by Depp, and she could have also been abusive.

As for Depp, I think he did what most people would do in that situation, as he would have been canceled, the same as Kevin Spacey and Bill Cosby. He lost his most iconic role and will probably never get it back, but at least his work won't be de-platformed. 

There is definitely a broader conversation to be had when it comes to powerful men getting the benefit of the doubt, more so than female accusers. The ""perfect victim"" issue in this case almost reminds me of what happened with Rosa Parks. Claudette Colvin was arrested before Rosa Parks for doing the same thing, but because she had darker skin and became pregnant a year later when she was 16, her case was not used to fuel the Civil Rights Movement.",0,2024-10-14T17:24:03Z,2024-10-14T17:24:03Z

For one with the finger incident amber dosnt just say that  they got into a argument. Amber claims she was brutally beaten and dragged and violated with a wine bottle inside her. And during all that Johnny damaged his own finger.
 But there is evidence that frankly goes against this  happening. She claims in another incident shes was beaten so badly she broke her nose and got her lip spilt but shes on a james corden interview like a day later and shes fine. And recorded audio of that night where amber is apologetic  and seems to be walking around completely fine in this secret recording (presumably made by heard)  there is no  mention of amber being injured in any shape or form.

Cuz the poop thing was just funny,  the finger missing was concerning but the issue I had with Amber was the abuse she claimed to have received was so excessive and pictures days after with no swelling, and I've seen what a face beating looks like, example Rhianna. I didn't believe her for that. I never thought Jonny was a perfect but Amber, to me, came off as an opportunist co-opting the Me Too movement. NO victim is perfect but this one gave me serious doubts. I'm definitely don't mind having my bias views be challenged but for me the reason I seriously did not like Amber Heard was cuz she comes off as very unlikeable in the trial with questionable evidence. I didn't see Jonny Depp as an innocent victim but a mutual contributer to the abusive dynamics. Amber Heard just seemed to be the one with a better motive in painting herself a victim. I also just don't see myself coming back to my abusive partner when I already claimed he abused me. That was the nail in the coffin ‚ö∞Ô∏è for me.

@whateva4eva688,"I‚Äôm going to get dragged to hell, but I truly want to have an engaging conversation because this case is so important for so many reasons. I believe both Amber and Johnny have severe trauma related issues from childhood that manifest in two different ways. Johnny gets a pass because we let men get away with their transgressions because we are conditioned to. Amber lives with the sin of being an ‚Äúunlikeable‚Äù woman. I don‚Äôt think she is the person she tried to portray herself on the stand. She took no accountability for anything and tried so much to come across as the victim. I understand people will say that is because she‚Äôs the victim, but as a person, we should all be able to see how we contributed to situations to make them worse. I do see her as a person who tried to make herself better by going to therapy and work on herself but refused to see how contributed to the toxicity. But she has admitted in the recordings that she gets mad and it gets worse when it doesn‚Äôt go her way. She had a fear of abandonment and Johnny hated to be confronted negatively and would leave,making Amber feel so much worse. He is severely immature and would throw insults, she would physically assault him when tried to leave. THEY KEPT THEIR RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THEY BOTH WERE PROJECTING WHAT THEY WANTED THE OTHER TO BE FOR THEM. Johnny wanted arm candy for events, Amber wanted a better footing with casting agents. They both used each other for what they thought could benefit themselves. 

They both engaged in a smear campaign because they live and die by the PR machine. Amber ruminated in a therapy session about filing for a restraining order to get the upper hand in the divorce. That therapist testified to that. I believed she tried to craft a beneficial exit strategy for her and it immediately got called out for it, because while Johnny is a drunk, emotionally abusive piece of shit, I don‚Äôt think he actually assaulted her. But his career is over because of  that accusation. So, for a dumb tit for tat, the poop story is crafted so Amber is always know as Amber Turd. 

I have empathy for Amber in the sense that she is a product of abusive childhood household, being constantly belittled or undermined for being an attractive woman. I want with my whole being to want to believe her account, but I just can‚Äôt. Unfortunately, I think she‚Äôs an example of how narcissism can destroy someone if they go unchecked. Johnny is a very successful example of how narcissism can be placated if you have a ton of money. They had battling egos and in the end, they both burned each other to the ground. 

Maybe in a few years, complex women with anger issues can be reviewed through a different lens, and maybe she writes a wonderful memoir about her life to give us a better understanding of the relationship. She was in a toxic emotionally and psychologically abusive relationship, but her public claims and what she got sued for was over physical abuse. In order for the public to ‚Äúside‚Äù with her, she has to be accountable for the lie. Her best move is to say ‚ÄúI fucked up, but here are the reasons why I did it.‚ÄùAnd maybe we grant her the grace we give men when they fuck up.",4,2024-10-14T17:12:16Z,2024-10-14T17:12:16Z

@redleader4277,"Thanks for this video.
Some of us were defending and supporting Amber on social media during the height of the abusive smear campaign against her by Depp and the Youtubers who were in direct contact with his lawyer. Most people seem to not even know Johnny Depp lost a libel case in the UK in 2020 about him being called a ""wife beater"" when the Newspaper he sued, proved overwhelmingly that he had abused her, and the Judge agreed.

Commonsense went out the window and people were willing to believe the craziest lies about her, from her shitting on a bed to, snorting cocaine on the stand, stealing lines from movies. 

Depp and his lawyers got away with so many lies and shady behaviour. His lawyer Cmaile was bragging about how she would spray the cologne of Depp on the chair Amber was using for depositions in order to ""play mind games"" as she said. Camile got evidence excluded then brazenly lied and said it didn't exist.

@billbill6094,"Goddamn did not know that about the suffragettes. Stuff like that is why I hate the ""don't judge people of the past based on morals of today"" excuse, because it's only ever used to encourage a simplification and therefore a whitewashing of history that blinds us to the trends of today that are directly built on them. It directly ignores the perspectives of the oppressed who I'm sure would've thought of their oppressors as immoral, and brews misunderstandings about certain actions were accepted in time periods where they weren't.

Apparently we're allowed to judge people today by the morals of today (unless we like how good they act or sing), but how am I supposed to do that if I can't form my morals from the actions of yesterday? I'm supposed to celebrate suffragettes lobbying for woman's voting rights but cannot equally admonish them for lobbying against black women's voting rights?

It was like a paradigm shift where you started thinking ""so none of you actually do care about justice and men?""

Ever since then, I've opted to not look into the trial or the people around it because I just didn't want to find myself at an impasse with all of the leftists and progressives I agree with on 95% of all topics.

@sweetie_babie,"I wanna say a few things:

1) mutual abuse does not exist. That is corroborated by several experts in the field. Abuse requires a power imbalance, and there is none when a dynamic of two BOTH feel comfortable harming each other. 

2) while it was a media circus and there are several unexplained instances of Johnny hurting Amber, there is a reason, past JUST misogyny, that people (myself included) did not believe Amber's testimony. 

I say this as a firm believer in women's rights,  me too, and as a woman myself who has experienced SA and abusive dynamics. 

The timeline of events that Amber presented did not match up, the photos she introduced into evidence as pictures of separate injuries from different abuse instances were clearly the same picture but cropped and edited, she admitted on tape that she had hit Johnny and looked for confrontation after he walked away, she too has a history of domestic violence, and her answers to unexplained instances on her end were either ""i don't know"" or went against witness testimony.

There is a LOT of grace to give to victims,  even people saying she was ""acting poorly"" on the stand to say she was lying or pointing out that the makeup she testified to using didn't exist at the time of the abuse are easily explained away. Victims misremember the little details, and not everyone reacts to trauma in the way people expect. But there was something off with her defense beyond the victim blame-y, misogyny of Depp defenders.

I don't think we'll ever truly know who abused who or if it was just a plain toxic relationship where both equally felt comfortable and empowered to beat on the other (which i personally lean toward), but i just want to point out there were parts of the trial on BOTH sides that deservedly give people pause.",4,2024-10-14T17:00:34Z,2024-10-14T17:00:34Z

@BiggerinRealLife,"Thank you for this. I wasn‚Äôt hurt or offended by the initial joke, but I will share that the Herd/Depp trial messed me up and I stepped away from watching coverage as even some of my most beloved commentators fell into the myth that is the idea of ‚Äúmutual abuse.‚Äù While the trial was going on, I was in the middle of ending an 18 year abusive marriage. It was like watching what my life was going to be like if I ever stepped out of line if I didn‚Äôt keep up the copacetic co-parenting thing where he‚Äôs a good guy and we just want different things, because I‚Äôm a confrontational person who married a passive guy. So my reaction to abuse was fighting back. No one who hasn‚Äôt lived in this dynamic can understand how absolutely crazy it makes you; being emotionally manipulated against your own best instincts, and gaslit that you‚Äôre always the problem because you dare to bring things up that aren‚Äôt working for you and you want to fix it. Add to that screaming, which literally causes your brain to malfunction‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a mess. I‚Äôve done things to my ex that I am not proud of. That absolutely should be seen as abusive. I was also acting out against a severely toxic situation that everyone in my life seemed invested in making me stay stuck in, until I literally had to burn down our world so I could make it out alive. Mutual abuse is a myth: there is always a primary abuser. And when that abuser doesn‚Äôt hit, or do anything that would make it obvious, it makes victims feel crazy. And some of us bite back. Honestly even thinking about that trial now makes me sick. So thank you for wading back into the muck that is this mess for an apology that probably wasn‚Äôt necessary, but incredibly valuable nonetheless.",0,2024-10-14T16:59:46Z,2024-10-14T16:59:46Z

@sophiaoconnell1927,As someone who tried to be a voice of clarity at the time I can say in my decade and a half online I‚Äôve never felt such vitriol in response. People using any other narrative as proof that society doesn‚Äôt care about men being abused and accusations of feminist brain rot. I think people genuinely don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the sort of backlash a video trying to rectify public perception would cause. It genuinely felt like the full force of the patriarchy was behind it has some sort of revenge for me too.

@whodatboi2567,"I think you're not acknowledging how a large reason why people were against Amber Heard was because of the audio and how damaging it was to her public perception as she pretty much admitted to hitting Johnny Depp and she came off remorseless and callous when confronted about it. It went beyond the usual framing of the imperfect victim that many women like Meg The Stallion experience because of not being ""socially pure"" and pretty much had her perceived as a confirmed violent perpetrator. The fact that the best-case scenario (and I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who hasn't looked into the case and acknowledge I could be wrong about the facts) was the relationship being the case of mutual abuse made it hard for most people to defend her as they would have to be defending an abuser; with most people usually used to coming to the defense of the innocent or seemingly innocent.",6,2024-10-14T16:50:50Z,2024-10-14T16:50:50Z
@keepingitkianatural,"I'm so glad that you decided on this topic. Facinating paradoxes at play in these dynamics. I hope I don't sound crazy, but I've long noticed there is an interesting intersection that ww exist in that leaves them more than a bit vulnerable to abuse. Because there IS a documented history of ww falsely accusing BM, that history is then used to wholesale dismiss any allegation made by a ww. Look at Kobe, Nate Parker, Jonathan Majors,  and OJ. All of the allegations were promptly dismissed as lies based on identity alone. I've always felt so bad that these women should be believed, but have felt like.... ""maybe, I'm falling for it, maybe this is another Central Park 5 or Emmett Till situation?"" Even when the logic doesn't line up, it lingers. I literally remember people of all races calling Amber a Karen for speaking up about her own abuse. To watch WM plainly take advatage of the very racial/gender  dynamics that THEY originally weaponized to start with... it's another lesson in intersection and the insidiousness of patriarchy and yt supremacy. Everything bends to the favor of the oppressor (unless you're a woman, then not always). That's why we must constantly interrogate our beliefs and challenge our assumptions.

@StoutShako,"I still don't know how I feel about this case tbh. The thing that turned me off from Amber Heard is the fact that she admitted to striking Johnny and laughing about it. And how she tracked him down in another country to try to ""make up"" for it when he made it clear he wanted nothing to do with her. The way she was staring him down also didn't sit right with me. Like, she honestly just came off as super aggressive, and I was fully expecting to side with her, because I do generally believe abuse victims off rip and I'm severely distrustful of powerful men in general.

For me, it's not about there being a ""perfect victim"". Like, why couldn't Johnny be considered an imperfect victim if she was the one instigating a lot of it? To me, there is a huge difference between someone like Heard and someone like Anita Hill or that woman who testified against Kavanaugh (I forgot her name). To me, this was about admitting that males could be victims of abuse from women, as well, and it should be treated just as seriously. 

I don't doubt that their relationship was super toxic and that they basically were abusive and codependent on each other. That relationship was bad for everyone involved. But I don't think it was all on Johnny, and I don't trust many people who do. 

I remember watching a video on YT about the Tiger Woods incident where his wife found out she was cheating on him and flew into a rage, attacking him with a golf club. In the video, it was portrayed as a cartoonish joke, but the whole time I was just thinking ""Oh my god, she literally could have killed him???"" I don't get why when a woman does something like that, it's portrayed as funny or generally not a big deal, but if the tables were turned and Tiger had attacked his cheating spouse with golf clubs, he would probably still be in jail today.

Again, this isn't to take away from how a lot of victims feel about this and all the body language bs was straight nonsense. I only looked at her actions and decided I didn't like what I saw.",4,2024-10-14T16:50:11Z,2024-10-14T16:50:11Z

@farrellanna,"I watched the whole trial.  There is so much you‚Äôve left out it feels like it has to be intentional.  You mention how media focused on Amber being the abuser, ignoring the fact that for years before the trial, before JD decided to start fighting back, the world was on her side.  She was the poster girl for DV survivors, speaking at rallies and going on talk shows.  For at least two years if I remember correctly.  Once he broke his silence and the evidence started coming out, that‚Äôs when people began to realize there was more going on.   

There were experts for both parties and you seem to have completely ignored Depp‚Äôs experts in favor for Amber‚Äôs.  On top of that you left out the fact that she admits on tape to abusing him.  They recorded their conversations.  She calls him a baby for complaining about being slapped (he says she punched him and she says it wasn‚Äôt a punch because her fist wasn‚Äôt closed), how no one will believe him if he tells them what she did cause he‚Äôs a man and she‚Äôs smaller than him.  The way she talks about her own actions was what made me realize she was the abuser in the relationship, it made my stomach hurt and my heart ache listening to them.  I don‚Äôt know how anyone could listen to those tapes in full and walk away thinking Amber was a victim in that relationship.

There‚Äôs a lot more I could go into but you already stated in your video your mind is made up.  Normally I really appreciate the time and energy you put into explaining things, you‚Äôre one of my favorite creators even if I don‚Äôt always understand what you‚Äôre talking about but I do know this topic and your take is a bad one.",3,2024-10-14T16:48:17Z,2024-10-14T17:09:40Z

@dafnifez,"Much respect to you for this. I do wish such realizations and videos came sooner but man, am I glad they're coming out now!

For me, it was obvious from the beginning of the trial that Amber Heard was the victim and Depp the abuser. That's why it has always been insane to me that so many people failed to see his smear campaign and his act in court, especially given the insane amounts of evidence Amber had. In addition, there's even a whole 129-page document by one of the highest judges in the UK explaining exactly why he believes Depp physically abused Amber Heard at least 12 times, sexually abused her at least once, and put her in fear of her life at least three times! And the document was reviewed by two more senior judges who both ruled that 2020 trial to have been ""full"" and ""fair.""

So, again, thank you for using your platform to  bring the grave injustice that Amber was subjected to to light.

However, I'd like to push back on your ""I don't like Amber Heard"" narrative. It seems to me that your dislike, like most people's, is based on a superficial understanding of her life that not take into account the numerous acts of activism that she's been engaged in for most of her life - stretching back to her childhood. Please take some time to learn about who she is before forming any concrete opinions on who she is as a person. If you do, you'll find that her character is way above the kind that you see in most people, not just Hollywood celebes.

@ginomoscati1976,"We let Johnny get away with it because we watched the trial and understood that her accusations were not supported by the little evidence she submitted.  

Amber Heard is a pariah in Hollywood, and if you think Johnnys big executive friends would realign themselves with him if her accusations came across as being true and genuine on the stand, you‚Äôre delusional.  

She lost her own case.  Her lawyers helped.  You can‚Äôt have watched the trial and come to any other conclusion.  Of course the abuse in the relationship went both ways, but Amber was the primary aggressor in every recorded interaction submitted in evidence and we let Johnny off the hook because her version of events was designed to destroy him, did not match her evidence, and her complete lack of accountability for her own actions does not help her credibility.

@dfghjklkjhgfdsa,"Look, I‚Äôm never going to feel too bad for Amber Heard. It‚Äôs just not going to happen. Because she has screwed over lots of victims by lying. Because she did lie, she lied a lot, which cast what she said that was the truth in doubt. If she just told the truth, it‚Äôd be solid and Depp would have gotten checked. Depp was almost certainly emotionally and verbally abusive from the go, and he probably didn‚Äôt start anything physical until she started it up. Because Depp has a history of destructive douchebaggery, mostly property damage and being a controlling asshole partner. But until he met Amber, he seemed to be very careful to not get violent with people because of his own abuse. She told impossible tales and she probably didn‚Äôt have to. Maybe she felt the need to expand it because she was also being abusive and aggressive towards him and didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd get support if they were seen as equally abusive so she inflated it? Videos by Amber Heard supporters make me uncomfortable, I‚Äôm not going to lie. Mostly because they tend to bring up very specific issues while ignoring all the shit that she did. It feels like they are bulldozing over all the female victims who spoke out about how Amber‚Äôs behavior didn‚Äôt match with their experiences, or how she reminded them of their abusers. The fact that Depp got a slide for his bullshit is terrible but the idea that people feel to need to vindicate another piece of shit to do it is insane to me.

  And honestly, your take on The Finger Incident is a bit‚Ä¶ shaky, not gonna lie. Like I get it, because it really is a he said she said, but not even for the reasons you listed. For one thing, his finger being a crush injury isn‚Äôt a point for Amber‚Äôs story, because punching the phone on the wall probably wouldn‚Äôt crush one single finger tip, so much as like‚Ä¶ break a bunch of his fingers and slice up his hands. But if that finger tip was where a thrown bottle landed? I could see crushing. But there could be details of their stories that I‚Äôm forgetting‚Ä¶ but the second thing! With the walls, that comes off as potentially victim blaming, tbh. Johnny was heavily intoxicated and has a long history of mental issues, he‚Äôs not going to react normally to an assault like that. His being drunk or high doesn‚Äôt make him less able to have had something thrown at him, I‚Äôd say it might make it more likely, especially if Amber was in a similar boat. For me it‚Äôs not a stretch that someone so angry and also so confrontation adverse (a la all the audio we have of him, you know, trying to flee?) and so unwell in his head, might lock himself away and write insults on the wall towards the person who just mutilated him is that was indeed what happened. Like, that‚Äôs really fucked, but it‚Äôs not crazy out of the realm of human behavior. But I will admit that is one situation where Amber might have been tell mostly the truth, but because whatever happened might have been lied about, as victims have been known to do when doctors ask about an injury that needs treating, it comes down to a he said she said. But maybe that‚Äôs just me.",1,2024-10-14T16:30:44Z,2024-10-14T16:30:44Z
@afromarxistbodyguard,"The slippery slope when it comes to discussing women as abusers or not is that it commits the same essentializing fallacy of ""men are inherently violent"" but of course gets weaponized against feminism and women in general - patriarchal society institutionalized violence.

Depp's wrongdoings weren't as widely publicized as Amber's. It felt like there was a misogynist bias against Amber Heard while Johnny was favored. Narrative control is extremely important because it influences people's opinions. 

An example is the whole Kendrick v Drake beef. The narrative was that Kendrick was a hero beefing with Drake to expose and save the industry. In reality he did it for his ego to win a rap battle, nothing wrong about that though. He brought Dr Dre on his latest show. Dr Dre dated a 16 year old when he was 22 and be@t women viole ntly. He featured Kodak and brought him on tour while implying on his album that he could be redeemed. Kodak was charged for r@pe. He brought Smacc TDE on his latest show who was a former pimp. If he was really trying to be a morally righteous guy then he would call out these guys and the whole industry that he hinted was doing some shady sh!t in his song.

@seri-ously8591,"The only one I seen so far that highlighted Amber Heard's case was Lindsey Ellis and it was mentioned in her Yoko video.

I think that the reason way the Heard-Depp trial panned out the way it did was entire due to the year long public exposure of Depp's career. He was painted out to be that tragic genius male actor. So people unconsciously lean on him into that. On top of the fact that there was a push from the same progressive side showcasing that men are also victims of sexual assault around that year. 

More or less, Heard had everything against her in the court of public opinion because of how the medias covering said trial portrayed her as. Focusing entirely on her physical actions and giving the age old argument of her being hysteria. On top of alt-right grifters on various platforms reacting to the trial and giving their own interjections.

The recording of her saying no one would believe a man could be a victim if he came forward swayed a lot of people.  We don't know the context of that conversation. He could've been threatening to lie about her, who knows. The one where she admitted she had a habit of hitting him during arguements was pretty cut and dry.  Her theatrics on the stand and refusal to acknowledge her own addiction/aggression issues worked against her as well. He was caught saying terrible things in the recordings as well, but he's had decades of media training and knows how to work a crowd. It wasn't a fair fight on the optics front.

There was a lot sketchy stuff in the trial.  Both sides presented inconsistent evidence. An apology to her is 100% warranted, but at least SOME accountability should remain.

@TomMinnow,"Appreciate you making this. My mom forced me to listen to the recording of an argument between Depp and Heard, she was attempting to demonstrate how ""insane"" Heard sounded. Listening to that recording, I was taken back to arguments with my ex, where I was disoriented, exhausted, at my wits end trying to make him understand what he was doing to me, meanwhile he was calm and contemptuous. Being with abusors is maddening. They want you to believe exactly as you said: that every reaction to their abuse is proof that they're the real victim. They weild uncertainty, benefit of the doubt and the love you have for them against you. Exactly as I've seen Depp do with the public and Heard.
I can't imagine the emotional turmoil this has been for Heard, regardless of my personal distaste for her outside this context. She had to break through the belief that she deserved his treatment to leave him. Then she had to go through that self loathing and shame all over again when the public decided she was a villain.",216,2024-10-14T16:14:52Z,2024-10-14T16:22:18Z
@fancyorangemittens,"THANK YOU. 

This never should have been brought to civil court. She did not lie or defame. I am not pro Amber Heard, but I know Johnny Depp is a liar and an abuser. Amber Heard probably did harmful things, to him and to other people in the past-- that doesn't mean she was the abuser in this situation, nor did she deserve the public hate/harassment. More than anything, I hate how this case has impacted the overall conversation about domestic abuse. It hurts survivors who want to come forward, and disproportionately impacts the men who are subject to abuse. While I understand that men are less often abuse victims (according to current statistics, which, even if they were perfect would still reflect that women and children are most often subject to this kind of abuse), they never get justice or help. This whole cultural event has set a horrific precedent. Abusers should not be able to sue and terrorize their survivors. 
Things were already bad enough-- I had a survivor advocate laugh in my face (literally) when I was trying to find resources for a father trying to leave his physically abusive wife so he could keep custody of his kids. This is an urban NDN context, just as an aside. There is no doubt that this was a hate campaign orchestrated by a very good actor, and the only person it helped was Johnny Depp. 
I am sick to death of talking to people who want to act like Amber is somehow a perfect angel. Victims are imperfect... they shouldn't have to be perfect to be believed, but being subject to abuse also doesn't excuse your own behavior. I can't speak to Amber Heard's innocence with the finger thing or her past situations, but it is kinda irrelevant. I don't think there is any use to portraying people as demons and saints in these situations, and it is wild that so many people can't accept anything else.",1,2024-10-14T16:14:38Z,2024-10-14T16:14:38Z

@snoopy104,"We got the mutual abuse narrative because that's what the jury found (they found both Depp and Heard liable of defamation regarding their statements about the other). I watched the trial mostly because I enjoy watching trials not because I had a beef with either Depp or Heard. It was very clear from the trial that neither person was an amazing specimen of human nature. That said, the jury also awarded punitive damages against Heard because (I'm guessing) they believed as I did that she was lying about parts of her testimony. Her testimony didn't match the physical evidence. It didn't match the timeline evidence. It didn't match the testimony of her own witnesses. Depp, on the other hand, admitted many (perhaps not all, but many) of the bad things he'd done both against Heard and in general. His testimony was also much better collaborated by the other evidence, both the evidence that his team presented but also the evidence that Heard's team presented. It seemed more like she was trying to cash in on the MeToo movement than actually using it to escape herself. MeToo movement supporters turned on her for that reason. I have not followed events since (since again I cared more about the trial than the conflict itself), so I don't know what the Depp crowd or the Heard crowd have done since. Personally, I feel both should be left alone.

As to Depp ""getting away with it"", his career was deeply impacted by the trial and related events. His acting career is still running on fumes, and his music career while still going, is on a much smaller scale than before.",4,2024-10-14T16:10:33Z,2024-10-14T16:10:33Z

@marcusmiller4986,I understand what Unc is saying but it's hard for me to agree with him. As someone who actually looked at/heard most of that trial while it was happening the things that Unc pointed out aren't even the things that stuck with me (the bed and the finger). It was the recordings of their interactions. It was tough for me to listen to and say she wasn't being abusive as well. There's a reason she lost the case and I don't think it's because anyone thinks that Johnny wasn't abusive. I think because after listening to all that testimony it was reasonable to think that they were being abusive to each other.,0,2024-10-14T16:00:58Z,2024-10-14T16:00:58Z

@RLane-xz5cj,"It was actually a Hazbin Hotel video that made me question the narrative on the Amber Heard case. I was already in the mind of it being ""complicated"" but then an episode review made a one off joke of calling the objectively nasty and abusive character Stella ""Amber Bird"" (who's husband in the show is flawed, but absolutely the victim in his relationship with her), and the joke felt so tasteless that I whole sale stopped watching that YouTuber. It was just gross to me, even without a strong opinion about the case, to compare a woman in an at LEAST mutually toxic situation to a cartoon character that literally only existed to be the abuser of one of the show's most beloved characters. And the discomfort i felt with that joke put me on track to paying more attention to the actual case.",5,2024-10-14T16:00:00Z,2024-10-14T16:04:10Z

I watched the trial and walked away angry at all the morons hollering about Johnny being the victim because it was obvious to me based solely on that trial that they were both horrible and abusive. When I saw how crooked and manipulated the judge was and the ruling out of ALL Amber's objective, independent evidence including her medical records I fucking lost it.

And I just heard the same stories of the bed and the finger recirculated, and they weren't debunked until literally watching this video.

@sr6550,"I know that that the Amber Heard case is not really the point of the video, it is more the hook, but I do want to comment on it.
I had never heard of Amber before the case, and the only remember Depp from The Pirates of the Carribean, which I barely remember watching, so I don't think I went in it particularly biased for or against either of them based on their reputation. I did watch all the court footage, because there were several lawyers on youtube explaining the court system, the whys and hows of court proceedings ands that made it interesting. I don't remember much anymore, but I do distinctly remember that most of the media shone Amber in a very positive light untill half-three quarters of the proceedings had happened. 

My takeaway from it all was that they were both incredibly toxic for each other and both abused each other, and I don't remember thinking that Heard's abuse towards Depp was primarily reactionary based on abuse from Depp. 
But then again, I don't know much about domestic abuse besides signs to look out for, so I probably did not have the info to spot for things like that.

Amber Heard was a 26 year old (queer) D-list celebrity when they got together. Johnny Depp was a 48 year old superstar with a long and well-documented history of abusive behavior and substance abuse.

Sometimes the power dynamics are complicated. This was not. This was a clear-cut case of a powerful man predating upon a young woman.",93,2024-10-14T15:57:18Z,2024-10-14T15:57:18Z

@nikolademitri731,"I‚Äôve thought for ages this was mutual abuse, because every time I looked into it, I couldn‚Äôt get to super good evidence of anything other than both of these people being abusive, and most definitely both being assh0les. Tbf, I only ever spent 10 minutes at a time tops looking into it, because on a scale of important sh!t going on, I just always felt this was way towards the bottom of what I could justify spending my time on. Overall, I spent 45 minutes to an hour max, and every time I just came back to understanding both of them as miserable people who I could believe started sh!t with each other, and created conditions that lead to abusive behavior. I have a very hard time believing that there‚Äôs evidence out there that would get me to change my mind on that, *but* I would absolutely change my mind on that, if given said evidence. 

That all said, I never bought into the campaign against Amber, or that Johnny was the real victim, etc, and so on, into basically all the popular narratives that existed. Not only didn‚Äôt I see any evidence to buy those narratives, but I‚Äôve been in my own abusive relationship, and have had friends in them (straight and gay), and while this being a celeb thing does make it different publicly, there‚Äôs still some parallels to any other highly toxic relationship that descends into abuse.. People will take sides with the more popular party, and want to believe their friend (or in this case parasocial personality) isn‚Äôt capable of bad behavior. Hell, we want to believe we aren‚Äôt capable of it, and we want to focus on how we were harmed only, but we are capable of it when the context and conditions are ripe for it. For a couple years, *I thought I was the real victim,* and I was, but I also wasn‚Äôt innocent, and facing that was one of the hardest things I ever have had to do. Recognizing you engaged in abusive behavior is actually its own trauma, on top of the trauma that you experienced when being abused‚Ä¶ 

I realize I‚Äôm in danger of projecting my own experience a bit too much here, and I also recognize that, being my toxic relationship was two cis men, the dynamics are importantly different.. Still, I‚Äôm really not a fan of taking away agency, intention, and capacity for abuse, from persons who can be considered to have *less* power (less power =\= no power), and from what I kept seeing with this case was that people really wanted to make the person they are more sympathetic to into a kind of powerless, blameless victim.. In *my* experience, between my relationship and others I‚Äôve known, that‚Äôs usually not an accurate representation of what‚Äôs going on.. And I want to be really careful, because I absolutely know that there are blameless victims of abuse who did NOT contribute toxicity or abusive behaviors into the mix.. I also know that from personal experience, though in my case from childhood, but that still happens on a daily basis in adult relationships, where things are just black and white, period. That‚Äôs all just to keep people from thinking I‚Äôm victim blaming, or that I would: I‚Äôm not, I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs also to make a distinction between that and this, which I just don‚Äôt see reason to believe isn‚Äôt a case of two toxic people who had abusive behaviors. 

Lastly, Johnny was almost definitely worse, from what I have read.. and tbf, I also just get that vibe. The vibe is less important, obviously. This is way too long a comment, frankly with TMI that I might regret posting, but I had time this morning so I figured I‚Äôd give my Enlightened Centrist‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (not really) two cents in. Probably is good you made this and made these points, bc obviously Amber is a victim of not only an abusive hate campaign, but of abuse from Johnny. I just don‚Äôt think her hands are clean. That obviously doesn‚Äôt mean she deserved anything, nobody does. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to have her face in the lineup as much as Johnny does, but neither of them deserve to be seen as mere victims imo.. They both suck, even if Johnny is worse (and he is).",4,2024-10-14T15:48:56Z,2024-10-14T15:48:56Z

@Skotbot,"Anyone who watched the defamation trial between Depp and Heard objectively could see that Heard was not truthful in many aspects. The jury found all three of Depp‚Äôs defamation claims against Heard to be credible, while only one of Heard‚Äôs three claims was deemed credible, and that related to statements made by Depp‚Äôs lawyer, Adam Waldman, regarding Heard and her friends allegedly staging a scene before calling 911 (after police had already been there earlier that day). Based on trial testimony, Heard displayed traits of borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders, often fearing abandonment and losing control when Depp decided to end the relationship. She fabricated stories of having a broken nose, allegedly caused by Depp, on three separate occasions, yet there are no medical records supporting these claims, and photos of Heard taken the day of or the day after each alleged incident show her looking perfectly healthy. It‚Äôs all in the testimony‚Äîgo watch it. Respectfully, if you didn‚Äôt watch the trial, it‚Äôs important to consider that much of the media reporting was inaccurate, misleading, or embellished. I watched the entire trial, and it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that a lot of the coverage was incorrect or incomplete.",1,2024-10-14T15:47:20Z,2024-10-14T15:47:20Z

@pandorabryn,"I really appreciate this take, but the reason that I thought of it as ‚Äúmutual abuse‚Äú was because of the home videos that Heard recorded in which Depp seemed to be trying to de-escalate the situation and Heard was egging him on and trying to escalate.

@JS10K,"My takeaway was that Heard did seem wrong in the context of the relationship conflict at the heart of the case.  There seemed to be something to the extent of ""mutual abuse"" or even more abusive behavior on the part of Depp outside the scope of the case that we just didn't see an understand.  I saw that Depp's drinking and anger seemed bad and even if he didn't physically abused Heard and she may have physically abused him more than the inverse, he did get drunkenly violent towards objects and had anger issues.  

There were recordings that I believe were outside the purview of the court case that painted Heard being the antagonizer during much of the interactions and conflicts during the time of the case, which Depp being the one trying to descalate and calmly talk during a conflict while Heard would insult and try to antagonize Depp to try to pick a fight, because she felt that was the way to show he cared and was a real man.  It was something that seemed to be supported by her parents and maybe even sister's relationship to Depp compared to Heard along with Heard's reputation with her other relationships that she at that time, it seemed to me that they were already in the process of separating and getting therapy and Heard was exhibiting more abusive behavior and Depp would be the one working to defuse situations.  She even threatened Depp and said no one would believe him that he was abused by her if he said anything about it.

That being said, I do suspect that earlier in their relationship, they might have had a mutual bout of drinking and drug use and partying together with a more volatile relationship, which I don't remember if it was during or predating the time of the bottle incident, but that is my speculation from some time period that was outside the scope of the case.  Basically, it seemed to me that the more toxic and destructive elements of their relationship formed earlier, but for the time during them getting therapy and trying to work on their relationship before splitting that much of the case focused on, Depp seemed like the more stable  one while Heard seemed more abusive in light of their relationship falling apart.

The shit in the bed aspect did seem likely the dog that was spun in a way to make her look bad, but while I don't remember all the details, I think FD painting it was just a dog accident that Depp was trying to paint as revenge wasn't a conclusion I came to since I remember thinking it seemed like the leaving of the soiled sheets seemed like it was still possibly Heard sending a message to Depp or being rude and not cleaning it, but I can't remember.

Depp did seem like he had a serious drinking problem and anger issues, but I'm not sure if he was an angry drunk.  Depp's lawyers painted him as a passive drunk and Heard's lawyers tried to paint him as an angry drunk but there was evidence that supported Depp removing himself from conflict when he'd start getting angry or taking a break, while Heard would be the one trying to reengage and pick a fight because she didn't like the way he'd deal with conflict and felt he was a weak or scared or would try to runaway by not fighting and acting mature and calm.

There was lots of misogynistic fervor surrounding the trial, but I think there wasn't much coverage/analysis from progressive spaces because it was a total mess trying to squarely define one victim without digging into the depths of a relationship that we just weren't around it witness for ourselves and because a lot of people had began to side with Depp after much of the original coverage had painted Depp as the sole abuser and new evidence came that added more nuance and even painted Heard in a bad light, beyond the pooping in the bed sensational info, that created a push back.  

That is why I'm kind of surprised that FD is revisiting this story after having not followed it with this take, because regardless of how many seemed to land on ""mutual abuse"" takes or turned on Heard or at least gained more nuance on their situation, I really don't remember much ""actually Heard was just the victim after all and this was just another case of the patriarchy convincing everyone.  It is possible that her lawyers just sucked and didn't make a good case for her and people paying extra close attention was able to determine the real abuse happening, but I think the difference maker was that Depp's case had lots of receipts and Heard's side didn't present a strong case, from what I recall.

Like I said earlier, maybe at a different time in their relationship, the dynamic took a different form, but from what was presented, Heard seemed way more toxic.  I wanted to believe and understand Heard's perspective, but her case didn't convince me, especially when there was recordings from Heard's own mouth that contradicted what she said or that she didn't have a good explanation for.  The ""mutual"" labeling does paint it as equal when it probably isn't, but while I wouldn't paint Heard as the abuser while Depp only exhibits signs of being the victim, they presented a lot of evidence of Heard being abusive during that time that seemed unequal, that I recall, that makes this take confusing to me to come down so firmly on Heard's side.",9,2024-10-14T15:46:26Z,2024-10-14T15:46:26Z

@tauntingeveryone7208,"If I can find it I will link it but I remember watching a really good video that explained exactly why some victims of violence start becoming violent themselves. They talk about how a lot of Amber Heard supposed abuse of Johnny Depp happened after years of Johnny Depp abusing her. Does this make Amber Heard an abuser? Yes and no. By definition yes but just like a person becoming a thief to feed their family the label does not really apply when you add the context to the situation. There are tons of stories of cops asking women why they did not fight back. When you do fight back you can get labelled as an abuser and be told you are as bad as or even worse than your abuser. TLDR, Amber Heard is a victim of violence that fought back.",2,2024-10-14T15:45:37Z,2024-10-14T15:45:37Z
@PhilTheBronxite,"I appreciate this video. I was also trying to figure out what happened with Heard vs Deep case. And something really didn‚Äôt sit right with me throughout the whole trial. 

Lots of information that people didn‚Äôt want to know. The Princess Weekes video you mentioned really did lay it out perfectly. 

Also something that Weekes did mention is how Amber Heard‚Äôs sexuality comes into play. Heard is bisexual and Weekes did mention that bi women are more likely to be abused by their male partners. Because they are proceeded to cheat more.

So there is an extra layer to this. And I just want to mention that music artists FKA Twigs is about to have her trial against Shia LaBeouf this October. IDK if it will be delayed or they will settle. 

But I am worried that this will become another Heard vs Deep situation. People are already getting on Twigs because ‚ÄúShia LaBeouf is sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a changed man‚Äù

@Khiarika1,"I'm so disappointed in this take FD. As someone who heard the tapes with her admitting to punching him, saying ""who's going to believe you"". Who saw the photos of his fingertip cut off, her police report of abusing her former female lover. Clear evidence of her fabricating stuff against him. Her disappearing and re-appearing bruises. She's been exposed by employees a former friend, the cops SHE and her friends called. Lies after lies after lies this man has been subjected to. Hell even Kate Moss exposed her as a liar and her (Heard's) testimony ended up on tik tok because her acting was so bad. 

Is was frustrating enough to hear ""mutual abuse"" because people STILL can't truly wrap their mind around a woman being violent and abusive to a man. But for time to go on and it to be reduced to HER being a victim while still re-victimizing this man...is just crazy, lazy and disappointing. No you didn't do your research. Yes you (clearly) do see all women as innocent. I love your content but clearly no one is perfect.

The clear lies that she said on the stand.  Lying about donating to charities.  The multiple recordings of her admitting to hitting at throwing things at Depp. Not to mention just how bat shit insane she sounded being manipulative and verbally abusive all while laughing manically on those recordings. The lawyers would show the jurors pictures of her bare faced with no marks or blemishes and she would say that the night before, Johnny was beating her face in with large rings on...but you dont see the marks because she iced it. The video of the sister admitting that Amber beat her up and another time when Amber punched her and threw wine in her face (she was on the stand definding Amber afterwards). There were so many other things and all of Amber and her friends didn't seem believable that entire trial. She certainly did have an online hate campaign run against her by incels. I agree with that.

@FishareFriendsNotFood972,"Why oh why is all this mess have I not seen what I see as a far more important issue here: how discrimination especially comes out through 'over punishment'. Let's say, just for the sake of argument, Amber lied, she made it all up (stay with me here everybody!). EVEN IF she did, hopefully we can see how she was over punished. And over punishment tends to force people into false dichotomies; EITHER the person is 'guilty', and therefore deserving of every terrible thing society does to them, OR they are innocent and nothing should be done to them. The bigger problem is guilty women do NOT deserve how they are treated. Men who cheat get slaps on the wrist, women who cheat lose their lives. We have mountains of evidence showing if you are guilty and black, you have harsher punishments than guilty white people. It's easy to say someone doesn't deserve discrimination when they have provably done nothing wrong. But the harder and more important work, in my opinion, is helping those members of discriminated against groups who have indeed done something wrong, but still do not deserve the 'over punishment', inhumane, awful treatment they get as a result. It seems a lot of the commentary on youtube doesn't want to address the over punishment bit head on, so is stuck first trying to establish Amber is innocent, therefore didn't deserve it. I think the better point is, no matter if Amber did or did not do everything Johnny said she did, she did NOT deserve what she got.

TL;DR: Hopefully we can all agree as a society that the penalty for shoplifting should not be cutting off people's right hands. Over punishment is injustice, regardless of whether someone did the thing they are accused of.",9,2024-10-14T15:41:09Z,2024-10-14T16:30:38Z

These are two real people who were in what looks like a disastrous relationship, and my thoughts on what happened should have 0 stakes in the world or their personal relationship whatsoever. Obviously I hope no one was abused. It seems like they both were just kind of terrible for each other. I don't need to know more than I do already.

@thefoxoflaurels3437,"I was a male sex trafficking victim, specifically because the amount of men who want femboys without anyone knowing their homosexual proclivities known is scarily high. They would drug me for ten years and I have to take solace in the fact I may never know what was done to me and when.

The only pieces of media that have effecticely representing what I went through is Baldur's Gate 3 and Blink Twice. My closest friends don't speak to me anymore because I was painted as an incel for warning my conventionally attractive woman best friend that her boyfriend SA'd us. It's probably the worst thing you could do to someone.

And yeah, no one has done anything. None of the authorities have reached back to me, all my friends who espoused progressive values sold me out to my abusers, and no one has even considered warning my friends that maybe they're being lied to. They pulled a knife on me and everything. I'm almost positive I'm on the internet. 

People want a perfect victim. I was an openly bisexual effeminate furry male stripper. Those guys couldn't have done anything. They're not into men, etc. I'm afraid someone else would need to be hurt before someone cares. 

Also, never take drinks from people. Ever. Every night you go out keep a log of events. Way, way more people have been drugged than they realize. It's real-world dark magic and abusers will cover themselves up before you even realized what happened.",1,2024-10-14T15:34:37Z,2024-10-14T15:37:12Z

I'm a survivor who was badly affected by this case and the media storm around it, but the work Medusone and others (such as Princess Weekes with her video ""True Crime and the Theater of Safety"") put into defending Amber and correcting the narratives of the case has honestly helped to heal some of that.

He‚Äôs Jack Sparrow, he‚Äôs the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, he‚Äôs Edward Scissorhands, not a sad guy that can‚Äôt age gracefully and is still convinced he can party like a rock star, that it‚Äôs still cool and subversive instead of quite alarming) man should be able to get away with criminal behaviour.",1,2024-10-14T15:25:26Z,2024-10-14T15:25:26Z

I'm non-binary but in recent years I've been looking inward at my own perpetuation of white feminism, and how my identity can feel like a shield against criticism. In this case it's extremely important to hold both her womanhood and her whiteness as pillars in the narrative, because both pillars change the dynamic of the public's reaction. 

One of the biggest notes I took in was how the  ""Amber went on the bed"" line is directly meant to tarnish Amber's beauty, her main privilege as a white woman celebrity, that could win her empathy with the public. If she's seen as someone who does such gross things, she's no longer as beautiful and empathetic because that grossness takes the forefront.",5,2024-10-14T15:22:40Z,2024-10-14T15:22:40Z

I'm glad that you and others have come to understand the importance of this event, but it was very discouraging and infuriating at the time to see so-called ""leftists"" call this ""drama"" and dismiss it - or worse, defend Depp. And the same dynamics are playing out now with Gaza. A group of abused people fight back against their abusers, and the popular response has been to frame the victims as the abusers and the grotesque things that Israel is doing to its victims are ignored. In this case, leftists have been more supportive of Palestinians than they were for Amber Heard, but I still see people not wanting to get involved in a ""complicated"" situation or saying ""both sides have done bad things."" If the public discourse around the Depp/Heard trial had gone differently and people had learned accurate ways to think about abuse, the reaction to ""real"" political events might be different as well.

@itsallenwow,"After you talked about HBomb and the way his video brought attention to James Somerton.

I think you should have talked about Asmongold, and not talking about him in the context of the Heard trial online response is just a huge missing piece.

I was someone who like you decided to mostly sit out commenting on the trial. I also don‚Äôt like Amber Heard that much, even though I probably have seen like 2 movies she‚Äôs been in.

@zayansayed1060,"This is incredibly difficult to watch. Im commenting as i watch. 

its proving what i know to be true. these leftist spaces are not truly safe or supportive of women. Almost immediately there is a cheeky tone to the video that is carried through and there is no discussion of misogyny and tendencies to discredit and devalue womens narratives. You say that the natural inclination is disgust to ambers pooing on the bed. Which makes no sense. Diddys accusations came out just now. R kelly, Dr luke, how many men with allegations have commit such horrific and disgusting acts people discuss frequently and yet a narrative about amber pooping is the line? i dont buy it. 

There is this constant attention to ambers character and moralizing the situation. I am genuinely shocked you said "" I do not like amber heard"" What relevance does that have. What does that succeed. This is why im so frustrated by the inability to say misogyny to say women hating culture that leftists do not care to reform.

How did we let johnny get away with this?
you said it yourself 
you dont like her.

I cannot speak on the racial dynamics of white women and black men. So i want to acknowledge that i do not want to criticize you dishonestly.

but you say the reason is because we are imperfect allies. And this whole video, its like that thesis is being said and is never present in this at all. You are sympathizing to people who looked at an abuse case and sided with the abuser. The language and charactizing and moralizing is so baffling. 

This video feels so irresponsible because the discourse has now been watered down the point where creators can acknowledge they can do better but never have to follow through. They can state vaguely and with some room for doubt that amber was a victim. and then thouroughly demean and criticize her, and end off stating a thesis to which they do not even adhere to in the damn video. and ofc dont forget to subcribe like doobly doo and buy some nebula too!

i watched and consumed so much content about amber heard because it was important and set the standard to which women will be held to in this online era. The only parts i skip are peoples cruel commentary. Out of every part of the case, dishonest misinformed youtube reactions are the MOST triggering of all of this. 

the reason this happened is because leftists dont care about women, and everything that happens to us is treated as unimportant and a distraction and a nuisance and does not deserve a lick of sincerity. This video is proof. If this is what you are giving i dont want it. take it back and say nothing. i dont expect women to be defended. but it does sadden me that when we are acknowledged its to set the bar as low as possible.",0,2024-10-14T15:12:05Z,2024-10-14T15:12:05Z

@ginamiller2157,"I think its important to watch the whole trial. I have no love for JD and the way he was treated like a child during the trial and I didn't know much about AH. I did believe all her allegations prior to the trial and was astonished at how much of it was not only not substanstiated but was contradicted by evidence presented by her own legal team. 

While it does become clear that these two people are deeply troubled and I do believe JD was made to be painted a saint, Amber lied several times during the trial and took no accountablity for her behaviour on her own recordings and evidence presented to her. She never at one instance acknowledged that her behaviour at times was demeaning, vindictive and harmful - not just to him but to other people.  There were also more than a few legal YTs who were very unbiased in their analysis  (e.g. Emily D. Baker).

Personally, it did not seem that any of this came to light due to a motivation of justice and her and her team's attempt to paint herself as the perfect victim fell flat. This is not entirely her fault - the standards for women in these cases are much much higher and the media initially centred her  in a way that they do all the time when it comes to white - centred feminism (as a white woman who could do no wrong and had no agency), so she had little room to be judged in a way that was nuanced.  I think if she had tried to distance herself from this narrative,  it would have left less fodder for the bad faith actors on social media or at least would have given their stance less credibility.  

Saying that I don't believe JD is a victim, I do believe it was likely he was abusive to an extent and I do believe that looking at the way he talks about women (including his ex-partner of 14 years who he left for a woman 20+ years his junior after infedility), he is not a good guy. She also didn't deserve the pillaging she got on social media. That was disgusting, particualarly the remarks about harming her baby.",15,2024-10-14T15:02:37Z,2024-10-14T15:19:21Z

@BlackVulpes,"Okay so I'm a huge fan for years, agree with almost all your points and analysis ever, and have had my mind changed by or educated by you time and time again. I say this all to thing I say I do genuinely believe Heard is not worth it. 

No one is going to go through the work of sitting through the trial now after everything is settled, but as some one who watched that trial day after day, who believes in the me2 movement, knows how horrible men can be, and is fully aware how wealth and power lets you get away with everything, let me just say this: Heard was guilty. I believe that not despite everything, because of everything, I watched that trial day in day out from 3 different angles.

Amber Heard had every hallmark of textbook abuser narcissism. Her stories and testimony in court never lead up, she only had grifters and people who seemed afraid of her to take the stand in her defense, And her entire mode of operating and brand of trying to gain sympathy offended literally everyone in the court. It went from a case that was impossible to win with everyone against Johny to everyone turning around and agreeing that she was indeed the abuser more than johnny. All based on Heards behavior and the way she ordered the case. Depp didnt get up and charm everyone with a jack sparrow twirl, Heard just tanked her own chances by being a monster. 

The austrilian case as well was so badly set up and clearly biased towards heard that it had to be thrown out and re litigated because it was shown the judge had an entire conflict of interest with Heard and being paid by her manager team. Thats why the 2nd trial in america despite having all the steps set up against it still went through. 

Media at the time was trump washing her at every step, literally miss reporting testimony or making it sound like Heard was still the unambiguous victim. If anything I'd say it shows how media is unequipped to deal Heard who was trying to be a perfect victim and couldn't despite having all the momentum on her side. People were ready and wanting to believe her. Far more than Depp.

 I think the problem is that men do need to do better and clearly do, and Heard seems like she deserves to have some of that credit. But I promise from someone who has lived with that exact person for years, tried every which way to help and understand them, and then had to move past them. Yeah, Heard aint no victim. Atleast if she was, she became the monster by far. The idea that Depp was a perfectly controlling mastermind while high off his ass from ketamine is wild to me.",7,2024-10-14T14:59:27Z,2024-10-14T14:59:27Z

I had seen some detractors but it always seemed like they didn't think he could be abused because he was a man. I never saw any evidence that the allegations were false or wildly exaggerated.

@GoldnDusty,"It is a tiny part of this otherwise good video, but I just wanted to point out that at 15:35 you reference the Salem Witch trials as one in a line of amusing references to society as a whole hating women. I agree with the sentiment, and get the joke, but I just wanted to highlight that Salem (and its ilk) is frequently presented as a short-hand for abuse of women on a wide scale, when it's a much more complex historical event which aligns with the witch panic in post-enlightenment Europe. It certainly had an impact on women's right, but not only were they more of a religious hysteria (one sect demonising another) in which 6 men were killed alongside 14 women, but the overwhelming majority of accusers or witnesses were teenaged girls who admitted to fabricating their claims, years after the fact.

@SirYaliBeats,"I think you‚Äôre very misinformed about this case. It was a publicly broadcasted trial that Johnny Depp advocated for. Using the two points of reference for how Depp should be deemed the abuser doesn‚Äôt overturn anything. I agree that it was the dog and not her, and I think him manically writing blood on the mirror is questionable. I‚Äôm not sure if you followed the case; I did every day while driving around at work. There‚Äôs a reason why the consensus is that she was the true abuser or maybe this was mutual abuse. 

There‚Äôs audio recording evidence about her hitting him and not accepting accountability. 

There‚Äôs evidence of him trying to escape her and her pressing him. He‚Äôs even locked himself in a bathroom.

There‚Äôs eyewitness testimony of her being the aggressor.

She lied about faking abuse and doctoring photos.

She‚Äôs leaked misinformation to TMZ which a former employee, who had nothing to gain from coming forward because he risked being sued, came forward and rejected her claims.

She‚Äôs been caught lying on the stand multiple times. 

Her original op-ed statement that skyrocketed her career and destroyed Depp‚Äôs in the first case in UK, I believe, was dismantled for which she had to pay restitution for. 

Her lawyers were utterly outclassed, not because Depp is a powerful figure, but because her case wasn‚Äôt strong. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with the tertiary information in your video. The attacks at the RP space seem a bit petulant for someone of your caliber, not that I care for them, it just seems unnecessary. Otherwise, this isn‚Äôt a particularly strong video trying to advocate for Amber Heard, especially when there are glaring holes in your argument.

This is obviously not a novel take, but I bring it up because I have a relevant anecdote.

I recently saw a video about Detroit by a white urbanism YouTuber, and in it he defended the gentrification at the hands of billionaires like Dan Gilbert by saying that if you ask the people living in Detroit, you aren't going to hear a whole lot of people wanting to go back to where the city was twenty or thirty years ago. And yes, if you ask the people CURRENTLY living there who obviously can still afford to live there, of course gentrification is good for them, but that erases the displacement (and often homelessness) of the (largely BIPOC) people who can no longer afford to live in their hometown. It was incredibly disappointing to see this person literally point out the gentrification and then completely sidestep the main reason why gentrification is bad.",319,2024-10-14T14:51:22Z,2024-10-14T14:51:22Z

@tyghe_bright,"I was a huge fan of Depp when I was younger. Then he befriended Hunter Thompson. I figured Depp was at best an asshole, and more likely a toxic mess.
I also used to consider body language/micro-expression analysis interesting--but MAN was it weaponized against Heard, in ways that were obvious bullshit. Like, I can read the disdainful smirk on Depp's face and the fear on hers without training. But her awkwardness was not recognized as a shut-down victim trying to confront her abuser. (And yeah, she seems like a terrible person in other ways.) He has the slick charisma of a sociopath. (No idea if he IS a sociopath, not what I'm saying. I'm saying he shares this specific trait with sociopaths.) 
Finally, I watched the video she took of him throwing a tantrum in the kitchen. This was used in the narrative to prove she was trying to set him up somehow... but I've been in a relationship with a violent alcoholic. I recognized that behavior. Even if he never directed that violence to her body, he created an atmosphere of terror with that behavior.

Also, Depp has MUCH more power than Heard. In terms of money, of fame, of charisma, and because he is a man.",1,2024-10-14T14:49:49Z,2024-10-14T14:57:52Z
@johnnyryall3369,"In france we had a documentary that changed completley my take on this story. Depp lawyer used masculinist and incels on the net to spin public opinion and deciding the narrative

here's a excerpt for those who want more info 
""On February 15, 2023, France 5 (a French TV Channel) has broadcast a new episode of its programme ‚ÄúLa fabrique du mensonge‚Äù (the lie factory) dedicated to the case between actor Johnny Depp and actress Amber Heard, who were married between 2015 and 2017, in 2022, a documentary by C√©cile Delarue and Elsa Guiol. In this programme, we discover the power of influence of the masculinist movements.
[..]""
Indeed, we learn that Depp‚Äôs lawyer approached masculinist YouTubers and bloggers before the trial began and provided them with recordings of arguments, exchanges and messages from the couple. These people then edited them to make Johnny Depp appear innocent and to demonise Amber Heard. This method of modifying information, by taking simple pieces of information and reorganising them to their advantage, was used throughout the trial to shift public opinion.""",16,2024-10-14T14:49:21Z,2024-10-14T14:49:21Z

@JamsandTea,"Really cool that you stepped up to the plate on this one. I know engaging in internet drama of any kind online can be a minefield, so I really appreciate the clarification for that little joke. I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve seen a lot of YouTubers I watch regurgitate the talking points of this case and it definitely made me feel a type of way seeing Heard in that picture, but I figured the context of the joke explained itself adequately and I was just a little reactionary. People I loved and trusted got into all this and frankly it‚Äôs nice to have a voice of reason parse through all this just to try and dispel the nonsense.",179,2024-10-14T14:07:42Z,2024-10-14T14:07:42Z
