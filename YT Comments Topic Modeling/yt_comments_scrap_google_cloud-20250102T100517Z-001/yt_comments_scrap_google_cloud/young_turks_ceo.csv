@drlarryjohnson7880,"Guys, I'm so pissed about Gaza that I have little sympathy for our system of healthcare.  Seriously.  You may think there's no connection.  Our heatlhcare system needs radical change.  The Insurance systems is highway robbery and murderous to the American people.  I know you said you don't want to get partisan about it but come on! Trump is going for massive, ridiculous tax cuts for billionaires, while he and the Republicans are going to plan to trash the one reform the American people achieved through Obama, the ACA.  I absolutely do NOT condone coldblooded murder.  But as a society, we didn't care about funding and supplying coldblooded murder Gaza.  This case is ripe for jury nullification, and if that starts a true catalyst to make our society just in terms of healthcare, it will be a step in the right direction for a society that has gone morally off the rails.   It will entirely depend on the skill of his defense attorney.  I bring that up becomes citizens have been offering money to pay for the guy's defense and his attorney his head negatively about it.  This is for sure is one of those cases where the style of attorney will matter.  If he gets a typical court appointed defense attorney, that person is likely to be not skilled enough to mount a nullification defense.  I know what I am saying is really Machiavellian.  but the Billionaires don't give a damn about letting thousands die to line their pockets.  He's going to need big bucks to get a truly skilled attorney.  Jury nullification has a storied history in American court room dramas.  Reform the healthcare Insurance system once and for all!  Why does Congress keep trying to screw the American people in obtaining their inherit right to healthcare?

The guy absolutely met the definition of a parasite. Don‚Äôt tone-police language‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt come off authoritative. It comes off condescending. Instead stick to meaning, intention, and motive in stories like these.

As other for-profit, healthcare insurance providers are pulling down their C-suite members‚Äô biographies from their websites, it‚Äôs the first indication ever that these people feel any fear for the kinds of profits that they are responsible for generating, and the ways in which they do it. For a lot of them, is maybe the first time they‚Äôve ever been afraid in their entire lives. And maybe that‚Äôs actually been the source of the problem all along. A healthy society needs checks and balances. And until the other day, there were absolutely none.

Either way, America is an enormous clusterfuck among developed nations and the way that the vast majority of them care for their citizens. And until the events of the past few days, it‚Äôs not clear that anything else was going to move that pendulum. 

Please don‚Äôt tell me you think that education and journalism could have changed the status quo like this singular act of violence did (against a piece of shit PARASITE who totally had it coming).

@jrkovar,"Call this violence wrong, if ya like. But could it not POSSIBLY end up saving many lives in the future, because...  here we are talking about a business practice that systematically kills 10's of thousands annually, while bulldozing their premiums into mountains of cash.  Some call that genocide and robbery. 

Sometimes we find ourselves rooting for the villain of a story. Often we feel they've been willing to do something extraordinary to ameliorate a large grievance that would not have changed otherwise, and which few others would have dared. Are we not observing a similar story unfolding in the real world? 

How many years are we reasonably expected to ""write your congressional rep"" and ""speak power to truth"", while our friends, family, and community suffer and die from treatable illnesses in our midst --- while a few lucky psychopaths pay a pittance of their fortunes to elect officials who will deregulate insurance companies, thereby legitimizing organized crime?

Yet, all of this had fallen to the back of our collective consciousness, until the action taken by Mr. Mangione swung the spotlight back on the legalized pillaging of a country from within. The term parasite is nasty and borderline dehumanizing, for sure. But, if the nasty borderline human shoe fits...

I reckon Robin Hood would've had to deal with mass media's contention that robbing the King is not the way to feed the poor. ""Talk with the king. Peace! Diplomacy must prevail!"" All the while, the king looks down from his walls and licks his chops as you approach.

If, after many years of political stagnation and weaponization of the topic of health-care, taking action to motivate high-performing money grubbers, via erasing one of them, to imitate humanity in order to get life-saving and quality-of-life saving treatment for 10's of thousands more paying customers  is wrong... do we want to be right?",8,2024-12-10T18:22:31Z,2024-12-10T19:02:16Z

@paulwolinsky1538,"I watched a very worthwhile YouTube video about not posting political opinions, and rather devoting yourself to Christ, but the problem seems not to be with the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Mr. Thompson, who probably DIDN'T care about claims denials, and poor treatment of insurance clients, but a political system and economic environment in which Mr. Thompson (whose salary was apparently around $10 million, not that much by some standards,) is allowed to profit, by whatever amount, in a badly regulated or, even, UN-regulated quote unquote ""free market Capitalist"" ideoogically propelled system, which, in the end looks the other way as people (Their customers, who in America are supposed to be ""Always Right""). suffer horribly or are left untreated.

There are tons of politicians sitting idly by while this is going on. They must know they are setting themselves up for another January 6.

If so many think defunding the police is a great idea, why should people go without police protection? Why don't we just take seriously the idea that police are or should be educated,  well-trained servants of both the law and the public at one and the same time. All of this means that politicians/legislators craft laws that properly direct the behavior and principles that guide police enforcement and contact with communities.

No matter how smart the killer was, he could have done a lot more and a lot better with his education. Of course, the reason he must have opted to murder is because no one else is fixing a badly flawed and badly broken system.",0,2024-12-10T15:57:11Z,2024-12-10T15:57:11Z

@commonwunder,"A huge problem with the West : If your educated don't speak out, or do something about unfettered greed getting out of control.
Then the uneducated masses definitely won't. The masses will moan a bit, but do nothing. It is only the educated that can change society.
And as the educated are mostly in great paying jobs, their allegiance is to the greed. So this built-in system of ever growing inequality, continues.",3,2024-12-10T14:11:47Z,2024-12-10T14:11:47Z

NOW, they're NOT going to deny my claims, so the last five years of apprenticeship solely for the sake of surgery, have NOT been for nothing. So don't tell me it's not the answer, when it's the only thing that has EVER worked so far.

Saying it's not the answer, only works under circumstances where something else might work. It's called desperation. We continue to try and vote in a progressive, but the DNC denies their base and installs corporatists to go and lose the general election to an opportunist fear monger every time. Corporate rule has ONE solution until someone comes up with another way.

Go tell Robin Hood it's not the answer. This man got my insurance company to do the right thing; a singular accomplishment. From where I'm standing it looks like the ONLY solution so far. Washington put up those walls, and Washington can carve out a better alternative. And they will. When they realize the alternative is literal heads literally rolling.

We all know how self centered people are. The more inclined a person is to acquire wealth/power on the backs of others, the more sociopathic that person is by proxy. YOU think of something else that will pry their old selfish hands off the profit motive. Until then, this is the only thing that has ever done ANYTHING for us, and people definitely noticed.

@ilmostro16,"United Healthcare is publicly traded, which means the CEO, whoever it is, has a fiduciary duty to the stock price being as high as possible. This unfortunately is counter to the quality of the service, unlike many other companies that produce products. For example, if publicly traded Apple sells crap phones, the stock price will go down. There, the interests of the customers and the shareholders are aligned. Bad products, bad stock price. Good products (high sales), good stock price.  But with insurance, the happier the customers are, the more the insurance company has to pay out, which means lower profits, and lower stock price. With insurance, the happier the customers are, the lower the stock price - the interests of the customers and the stakeholders are not aligned. This is the problem with the insurance system.  

Side note, one of the reasons Americans have a lower life expectancy is diet and fitness, too much obesity in this country and that‚Äôs the main reason, not insurance companies. Until we face that head on and hardcore, we will be unhealthy and have unaffordable healthcare because an unhealthy population requires too much healthcare. The issue is our poor health more than anything. Stop overeating, stop eating processed fake food, and go for a f-ing walk at least.",4,2024-12-10T11:41:39Z,2024-12-10T11:41:39Z

@WilliamOpferman,"I have health care insurance under part A and B Medicare along with WellCare and they take about $170 a month out of my Social Security check for the extra Medicare benefits. I truly regret signing up for this, even though the WellCare premium is ‚Äúzero ‚Äú. I feel that the doctors and medical treatment providers are so out of touch with good health practices and healing and poorly educated concerning causes of illness and poor health conditions that going to see them is a waste of time and paying for treatment has become a waste of money. All they want to do is prescribe pharmaceuticals that cause more problems and then prescribe more pharmaceuticals for the problems caused by the pharmaceuticals. I know of people who were on up to 18 different medications and only showed improvement after medications were reduced or eliminated only to still have the problem they originally went in to see the doctor for. This is the sad state of our healthcare system and should not be accepted not funded by the patients or the government. Insurance companies should also never have been subsidized by Medicare. I have opted to refuse any and all medical treatments except in the case of accidental injury. I am getting old and have watched my parents suffer and die under the current medical system. I would rather die quietly, quickly and peacefully under more natural circumstances. But the corrupt system is there for those who choose to use it and use of it is what supports it. I also understand that dying is usually not without pain and the current system will drag out the process of dying for years as long as they can get money for it, but they just let the poor and indigent die with minimal care. It‚Äôs not a left or right thing, both sides are for the elite donors and guess what?  They aren‚Äôt for either side, they are for their own selfish interests and donate to both sides so that they get whatever they want no matter who is in power. It would be comical if it wasn‚Äôt for how badly the regular are treated and exploited. In the end it really doesn‚Äôt matter who a poor person like me voted for. My wages determine my lifestyle and I have to choose what I will do and hope and try to find a decent employer. It‚Äôs about each person taking responsibility for their own life and should not be the government‚Äôs responsibility.",1,2024-12-10T11:16:15Z,2024-12-10T11:16:15Z

i think most people just reacted w the collective 'meh',  a murderer killing another murderer. The guy's for profits actions over real lives ended up coming back to him. There's a thought in this country if you hide behind a company, laws, or a system ie 'ai-determined denials' you'll get away with it; but people will still defend themselves esp if they have nothing more to lose or have lost family/loved ones to a broken system. So in that context, this was really not surprising to most. :/",2,2024-12-10T07:07:19Z,2024-12-10T07:34:17Z

@wrongturnVfor,"why are all these assassins left wingers? And you are protecting them?  Always condoning the violence. From celebrating attempt on Trump, minimizing the incident, spreading lies about ""shrapnel"" and now this. You are insane. Just like Liz Cheney. That is why I no longer associate myself with the left. Havent for a decade. You all are frothing at the mouth hatemongers and continuously egg on violence, coups and wars. And support the establishment. 
I like how they are trying make it partisan by saying he agreed with Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson which there is no evidence of. On the other hand, he is a student of an Icy league school, p[posted a Unibomber manifesto, carved a left wing book title on the bullet and allegedly did it because of healthcare being bad. Even though  he himself is loaded and ofcourse wouldn't be personally hurt by it That is as left winger a profile as I ever saw one. But sure, continue making it partisan and pretending your opposition if violent as you encourage violence, spread heatred and dehumanize your opposition. Utter garbage, these people. Total establishment doormat filth.

And who even believes this lone gunman BS? We all know Jill is in deep with insurance scammers. And that CEO was about to testify before congress. So he got exactly what the Boeing whistleblower got..I mean who has these many fake ID's just lying around their home for months?   And they trotted out their bootlicking lapdogs at TYT to spew hatred against Insurance CEO's to distract from all that. I have a feeling this suspect is going to be epsteined. Just like oswald. This was a professional job staged as a non professional job. What is the most interesting thing is that Unabomber was an alphabet agency asset and a product of Mk Ultra.  

The resources and the stupidity don't add up. I will repeat, no one is going to be smiling hours before the incident if they are angered by being hurt by healthcare denial. They would be enraged. They wont be carving a message on the bullet, unless they were self exiting too. They wouldn't shoot from behind.They would want to see  the victim's face and they would want the victim to know theirs. None of it even matches the psychological profile of someone hurt by the insurance company. Whch again, he was loaded. So again, it makes no sense. At all. Other than he was a deep state hire.

@ansel_ale,"The term ""parasite"" refers to ""an organism that lives off of, is dependent on, or exploits another organism while giving little or nothing in return‚Äîsometimes even to the detriment or death of the host."" This description seems fitting for someone like the CEO of UHC, who profited immensely from a system that led to the suffering and preventable deaths of countless people. Being a human doesn‚Äôt exempt someone from acting parasitically when their actions exploit and harm others for personal gain.

It‚Äôs also important to consider that violence isn‚Äôt always overt or physical. The suffering and deaths caused by the healthcare industrial complex (denying people access to care, pricing life-saving treatments out of reach) should also be recognized as violence. While we universally condemn physical violence, why do we often turn a blind eye to the systematic violence that corporations and institutions perpetuate for profit? This selective outrage feels contradictory.

When we say ""violence is never the answer,"" it‚Äôs vital to apply that principle universally, including to states and corporations. For decades, these entities have engaged in what could be described as economic and environmental warfare against the working class and the planet itself, often resisting any measures that prioritize human welfare over profit. When people feel trapped and unheard, some might resort to desperate measures, not as an endorsement of violence, but as a tragic consequence of a system that offers no viable alternatives.

The real challenge lies in breaking this cycle. History has shown that meaningful change often comes at great cost through violent means, but if we genuinely want to avoid violence in any form, we must work together to create new, equitable systems that prioritize people and the planet over profit. Ignoring these injustices or relying solely on peaceful protests has never been and will never be enough. The system‚Äôs inherent violence against the most vulnerable needs to be addressed, or the status quo will continue to push people toward desperate actions in what they see as self-defense.

P.S: I want to make it clear that my intention here is to share my perspective, not to engage in an endless comment thread that often leads nowhere and risks devolving into unproductive exchanges. For that reason, I will not be responding to comments or engaging further on this topic. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my thoughts.",25,2024-12-10T05:03:00Z,2024-12-10T05:03:00Z

@restoredaccess,"I just realized most people on the left don‚Äôt know that majority of Trump-supporters are pro-working class, and believe that corrupt corporate giants are destroying the middle class average American life. The Gen X base of Trump voters (I purposefully don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúRepublican voters‚Äù) believe the powers that be are trying to enslave the citizens. 
Pre-Obama, it was the Republican Party who took the lead in turning the US into a corporate vassal state. They used the media and the banks to sell the Iraq invasion and subsequent Patriot Act, as well as decades-long legacy of military compliance and exploitation of foreign governments and economies. Although the transition from the Republican to Democrat party playing this role may have been hard to notice immediately, it should be by now undeniable that the baton has been passed. 
From what I see, it‚Äôs been mostly those on the right wing that have noticed how fake and rigged the whole system is, but there‚Äôs a growing populist progressive element on the left that can see what‚Äôs going on. We‚Äôre going to see those elements from both right and left wing come together and, while still holding different beliefs on methods and ideologies, work together on cleaning up and reforming the machinery that runs the system, starting with proper and honest representation. And the hyper-partisan, easily brainwashed morons on both sides of the political spectrum will be relegated to irrelevance and left out of the process, not by ‚Äúcancellation‚Äù or any act of regulation, but by their own actions and inability to think like educated, mature adults. The next four years are going to be a great time for some from both the left and right wings. And a very bad time for others on both sides.",0,2024-12-10T04:27:44Z,2024-12-10T04:27:44Z

2. Whether we should let the lobbying system going on like it is going now - essentially robbing majority of citizens majority of the times
3. Easy availability of guns and bullets
4. How many times have we had conversion about how bloody idiotic and mindless our healthcare system is and our insurance industry is - so why did nobody take any steps to act? I myself have been witnessing these conversations for the last 27 friggin years.  We go back to lobbying I suppose ... which means nobody will ever act because all politicians are in the pocket of the industry heads. So what is the point of these ENDLESS conversations?
However I agree that violence is never a solution.",3,2024-12-10T03:25:42Z,2024-12-10T03:40:23Z
@sward0483,"So a couple things... even if you are RIGHT, using violence or threats of violence to achieve political goals etc is the textbook definition of terrorism. Second, i wish people would actually look into these countries with universal healthcare. Canada healthcare is total shit. Takes forever to get an appointment if you can even find a doctor with openings. It got even worse with their assisted suicide nonsense as the govnt just denies coverage if they think youve lived long enough and will deny your care. In fact, the government would be far WORSE about approving coverage. The UK healthcare is collapsing on itself. Same thing as canada. Insanely hard to get an appointment and the funding is dried up. Theyre attempting to steal money from farmers to fund it and theres a massive fifht going on over it. Universal healthcare is not the answer. Its actually simple. Do what trump suggested. Make prices public like cost of treatments etc. As it is now hospitals can charge insane amounts because insurance is covering it. Even if theyre denying 1/3 theyre still approving 2/3's. All the government needs to do is make cost of treatments etc public and simply make a policy that restricts how much these treatments cost or how much hospitals etc can charge. You do that and its a win win. Ins companies will approve far more claims and it will lower premiums. Also a side note, i keep hearing 1/3 of claims get denied and while theres no doubt some are bs that shouldve been approved, but id love to know what percent of that 33% are elective surgeries and things that arent life threatening etc. Lets not forget we have had obamacare for quite a long time and all it did was jack up peoples premiums and costs. So its not like we have NO universal healthcare. We do have it and a lot of people were forced onto it even after being told they could keep their doctors and premiums would go down. Both of which were lies. All you need to do is look at how awful the VA is run to see what healthcare would look like if the government was in charge of all of it. Nooooo thank you!",0,2024-12-10T03:25:00Z,2024-12-10T03:25:00Z

@Benjamin-c6g6o,"Despite Biden's shortcomings in handling the Israel situation, Trump, the GOP, and Russia are worse. The Palestine conflict has resulted in 45k casualties, whereas approximately 300k Ukrainian and 700k Russian casualties. Take it from the horses mouth. Russian propaganda openly acknowledges its ambitions to invade more countries and its LITERALLY their mission to destroy democracies. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice uncovered a covert campaign where Russia used the state-controlled media outlet RT to funnel $10 million through a U.S. media company. This company, in turn, paid prominent right-wing influencers to spread Kremlin-aligned propaganda. The campaign is part of Russia‚Äôs ongoing efforts to influence U.S. policy and public opinion, which unfortunately succeeded in getting Trump elected‚Äã. Politicians of the right will get vaccinated but when on air will openly lie and peddle conspiracy theories. Twice as many republicans died than democrats after the vaccines came out because of the right wing medias culture wars to distract for the corporate elite.

Trump never liked the metaphor drain the swamp. He said in 2016 quote ‚ÄúI hated it. Somebody said ‚Äòdrain the swamp,‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòOh, that is so hokey, that is so terrible.'"" Trump has always AB tested in front of crowds and whatever the crowd likes he gives it to them because he doesn't have any ideology. He's a con man and you're a mark. He thinks 'what do you like what do you want' that he'll pretend to be in favor of. When Trump realized his audience loved the phrase 'drain the swamp' he quickly made it part of a standard stum speech in 2016 and again in 2020. It is mainly in 2016 and why he won in 2016. On the campaign trail in 2020 he remarked about the phrase 'drain the swamp' quote: ""I put it in one speech the place went crazy, I said I'm starting to like that expression"". He never believed in it, he's just doing it to get people to believe in him while he does the exact opposite. Trump made an excellent PR move in turning down $400,000 in presidential salary, while behind the scenes in office took $7.8 million from *20* foreign governments.

Brian Ballard is the biggest bundler for Donald Trump. He's given him $50 million in campaign contributions. He used to be the communications director for Citizens United, the actual group that sued to be allowed to do corruption and happen in the first place. They wanted to funnel untold number amount of money to politicians for the donors so they can control the government, and they won that case. He was their communications director and is in many ways patient zero.

In 2020, Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, along with three others, was charged with fraud related to the ""We Build the Wall"" fundraising campaign. The campaign was supposed to raise money privately to help construct a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon and his co-conspirators were accused of misappropriating the funds for personal use. The charges stated that the organizers promised donors that 100% of the money would go toward building the wall, but in reality, hundreds of thousands of dollars were diverted for personal expenses.

Bannon was arrested in August 2020 and pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, just before leaving office in January 2021, President Donald Trump granted him a pardon. The pardon absolved Bannon of federal charges related to the case. Other individuals involved in the scheme were not pardoned and continued to face legal consequences.
Notably, one of Bannon‚Äôs co-conspirators, Brian Kolfage, pleaded guilty to charges related to the fraud in 2022, admitting to misusing the donated funds for personal benefits.",5,2024-12-10T03:24:31Z,2024-12-10T03:24:31Z
@Benjamin-c6g6o,"Vance called Trump Hitler, openly lies about democrats supporting abortion up to the moment of birth, calls a pregnancy from rape an inconvenience, and lied about Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear saying he said he wished for a member of his family to get raped knowing he was referring to him having to deal with an unwanted pregnancy. Regarding his military service and the stolen valor accusations of Walz, it's nonsense. Vance wasn‚Äôt asked to ""serve"" in that ill-conceived war, he didn‚Äôt have a choice. JD served in public affairs rather than on the front lines. As a junior enlisted Marine at the start of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), his options were to deploy as ordered or face a Court Martial for desertion, dereliction of duty, and other charges, potentially landing him in Leavenworth at the USDB. 

Vance's Claim That He LOADED His Guns After Trump Shooting DOESN'T MAKE SENSE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4sMyEwUIG4

Walz was close to retirement when 9/11 happened but delayed it for another four years. As a Command Sergeant Major, he wasn't going to be out on patrol; he was focused on performing the high-level duties expected of someone at the E9 rank. If there had been a significant need, he could have been placed under ‚Äústop loss‚Äù and prevented from retiring. At his age he was eligible to retire which is the typical retirement age that is a common decision for many, but more notably, he retired to run for Congress on a platform focused on ending the war. He campaigned by highlighting the devastation caused by the war and later voted to bring all troops home within 90 days. He could have retired earlier but he stayed in longer. He submitted his paperwork for his Congressional run in early 2005. A few months later he submitted his paperwork for retirement, a few months after that is when the deployment orders to go to Iraq for his Battalion came out so he didn't know in early 2005. Later that year there would be deployment orders.

Trump is a literal draft Dodger. He avoided service in the Vietnam War through student and medical deferments. He said he got a medical deferment for a bone spur in a foot but couldn't remember which foot. When he talked about it in 2015 he reportedly called soldiers who died in war suckers and losers and he also called his sex life in the 80s his own personal Vietnam.

Contrary to the right wing media lies and propaganda there is no policy requiring tampons in boys' bathrooms; instead, the law provides menstrual products in gender-neutral and girls' bathrooms. Democrats are never advocating for switching genders to those who do not want to. Consider this; Would you prefer being with a person who you dont know what is like on the inside because they are keeping it a secret? They will feel comfortable with who they are and you get to know what they are really like.

@Benjamin-c6g6o,"Trump supporters have attacked figures like Nancy Pelosi's husband, an incident Trump later mocked, and even attempted to kidnap a Democratic governor after Trump publicly criticized her. Nevertheless, the claim is that Biden and Harris have been the true instigators of violence. Trump has encouraged and laughed at violent actions from his side numerous times. When he warns people about danger, he‚Äôs only concerned when it affects him. He jokes about Pelosi's husband being attacked with a hammer but takes offense if anything happens to him, showing clear hypocrisy in his reactions to political violence. Trump tweeted that Pence ""didn't have the courage to do what should have been done"" to stop the certification of the election. Which in 60 court cases later with judges even appointed by Trump, failed to provide any evidence. In December 2022, Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. Constitution could be disregarded, stating that a ""massive fraud"" allows for the ""termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" Making Trump and the GOP the biggest threat to American democracy in US history. After Donald Trump learned that his supporters were chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" during the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Trump showed indifference or even approval. According to Hutchinson, Trump reportedly said, ""He doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing anything wrong"" and expressed that Pence ""deserved it."" When told that his supporters were armed, Trump allegedly said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not here to hurt me,‚Äù further fueling concern about his stance on the mob‚Äôs actions. Most acts of terror in the US are caused by right wingers. Something the right wing media makes sure to not inform its viewers to distract them for the corporate elite.

@Benjamin-c6g6o,"RFK Jr. said Trump was ""a terrible human being. The worse [sic] president ever and barely human. He is probably a sociopath."" He criticized President Trump for failing to deliver on his promises to American workers. He accused Trump of promising to revive manufacturing, raise wages, fix trade deals, close tax loopholes, and support small farmers, but instead, catering to the interests of the Republican establishment. According to RFK Jr., Trump's achievements primarily benefited wealthy individuals like Jeff Bezos, deregulated industries for special interests, and provided advantages to large agricultural conglomerates.

RFK Jr. pointed out that Trump allowed influential figures from the Bush-era GOP to dominate his administration, appointing lobbyists from the oil, gas, coal, and pharmaceutical industries to key positions. He also criticized Trump for supposedly supporting small farmers but ultimately funneling funds to large agricultural corporations.

He highlighted the social unrest during Trump's presidency, noting the significant rioting and looting, and accused Trump of inflaming racial tensions and failing to maintain public safety. Instead of addressing the chaos, RFK Jr. argued that Trump allowed Democrat-run cities to burn for political optics.

On foreign policy, RFK Jr. condemned Trump for unilaterally withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty with Russia, which destabilized relations and exacerbated tensions between Ukraine and Russia, leading to war. He also criticized Trump's appointments of neoconservatives like John Bolton, HR McMaster, and Robert O‚ÄôBrien, suggesting that Lindsey Graham might become his Secretary of State in a second term.

RFK Jr. further accused Trump of bombing Syria, killing an Iranian general, and failing to end the war in Afghanistan. He blamed Trump for initiating lockdowns during the pandemic, which he said led to the closure of millions of small businesses and a significant transfer of wealth to billionaires.

Lastly, RFK Jr. claimed that Trump did little to address the opioid crisis, which worsened during his presidency, while his appointees were aligned with the interests of big pharma. He concluded by warning that a second Trump term would likely bring more of the same. In his words ""If you think a second Trump term would be any different, you are engaging in wishful thinking.""

These statements came out merely two months before he threw his support behind Trump. After the Democrats denied him airtime for his unfounded vax conspiracy theories and pro Kremlin aligned propaganda points, he sacrificed any remaining integrity and appears to have opted for a path of bitter revenge.

There is a man in New York that tried to hide his past before an election ... do you approve? Convicted on 34 counts
There's a man that rapes a woman and molests others... do you approve? Adjudicated $92 mil
What if a man keeps secret sensitive files in unsecured ways.... do you approve? And his judge delays indefinitely
What if a man conspires to steal votes... do you approve? 4/19 plead guilty
What if a man cooks the books and steals from the people... do you approve? Adjudicated $463 mil
These are just 6 undisputed questions. Is this the type of person you will support at the sake of losing your own respect?

Drumpf: three times this year he has been adjudicated as a sex offender, company fraudster, and now faces 34 class E felony charges with up to 4 years in jail for falsifying records to cover up his infidelities prior to the 2016 elections that may have changed the result of who would be president of the United States of America! So much for election integrity.

2016 election campaign: five of Drumpf's staff were found guilty of crimes that were used to help Drumpf become president, only to have Drumpf pardon them.
2020 election campaign: five of Drumpf's staff have pleaded guilty to their part in trying illegally to change the outcome of the election, and nearly 55 more people have been indicted in five states for their part in trying to overturn the election with the fake electors.
In business: his personal lawyer was found guilty of crimes related to the 2016 election. The CFO of Trump Co. was found guilty of financial crimes in the company's name and has been to prison twice due to these.

The GOP contender for president has announced that in the event that a delinquent NATO country gets invaded by Russia, he ""would encourage them to do whatever they like."" Article 5 has only been used once, and that was after the September 11 attack on the USA. Is this the true ""Manchurian candidate"" via the Kremlin?

FAKE NEWS has found its father, Mr. Pecker of the ""National Enquirer,"" and Donald Drumpf is its GODFATHER.

I wonder what Daddy and Granddaddy would say about their prodigy turning their name into a term that will go down in history as rich people begging; let's call it ""TRUMPING FOR MONEY.""

I think Little Donald, going by his latest rallies, must be using ""Baby Shark, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo"" to hype himself up with before the rallies, what do you think?

Not that this has anything to do with the election (he is not a politician) or the computer from hell, but for the record, Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony counts regarding his 2nd amendment by misreporting on a firearm license.

05/23/24: US Inflation Rate is at 3.36%, compared to 3.48% last month and 4.93% last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2024, January 2020 2.5%. The U.S. job market expanded in April for the 40th consecutive month, but at a slower pace. 175,000 new jobs were added in April, unemployment rate 3.7%, May 272,000 nearly 100,000 over expectation, January 2020 2.5%. The Dow posted its all-time high during trading on May 16, 2024, reaching a peak of 40,051.05 points making 401k higher, under Trump on January 2020 28,600. The reason you feel poor is that Drumpf and Lara at the GOP keep asking for your last dollar.

@sondranewall4462,"I do not condone murder, but I also do not condone a health care system that pays executives millions of dollars to deny much needed medical care.  Our government has to do something to contain a medical system that awards executives with unbelievable salaries and people wind up dead, sick, blind, deaf, in chronic unbearable pain.  These companies are getting lots of tax payer money to reward executives for denying claims.  There was a movie with Denzel Washington where his son was going to die because the insurance company was denying much needed care to keep him alive.  That movies was so sad, many tears shed while watching it, but so true of a healthcare system that denies much needed care.",3,2024-12-10T03:09:45Z,2024-12-10T03:09:45Z

@dannywindham3295,That is correct if you want to change things you have to change the understanding of the underlying system. What is that system it is the economic system in this country. It is the underlying understanding of how taxation and why Federal taxation takes place. 99% of Americans think their federal tax dollars are funding the federal government that that is not possible. The United States federal government is the Creator and the issue of the currency the US dollar the money article 1 section 8 of The Constitution Congress has the power of the first article 1 section 8 clause 5 of The Constitution Congress shall have the power to coin money and regulate the value of. No one's federal tax dollars not mine not yours not one Federal hillbilly dumb s*** dumb f*** tax dollars is paying for anything federal taxes are deleted that is the entire point of having Federal taxation to remove demand from the economy to remove dollars from the economy to control inflation. How will Medicare for all be paid for it will be paid for by the United States federal government that creates the f****** money to begin with you bunch of stupid ass hillbillies.

@harrywan2604,No one is happy with the price of healthcare but I am not sure that socialized healthcare or whatever would be better IMO more people would go without care if the government handled healthcare look at the UK and where they are at with coverage. However this behavior is hated by the right and I think many of the US have seen two assassination attempts plush this now done due to politics- i do not see this any difference than school shootings as they are senseless killings. This specific example is a system issue that INSURANCE agencies are ALLOWED to do this to people which should be illegal and healthcare should be affordable! However--- socialized healthcare usually lowers ability and wait time meaning people needs more widely no being met. ALSO Americans are extremely unhealthy and to think your going to offer what socialized healthcare offers we would have to get rid of American foods first.,0,2024-12-10T02:26:51Z,2024-12-10T02:26:51Z

@ZachariahWiedeman,"One problem with the motive you're ascribing to him: His family owns and operates a private health care company: Lorien Health Services (See: ""Lorien Health Services Names John Mangione Jr. Vice President, Care Forward"" I95 Business, November 14, 2022). It is one of the few family owned end of life care facility operators in Maryland because UnitedHealth Group has been buying up all the competition in the state (See: ""Justice Department Sues to Block UnitedHealth Group‚Äôs Acquisition of Home Health and Hospice Provider Amedisys"" Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Justice Department, Nov 12, 2024). The more obvious motivation would seem to be that he had a score to settle with UnitedHealth because of how their acquisitions were affecting his family business, and thus his personal fortune.

He also wrote admirably of Ted Kaczynski in a book review of Industrial Society and Its Failures (Goodreads, Jan 23, 2024), writing (quoting someone else, but calling the take ""interesting""), ""When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive. You may not like his methods, but to see things from his perspective, it's not terrorism, it's war and revolution... Peaceful protest is outright ignored, economic protest isn't possible in the current system, so how long until we recognize that violence against those who lead us to such destruction is justified as self-defense. These companies don't care about you, or your kids, or your grandkids. They have zero qualms about burning down the planet for a buck, so why should we have any qualms about burning them down to survive? We're animals just like everything else on this planet, except we've forgotten the law of the jungle and bend over for our overlords when any other animal would recognize the threat and fight to the death for their survival.

@GuillermoMata,"His actions are comparable to those of snipers in the military‚Äîprecise and calculated. However, this goes much deeper. The CEO controlled hundreds of millions of health insurance accounts, wielding immense power and the ability to influence countless lives. We cannot ignore his attempts at insider trading and potential negligence in his role. This situation demands a thorough investigation, as its impact on the health insurance industry could be far-reaching.
Tragically, cancer patients, children, parents, and families have suffered or even lost their lives due to the crippling costs of care. If we, as U.S. citizens, don‚Äôt take a stand, meaningful change will never happen. Sadly, it took a crisis like this to bring these issues to light.",22,2024-12-10T01:56:11Z,2024-12-10T01:56:11Z
