Israel's economy has suffered losses probably approaching $100bn in the past year by now, hundreds of thousands of people have left the country, and the IDF was getting wrecked in Lebanon in a war it's not built to win. Iran's conventional deterrence was absolutely not stripped away according to a single reputable analyst that I've heard from - their air defense turned away the Israeli attack in October before it could enter their airspace and there's no credible evidence they were able to inflict damage. And the Syria situation is very bleak, with reports of people getting executed by militants in the streets. Frankly, you guys could have gotten a dramatically more informative and objective rundown from someone like Ray McGovern or one of the Grayzone people (don't @ me, I have my issues with them too) rather than this rundown that sounds like came from the State Department.",4,2024-12-10T19:58:27Z,2024-12-10T19:58:27Z

@thetrafficlackey,"MAXIMUM RATINGS AND REVENUE RESULTS

Trump supporters are not being lied to. They themselves willingly and enthusiastically participate in spreading Trump's lies. Trump supporters are white-supremacist co-conspirators, and they are being enabled and normalized by a greedy and right-wing corporate-media cabal of billionaires and big business.

The current vitriol directed at migration and refugees, boosted and amplified by so-called news outlets and social media platforms, is a clear example of very specific language being deployed by racist, xenophobic white nationalists. This hateful and explicit propaganda intends to dehumanize immigrants, by calling them ""illegal"" and other bigoted epithets, so as to encourage violence against them.

Moreover, the word ""ILLEGAL"" is just a RACIST EPITHET Republicans and other right-wing white supremacists use in place of more clearly understood slurs for non-white people, including American citizens, who are Latino and/or members of any other community of color.

The terms ""law-abiding citizen"" and ""American,"" according to the bigoted white supremacist lexicon, are reserved for White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. If your surname is Spanish or you have dark skin, you do not fit into their definition and understanding. Those who do not identify as ""Christian"" or who are members of the LGBTQ+ community are left out as well.

Furthermore, you do not have to be white to be complicit in white supremacy. RACISM AND BIGOTRY DO NOT REQUIRE CONSCIOUS INTENT. ALL THEY NEED IS FOR PEOPLE (THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE OF COLOR) TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCOURSE, RHETORIC, AND BEHAVIOR THAT UPHOLD RACIST AND BIGOTED NARRATIVES, SYSTEMS, AND STRUCTURES.

In addition, Trump and his flying-monkey Nazis do not care about executing their ethnic cleansing pogrom effectively and humanely. The fact is, this white-supremacist administration will cause great suffering and tragedy, because of incompetence and corruption. And the uglier and more horrific the result, the more Trump voters will cheer. They want the atrocities. They voted for depravity and torture. They are racist monsters. Trump voters can't wait to j*rk-off to the misery they voted to cause for non-white people, Latinos in particular, and everyone else they hate.

And it will be boosted and amplified by the usual suspects for maximum ratings and revenue results.

EXCERPT:

Azadeh Shahshahani has spent years imploring people in power to do something about two notorious detention centers in rural Georgia. She and her colleagues at the advocacy group Project South had heard countless horror stories from detained immigrants about abuses they had faced at the privately run Stewart Detention Center and Irwin County Detention Center. In 2017, they published reports from Stewart detainees whose severe illnesses and injuries were treated only with ibuprofen, even when they had broken bones. Women at Irwin told them people were regularly fainting from hunger and that diseases were spreading like wildfire while staff ignored them. When people began dying at alarming rates at Stewart, Project South wrote letters to Georgia’s congressional delegation requesting an investigation. They’ve written a lot of letters over the years, without getting much of a response.

This week, Shahshahani was caught completely off guard when something finally broke through. That would be the whistleblower complaint she and her team compiled and submitted on behalf of Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at Irwin, which stopped the news cycle in its tracks this week. The complaint primarily discussed the squalid conditions and violations of COVID-19 protocols at Irwin, but buried toward the bottom, Wooten and several anonymous detainees alleged that many women at the facility had been subjected to unnecessary hysterectomies without consent by a gynecologist known as “the uterus collector.” The hysterectomy allegation was first highlighted by LawandCrime*com, under the headline “ ‘Like an Experimental Concentration Camp’: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges Mass Hysterectomies at ICE Detention Center.” The disturbing reports that a doctor was sterilizing women without their informed consent quickly blew up. Soon it had generated accusations that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was running a genocidal eugenics program. In the following days, other news outlets have raced to corroborate the claims of mass hysterectomies.

President-elect Donald Trump promised on Sunday to deport U.S. citizens as part of his quest to expel all undocumented immigrants, describing them as collateral in his sweeping immigration plans.

Trump told Meet the Press‘ Kristen Welker that he wanted to avoid the family separation scandal that plagued his first administration. But to do so, he said, will require mixed-immigration families—those with undocumented immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens—to leave together.

“I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,” he said.

“You can always find something out like, you know, ‘This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work,‘” Trump said. “I’ll tell you what’s going to be horrible, when we take a wonderful young woman who’s with a criminal. And they show the woman, and she could stay by the law, but they show the woman being taken out. Or they want her out and your cameras are focused on her as she’s crying as she’s being taken out of our country. And then the public turns against us. But we have to do our job. And you have to have a series of standards and a series of laws. And in the end, look, our country is a mess.”

EDITOR'S NOTE: TRUMP'S PLAN TO CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 15% WOULD GIVE:

— The top 5 Wall Street banks a $4.1B tax cut.
— The top 5 drug makers a $3.1B tax cut.
— The top 5 U.S. oil companies a $2.5B tax cut.

In total, it's a $50B giveaway to the largest 100 U.S. companies.

These companies have been raking in record profits. The last thing they need is another big tax cut.
