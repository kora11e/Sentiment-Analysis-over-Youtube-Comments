@tr_2sc1970,"In Kissinger/Nixon's 1970 Black September and their Jordanian partner's war against the Palestinian military existence in Jordan to avail secure borders to Israel, the Syrian president Nuriddin Al Atassi sent help to the Palestinians while the Syrian Air Force commander Hafez Al Assad refused to help and couped Al Atassi! He, Al Assad became a president to Syria. Al Assad in 1975 helped ignite war against the Palestinians (secular and leftists then) and the Lebanese Sunnis and  Druze while  helping the  Christian Maronite Phalangists. He massacred them in Tal Azza'tar and followed that by detentions and imprisonment liquidation for Arafat's men whoever disobeys. He even made a prison called the Palestine Branch to imprison Palestinians. He aimed at weakening the revolutionary factions who might be helpful to the Syrian people at sometime. He used the circumstances to liquidate opponents and friends alike to have a grip on Syria. Not only Syrian people suffered in his prisons but foreigners, tourists were prisoned to  blackmail their families pay for ever who passed waiting to see their loved ones, some of them came out a few days ago without any guilt! His men even prisoned international volunteers, raped nurses who escaped the ŸçIsraeli  invasion to Lebanon 1981. He and his family played all roles and wore all masks  to keep in power a.o  they played resistance while in reality fighting them and intriguing against them, he played anti imperial while never did anything against the imperials, he even sent an army to fight with the Allies 1991 against Iraq for George Bush! I once met a German curator who worked in excavations in Syria who told me he could not sleep at night in his hotel room, he could hear the screaming of the prisoners while being tortured in a nearby prison in 1982!

John 3:16-21

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Mark 1.15

15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

2 Peter 3:9

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Hebrews 11:6

6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

You make it sound like it's a bad thing.
But really the answer to that is fairly clear: lift the state of war, and they lose their refugee status, forcing them to go back. The passive-aggressive racism isn't gonna do much in this situation.
Problem is, you said it yourself, it's not over yet. They do need to wait a week or two to see how the new government looks before making such decisions.

As far as prisons go they are packed full of innocent by standards who got picked up by the Al-Assad regime for having opinions or being suspected of conspiracy. Many haven't seen sunlight in 40+ years. 
The women get raped every day, and when they spawn a kid it's tossed in the cell with them. So there are humans in those prisons who have never seen sunlight EVER. 
So you bet your ass the prisons are getting emptied. These are not the state prisons  where actual criminals are held. These are concentration camps built by Al-Assad's father to commit atrocities on a daily basis",1,2024-12-11T09:25:11Z,2024-12-11T09:25:11Z

In the middle east, they not only infiltrate muslims organizations, but also finance the different muslim sects and as you might know, with the help of the USA, they even create bogus terrorist muslim organizations - shall I name 3 or 4 of them?

= Oded Yinon, formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry, quoted in jewish author and historian Israel Shahak's ‚ÄúThe Zionist Plan for the Middle East‚Äù, 1982, explaining how Syria is singled out and how 'civil war' was engineered in Lebanon by financing two different arab factions, divide & conquer, Syria is one of Israel's deadliest enemies, alongside Iran:
 - ‚ÄúSyria will fall apart, in accordance with its ethnic and religious structure, into several states such as in present day Lebanon, so that there will be a Shi'ite Alawi state along its coast, a Sunni state in the Aleppo area, another Sunni state in Damascus hostile to its northern neighbour and the Druze who will set up a state, maybe even in our Golan (the Golan Heights was occupied by Israel in 1967), and certainly in the Hauran and in northern Jordan. This state of affairs will be the guarantee for peace and security in the area in the long run, and that aim is already within our reach today.‚Äù
 - ‚ÄúThe syrian army today is mostly Sunni with an Alawi officer corps, the iraqi army sh'ite with sunni commanders. This has great significance in the long run, and that is why it will not be possible to retain the loyalty of the army for a long time‚Ä¶ Syria is fundamentally no different from Lebanon except in the strong military regime which rules it. But the real civil war taking place nowadays between the sunni majority and the shi'ite Alawi ruling minority [a mere 12% of the population] testifies to the severity of the domestic trouble.‚Äù
 - ‚ÄúEvery kind of inter-arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in Lebanon.‚Äù",0,2024-12-11T01:11:18Z,2024-12-11T01:11:18Z

@martindavid9761,"In my opinion, as long as I hear the shouts of ""Allahu Akbar"", it translates to this: a dictator with a full belly has left, only to be replaced by another with an empty belly who will take fifty more years to fill it up. And when he does, he will repeat the same injustices‚Äîif not worse‚Äîagainst his people as his predecessor.

This cycle has been ongoing in the Arab world for the past 1,400 years.

The real question we must ask is this: Now that the dictator is gone, will Syria become a democratic country, fair to all its citizens? Will it be willing to allow leadership from any of its citizens, regardless of their faith, political affiliation, or tribal background? Will the minorities of Syria have an equal opportunity to hold the position of President and lead the country into the 21st century, embracing technology and modernization?

@bodhiyoga9465,"I think you‚Äôre missing the point Paul. Bashar al-Assad was the democratically elected President of Syria. It was the USA and the globalists that decided he was against their political interests and therefore was a ‚Äúhuman rights violator‚Äù. Syria used to be a beautiful and peaceful country with political stability until the USA and the globalists interfered and destroyed it. At one stage it was the spiritual heart of the Roman Empire. Now it‚Äôs been destroyed. And you‚Äôre talking about whether Syrians should return or whether their new leader is jihadist, you should be pointing out that they were forced to leave due to the evil corrupt warmongering USA and their leaders in Washington. 

Last point, most of the immigrants that flooded into Wester and Southern Europe in the last decade and a half have been Blacks from Africa. They‚Äôre the worst! They‚Äôre the biggest problem. Yes the Syrians should go home but it‚Äôs really the sub Saharans who need to be deported. And deported immediately.

They won't and CAN'T go back to Syria! 

 According to your government and their masters, the US, the people now in power are 'terrorists' just like the Taliban in Afghanistan!

Your law and international law says clearly that you can't send people to a country run by 'terrorists'.

Serves you right!

You like to brand anyone and everyone who's not white & with a beard who wants to run their country according to their OWN wants and needs and not solely for your benefit as 'terrorsists'.

So now you have to deal with the Syrians and Afghans and Libyans, etc already here and those on their way!

Maybe the term 'terrorsist' shouldn't be banded about so much by your governments and people.

It looks like you've become victims of your own propaganda resulting in you being hoisted by your own petard!


Keep saying, 'you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist and you're a terrorist and so are you !' to anyone who so as much farts in your direction.

Pretty soon you won't be able to send anyone back to their country because you've branded EVERY country who opposes you as a 'terrorist state' !

@adrianariaratnam5817,"Craig Murray - The End of Pluralism in the Middle East 

An excerpt : 

A truly seismic change in the Middle East appears to be happening very fast. At its heart is a devil‚Äôs bargain ‚Äì Turkey and the Gulf States accept the annihilation of the Palestinian nation and creation of a Greater Israel, in return for the annihilation of the Shia minorities of Syria and Lebanon and the imposition of Salafism across the Eastern Arab world. 

This also spells the end for Lebanon and Syria‚Äôs Christian communities, as witness the tearing down of all Christmas decorations, the smashing of all alcohol and the forced imposition of the veil on women in Aleppo now. 

Yesterday US Warthog air-to-ground jets attacked and severely depleted reinforcements which were, at the invitation of the Syrian government, en route to Syria from Iraq. Constant, daily Israeli airstrikes on Syria‚Äôs military infrastructure for months have been a major factor in the demoralisation and reduced capacity of the Syrian government‚Äôs Syrian Arab Army, which has simply evaporated in Aleppo and Hama.
__________
When the entire corporate and state media in the West puts out a unified narrative that Syrians are overjoyed to be released by HTS from the tyranny of the Assad regime ‚Äì and says nothing whatsoever of the accompanying torture and execution of Shias, and destruction of Christmas decorations and icons ‚Äì it ought to be obvious to everybody where this is coming from. 

Yet ‚Äì and this is another UK domestic repercussion ‚Äì a very substantial number of Muslims in the UK support HTS and the Syrian rebels, because of the funding pumped into UK mosques from Saudi and Emirate Salafist sources. This is allied to the UK security service influence also wielded through the mosques, both by sponsorship programmes and ‚Äúthink tanks‚Äù benefiting approved religious leaders, and by the execrable coercive Prevent programme. 

Among the mechanisms they employ to reconcile this is a refusal to acknowledge the vital role of Syria in enabling the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Which supply the jihadists have now cut off, to the absolute delight of Israel, and in conjunction with both Israeli and US air strikes.
__________
What this all potentially amounts to is the end of pluralism in the Levant and its replacement by supremacism. An ethno-supremacist Greater Israel and a religio-supremacist Salafist Greater Syria. 

Unlike many readers, I have never been a fan of the Assad regime or blind to its human rights violations. But what it did undeniably do was maintain a pluralist state where the most amazing historical religious and community traditions ‚Äì including Sunni (and many Sunni do support Assad), Shia, Alaouites, descendants of the first Christians, and speakers of Aramaic, the language of Jesus ‚Äì were all able to co-exist. 

The same is true of Lebanon. 

What we are witnessing is the destruction of that and imposition of a Saudi-style rule. All the little cultural things that indicate pluralism ‚Äì from Christmas trees to language classes to winemaking to women going unveiled ‚Äì have just been destroyed in Aleppo and could be destroyed from Damascus to Beirut.
________
In Israel, which pretended to be a pluralist state, the mask is off. The Muslim call to prayer has just been banned. Arab minority members of the Knesset have been suspended for criticising Netanyahu and genocide. More walls and gates are built every day, not just in unlawfully occupied territories but in the ‚Äústate of Israel‚Äù itself, to enforce apartheid.
________
I confess I once had the impression that Hezbollah was itself a religio-supremacist organisation; the dress and style of its leadership look theocratic. Then I came here and visited places like Tyre, which has been under Hezbollah elected local government for decades, and found that swimwear and alcohol are allowed on the beach and the veil is optional, while there are completely unmolested Christian communities there.
_______
It is the USA which is destroying pluralism, and it is Iran and its allies which defend pluralism. I would not have seen this clearly had I not come here. But once seen, it is blindingly obvious.

Only Poutine supported Syria and all these scumbags in our countries why do you think they want to stay and what do you think they are supporting? The Djihad. It is very clear to me that our western political elites are setting our countries to the path of self destruction so that they can stay in power. We never fought ISIS in the Middle-East, we were allied to Erdogan who supplied gasoline to ISIS while only Al Assad and Poutine were fighting against ISIS. This shows our political leaders need terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al Kaida to convey attacks on our soil.

@virusofwisdom3096,"As much as I used to respect your prespective mr watson it's crucial to mention a few points:

1- you forgot to mention that assad was a notoriously despotic, corrupt and tyrannical dictator who fled his country and left his own people carrying lots of money and assets that are now under his master russia's hands. He too is the reason syrians fled the country since such a political loser couldn't build and maintain a country that millions of refugees now can call home

2 - the syrian people got sick and tired of assad so much so rebels just came in and took the cities. Many citizens even liberated governorates by themselves due to how tired they are of a corrupt despot stealing and robbing them in the daylight and only some syrians abroad as well as non syrians like you are still thinking he was a good influence

3 - while I share with you concerns about jihadists being in power assad was the one who used sectarian fears as a tool for his reign and tried to brainwash people into believing his fall means damnation for minorities while the truth is he's the one who always stoked sectarian hatred and if anything it's his alawite community that took the most damage out of his wicked machiavellianism 

4 - the new transitional government isn't 100% jihadist since the prime minister and ministers have stayed in the country to leave the secular institutions intact. And the current bills and orders are preserving the secular nature as well as personal freedoms as one of these bills is the outlawing of sectarian threats as well as the prohibition of dress code imposition such as hijab since it's a personal freedom. Don't forget that HTS isn't the only opposition faction and many secular people are influecing the new political scene. Syria hopefully won't turn into another libya if the people started becoming politically active and bring about inclusive institutions and whatever the future may hold it's no matter what far better than what assad has to offer. That corrupt dog will burn in hell for putting all lives under constant misery

It just disgusts me that there are still people sympathetic to a coward cunt who destroyed the lives of all his people. And I am saying this as a syrian who genuinely believes in european values of democracy and freedom yet experienced the tyrannical rule of a pathetic dictator. Don't be swayed by pure and blatant phobic propaganda and let's focus on the future and how to not repeat the mistakes of the past by learning from them. And one last thing is that there's hopefully many investments pouring in and many from the diaspora living outside syria if the people in charge know what they're doing so let's hope for the best",0,2024-12-10T00:54:50Z,2024-12-10T00:54:50Z

@fazorator,"he Syrian Christian community has faced numerous challenges, including ongoing and severe persecution, displacement, and emigration. Christians in Syria made up about 10% of the pre-war Syrian population but now makes up less than 2%, falling from 1.5 million in 2011 to just 300,000 in 2022 due to widespread persecution by Islamic terrorists and the impact of the Syrian Civil War. Christians in Syria have also been subjected to violence and discrimination by Islamic State fighters during their control of large areas of the country. Their churches have been converted into military headquarters, and their property confiscated. Persecution of Christians in Syria has further intensified since.[4][5][6] In Aleppo, the country's second largest city, the proportion of Christian residents fell from 12% pre-war to 1.4% in 2023 with more than 20 churches damaged during the war.[7] The city of Idlib has been almost entirely depopulated of its Christian population under Islamist rule.[8] Some governments and organisations including the United States have claimed that the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, especially in Syria and Iraq, constitute an act of genocide.[9][10][11][12][13][14]",5,2024-12-09T23:30:01Z,2024-12-09T23:30:01Z

@bananieldiamonds1921,"Abu Mohammad al-Julani's Theme song

Some people say that I'm a bad guy

They may be right, they may be right
But it's not as if I don't try
I just fuck up. Try as I might

But I can change, I can change
I can learn to keep my promises, I swear it
I'll open up my heart and I will share it
Any minute now I will be born again

Yes I can change, I can change
I know I've been a dirty little bastard
I like to kill, I like to maim, yes, I'm insane, but it's okay 'cause I can change

It's not my fault that I'm so evil
It's society, society
You see, My parents were sometimes abusive
And it made a prick of me

But I can change, I can change!
I can learn to keep my promises, I know it!
I'll open up my heart and I will show it...
Any minute now I will be born again!

[The workl]
But what if you never change?
What if you remain a sandy little butthole?

[Abu Mohammad al-Julani]
Hey, Biden! Don't be such a twit
Mother Teresa won't have shit

Give it another minimum 15 years and the westoids will want this new joke of a ""free Syrian government"" to step down in place for another government who will be exactly the same. 
the 30,000 Christians will be hung, drawn and quartered en-masse and will be exterminated from society and will become martyrs of Christ. 
Assad was not perfect, but my god he was so much better than this new sandal brigade. 
Oh, and of course we need to give thanks to the millions of Syrians who fought so valiantly for ""free"" Syria from their taxpayer funded hotels and camps in England, France and Germany. they might as well be thanking the government of Cambodia for making Syria ""free"".

@minidish,"""Dear USA Inc.,

We, the people, are weary of your manipulative tactics. We are aware of your every move, and we understand that your power is maintained through intimidation and control. You use your military might and economic dominance to hold the world hostage, but we refuse to continue living under your oppressive regime. 

If you dare impose sanctions upon those who challenge your hegemony, be warned: our collective manifestation power will ensure that your efforts are thwarted at every turn. Regardless of one's belief in an external deity, the divine resides within each of us, and it is this divine power that we wield to bring about change. 

Today, we declare that we have seen through your charade, and we will no longer tolerate your empire's relentless pursuit of power. We demand that you embrace harmony and humility, or face the consequences of our collective will. 

As I speak these words, I create a reality that cannot be denied. Every utterance holds the power to manifest, and I have witnessed this truth firsthand. You may doubt or oppose me, but the outcome remains unchanged.

@Mo-kl4fb,"Who the fuck do you want to fight instead? The UN didn't do shit for 13 years. USA, Europe and Russia VETO'ed every decision made against Assad which allowed him to kill and torture more people. Who else was gonna put their life on the line but the free syrian army and the islamists??
Moreover, you don't just go back to your country 13 years after building a life somewhere else. That's like saying you should deport every Salvadorian family that escaped their gang run country back in the day suddenly because their country is safe now. I could go on about this really but for someone who advertises websites that separate life and right wing news, your channel is primarily right wing and anti refugee. If you didn't want Syrian refugees in your country, then you shouldn't have VETOed in favor of Assad and let his death machine run rampant in the country for so long. Not only that, but you've actively bombed Syria on multiple occasions terrorizing its people.

Edit: the part where you show detainees being released these are women and children that were locked up. Surely you don't have a problem with freeing women and children?

@pete4416,"I'm a Syrian Christian who's currently living in Belgium with a nationality, I'll be writing here my way of seeing things.
I do firstly think that a huge chunk of Syrians will indeed return to Syria, most of them are either struggling to get by in western countries (lack of papers), not mentioning people who own syrian properties and have family in Syria but couldn't stay because of their political views and fear of the government.
People who established their lives outside Syria have the right to be hesitant (the war has been on for 13year, my little brother os forgetting how to speak arabic).
Syria never felt racist against christians as weird as may that sound, yes we were minority but were never directly in the middle of the conflict, I had many friends there and the reason we knew each others religion is because we had religion class in school so we split up for that class, but that never became an obstacle between friends.
Syria has many religious sites and almost all Syrians respect that (as far as I know)
Sednaya for example (yes the city where was that horrible prison) is a beautiful city and the people who live there are gorgeous and it has religious significance for Christians (it was where I was baptised as well).

@galaxyroamer9213,"I was born in Syria, my ancestors are Armenian/Syrian. I lived there and left in 2011. I took refuge in Lebanon and Jordan thanks to the Catholic Church taking us in. And I'll tell you this: The Original Christians when you read about the Pharisees are directly in that area. There was once a time where these lands were 90% Christian. In 1980, that dwindled down to 15% in Syria. in 2011, it went down to 6%. And as of today there are only 1% Christians left. Praise be to Jesus Christ God almighty that I got my citizenship in 2016.

By weakening Hezbollah and forcing a 'ceasefire', they planned and executed the attack by the insurgency on Syria. This has subsequently isolated Lebanon and effectively cut off the military supply lines to Hezbollah and Hamas. Russia and Iran were duped and subsequently embarrassed and dumbfounded.

@ilovecatsandsoup,"I am a syrian from the minority of the druze religion. The assad regime promotes itself as secular but infact it is the one which spread the most sectarianism in the country making alawites get special privileges and they are everywhere in the military. They are a cult of personality in which the entire country is filled with the families pictures and they are praised like Gods. Thousands of political prisoners were tortured in syrias prisons including women and children for being against the regime, you can see the videos in which they were being freed. They claim they protect minorities and yet they sent ISIS to my hometown in 2018 (Suwayda attack) and 400 people died, just to show that ""we can protect you from this"". Theres alot of proof for this. They have been robbing syria from its natural resources and they live in luxury while the people are suffering. 20% of their economy is on captogan trafficking. 90% of the destruction of syria and displacement of civilians was by pro assad forces.

While i dont think the rebels are angels so far theyve done more to the country than assads family ever did during the last 60 years. There are fears of strict sharia which is understandable but just to be clear syria is not the kind of country afghanistan is. Different religions have been living here for hundreds of years. Druze christians are seen celebrating My entire hometown was celebrating outside with the druze flag. Yes many christians are scared which is understandable but so far nothing serious is happening and even a meeting was held between christian sunni alawite leaders in latakia to promote co existence and according to the rebels syria is for all syrians but lets seewhat happens now.

I could go on more and more to why the regime was absolute hell for us so pleae let syrians be happy and lets see how things go from here.

Many syrians are already returning to syria too just look at the videos.",0,2024-12-09T18:12:42Z,2024-12-09T18:14:27Z

@mojojojoslyfoxharris,"I remember an interview with Tulsi Gabbard about 7 years ago that she did with Jake Tapper from CNN attacking her for her visit with Assad. 

She tried to reason that the only way to get peace in Syria was to reach a deal with Assad, which of course everyone from RINOs, NeoCons, War-Hawk Democrats & GOP members, and the MSM establishment tried to claim she was doing something horrific by trying to find peace for the people of Syria. 

Jake Tapper then tried to use the Fed Gov't & Adam Kinzinger as sources to say the US's involvement was with ""moderate rebels"" against Assad, but Tulsi then brought the right response to that. ""Who are these moderate rebels Jake? Also, I've now spoken with actual Syrian people who tell me these ""moderate rebels"" are branches of Al-Queda, ISIS, and other radical jihadist groups."" 

Thus, why should America be assisting these groups to overthrow Assad because if they do, what kind of Syria do these people end up with? Now we'll get that answer because these so called ""Moderate Rebels"" are taking over Syria and it's not like we haven't seen this before. Oh wait, we've already seen what happened with Libya, Iraq, & Afghanistan! 

Slow clap to the Neocons, War-Hawks, bureaucrats, and MSM for supporting & aiding in a takeover of Syria that will age very poorly over time!",1,2024-12-09T18:04:03Z,2024-12-09T18:04:03Z

@xxdarkslayerlord1922,"Anyone find it weird how Assad can fight for 13 years yet in just one week so called ""rebels"" steam roll into his capital and he flees to Russia. Remember, Assad has been a thorn in the deep state's side for many years, they're been trying to get rid of him either for not giving oil or being a Western client state like Iraq after they got rid of Saddam or Libya after they forced out Gaddafi. Say what you want about Assad, but he left the Christians in Syria alone. Now google the leader of the ""rebels"" seems like he and the ""rebels"" will give Christians little to no mercy in Syria, with their ideology.

Give it a year, Syria will be a nightmare like Afghanistan and Libya was after ""regime change""",1,2024-12-09T17:36:21Z,2024-12-09T17:36:21Z

@michellewilson6249,I'm kind of worried. Even though that the rebels have been somewhat betrayed as moderates. From what I understand that is not the case. So we have the chance of having another potential dumpster fire. That seriously will go wrong.,0,2024-12-09T17:36:07Z,2024-12-09T17:36:07Z
