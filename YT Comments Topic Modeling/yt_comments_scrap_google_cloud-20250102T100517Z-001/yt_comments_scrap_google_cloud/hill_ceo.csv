@PatriciaDryburgh,"I am a Canadian, but I lived in CA for six years, during the mid-nineties. During that time I had occasion to see a doctor who recommended an ultrasound to diagnose the source of my symptoms.  I guess I was lucky, in a way, because I was informed that an ultrasound was excessive and would therefore not be covered by our insurance.  The cost would have been $600, a pittance compared to the crippling costs to some who have been bankrupted. I opted not to continue the pursuit of a diagnosis as we were returning to Canada where I would receive the necessary diagnostic care and resulting treatment.
Our insurance in CA cost $14.0,00 annually and that was the only time I needed care.  I was surprised that having assumed that our insurance would protect me that when I was told that diagnostic methods were billable options.

@arthurhwang117,"‚Äú‚Ä¶. the whole system needs to be audited ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

The whole premise of America is built upon the existence of the ‚ÄúFree Market‚Äù : uncontrolled capitalism which exploits the population for profit is the identity of the nation. The system of the maintenance of power over more than a century has been evolved to protect this. So how are you going to ‚Äúaudit‚Äù, much less change this - education for profit, healthcare for profit, housing for profit, food for profit, pharmaceuticals for profit, war and ‚Äúreconstruction‚Äù for profit, disaster response for profit, human beings as units for the generation of profit ‚Ä¶. ?

The only way I can see any change is if the whole system collapses, so comprehensively that those in power today are unable to pick up where they left off.

@traceymcmahon-v1b,In Australia every year we pay Medicare fees on a % of earnings. If you earn under a certain amount you pay nothing. Everyone one pays ambulance coverage through electricity bills. Not many people choose private health coverage due to paying premiums as well as out of pocket costs . So why have private if you still have to pay out of pocket for insurance you‚Äôve already paid. Most new hospitals have private health care standards and individual rooms for all people to stop the spread of hospital infections. Private health will get your operation sooner but if it‚Äôs dire you are pushed to the front of the line anyway in public healthcare. Same doctors nurses and health care as private. As an Aussie I would hate for our country to be so dictated to by an insurance company disabling the standard of healthcare care received for anyone. It creates political corruption pharmaceutical corruption health provider corruption.

@justinswingle4714,"We should have asked more questions about ObamaCare
By Silvio Canto, Jr.
As a veteran of the ObamaCare debates of 2009-10, I am not surprised that health care is more expensive. Many of us back then were calling for tax credits so that people could buy private policies and an option to cover those with medical issues. Unfortunately, the Democrats got their Affordable Health Care and nothing is affordable today.
The complaints grow by the day. Let's check this out from CBS:
Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly one in five claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",0,2024-12-12T22:54:38Z,2024-12-12T22:54:38Z

@marlenesmall5527,"When we tried to get national health insurance doctors and insurance companies joined forces to protect their profits. Maybe now that doctors are being forced by corporate hospitals to become paid employees and treated as profit centers rather than medical clinicians, they will have less interest in protecting the status quo. If you ask the average person about national health insurance they will tell you about someone in England  or Canada who had to wait for, usually ,elective surgery of some kind. And now with Medicare Advantage plans, they think when insurance companies deny coverage that Medicare is denying coverage. So they've been brainwashed against national health insurance.

There is huge anger about all of the capitalistic  exploitation of the American people in almost every aspect of our lives.  
Adulterated food with addictive additives, the obesity crisis isn‚Äôt just because we sit at home and stuff our faces. It‚Äôs related to the way foods are processed, crops are grown, we have food deserts in urban areas, we have price gouging in groceries, price gouging in fuels, unbelievable price gouging in automobiles, credit cards and certain loan interest rates akin to  usury. 
The greed never ends. We are told that we need education to get good jobs and are ripped off by for profit schools as well as outrageously priced private educational institutions. Then when we fail to capture the elusive good job we are stuck with life crippling student loans that thanks to congress can‚Äôt be forgiven even by bankruptcies. 
The American Dream is dead!

The insurance company reimbursements don't match those price hikes leaving more out of pocket expenses for the patients who do have insurance. Obamacare did relatively nothing to help the uninsured and both Medicare and Medicaid programs reimburse a third of what insurance does. If people want insurance prices to come down, they will have to accept that the level of care and available ground-breaking treatments in the healthcare systems won't be available to them.",0,2024-12-11T22:15:43Z,2024-12-11T22:15:43Z

Imaging confirmed it. Yet the insurance company would not approve the necessary surgery. After speaking to 7 different people, I was told to write a letter to the medical director, pleading my case. I told them that I would be writing a letter, but it would not be to the medical director, but to the Human Resources Manager where this patient worked and it would be about what worthless insurance they were providing to their employees.

@0zoneTherapyCures,"When JD Vance posted that photo of he and Trump serving a Thanksgiving turkey (the US) on the table with no caption, it led me to believe that the intention was feeding what's left of government to the hungry capitalist wolves.  ""Necessary changes are universally anti-capitalist and anti-oligarch. Anti-trust laws and unionization rights. Social Safety Net programs. Civil rights and environmental oversight. But this is what it takes to stop the downward spiral into self-destruction.

Furthermore, I am honestly tired of the tendency to equate democracy with capitalism. Democracy gives voice to the people, who want wealth and opportunity. Capitalism and oligarchy try to take that voice away because it stands in the way of wealth accumulation. Democracy and capitalism are not compatible ideologies. They work against each other. I wish that was more obvious to people.

Oligarchy is why voting rights are being attacked. It is why unions have been essentially wiped out. It is why government regulations have been consistently dismantled. It is why you have been told that ""government is the problem"".

The fact is that a healthy, functional government that is not in the pockets of oligarchs is your only true protection. And that is why oligarchs will always systematically enslave it - to remove your only real guardian. Once the government is crippled, all of your protections are laid bare, ready to be destroyed.""",0,2024-12-11T10:40:37Z,2024-12-11T10:40:37Z

@vidnovoc9815,"I had a private practice with thousands of patients who depended on me.  Insurance paid me about 2/3 rds of the time.  They pay you at 50 percent or less of the rate they tell the patients they paid. I was working endlessly, and barely making it. Couldn't pay off my massive student loans.   Pediatricians, family doctors, internal medicine doctors, psychiatrists, any doctors that see patients face to face have suffered;  patients have suffered and insurance and pharmaceutical companies have made a fortune.   I closed my practice to work for a hospital.  Insurance has all the power.  In most cities in America there is only one health care provider.  Almost all private practice doctors now work for larger organizations which have better abilities to lobby and more power in the system.  The loss of private practice doctors is a huge loss for the American patient, as is having adequate samples in your office.  In most of these organizations you barely find physicians anymore.  The last 7 years, since Obama Care, you have the first time when Americans are actually having shorter life spans.  I have worked at many prestigious places, but  I have never helped more people than when I was in private practice.

@shaneosmera6816,This is such a complicated situation. It needs a complete overhaul and it won‚Äôt happen without some horrible consequences along the way. There will have to be some tough compromises in the quality of care if care gets affordable for everyone. Paying a doctor that has accrued almost half a million of debt and gave away a couple years for residency. Good doctors are expensive and hospitals are expensive to run. Lots of doctors don‚Äôt take Medicare because they rip off doctors. My chiropractor makes 50 bucks a visit on me he makes 12 bucks on old people that take forever to work on.

@ErinMagner82,"What's so frustrating about Democrats is that they always look at essentials like housing, medicine, and education, and then completely inflate the costs by dumping money into the markets and passing heavy handed legislation that forces smaller competitors to consolidate in cartels, and then they cry about how bad everything is getting and ""no one did anything"".  Actually if no one did anything we might be better off.

People don't want the NHS in the USA and for good reasons.  It's not because of a ""corrupt"" government; it's because the Federal Government is not fundamentally created to administer to something like health insurance.

Even at the state level the problem is the payer, not the privatization.  It's even worse when it's socialized because now it's a moral question, and the payer is literally going to decide that people should just die like with euthanasia in Canada.  The same propaganda is promoted to sell both ideas and ultimately it's more about abuse of power and personal autonomy than it is about the struggle to pay for medical services.",0,2024-12-10T04:50:49Z,2024-12-10T04:56:08Z

@FlyingDoctorC,"Agree the whole system needs to be re-worked from education to training, to job salaries and expectations of both providers and patients. Japanese citizens expect only 5 mins of doctor time per visit. all other countries with universal healthcare system pay about 45% tax on a US equivalent salary of 75-80K. Imagine half your salary goes to govt for healthcare. HEALTHCARE = UNLIMITED DEMAND for limited resources (doctors, nurses, facilities, drugs, supplies). at least for iphones the demand sharply drops if everyone as one iphone. with healthcare the demand is unlimited. 

Personally, i find it best for only a VERY BASIC universal healthcare system via government healthcare savings account; if you do not use that money wisely, it is your fault and you have to make up the difference with your own money or by private insurance based upon your health record. if you are obese, many illness, yes it is going cost more to insured you, just like if you have a bad driving record it's going to cost more.",0,2024-12-10T04:26:15Z,2024-12-10T04:26:15Z

Healthcare should be about healing, not profiteering.

I have lived in Euorpe for 15 years total in multiple countries

Why? Because it doesn't work.

It helped break the USSR. It is breaking Europe becaue it relies on a healthy populationa and a growing population.

These privste clinics in Europe are primarily docotrs thet went to US medical schools to study, and then returned to set up the private clinics where you pay out of pocket or pay a monthly bill to have coverage.

Why? Because it works, and because as Europeans say, socialized medicine is great if you had a heart attack, but if you have a slow, chronic disease, you dont exist.

If you think there isn't the same amount of anger towards our politicians don't kid yourself, this can easily happen to any one of our politicians, judges, congressman all it will take is just a wee bit more and it will go up in smoke. 
What your not talking about or realizing is that this is one part of an ecosystem that is not functioning right, dysfunctional for lack of a better word. Poverty, inequality, unhappy society that kills each other for crumbs via gun violence is all part of the problem with poor healthcare responsible parties ( pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, food industry ) all enabled by lobbying our government so they are all responsible and therefore they all need to be fixed to solve the problem of healthcare. By doing that, perhaps we can tackle education system, (public schools, college, continuing education) just these two things could go a long long way to level the playing fields in society so that maybe inequality wouldn't be so bad. I guarantee you, if society were happier because we fixed those two issues, then the issue of gun violence will solve itself, probably to a statistically insignificant level because the reality is, much of those number of gun violence are suicides.",2,2024-12-09T18:11:54Z,2024-12-09T18:11:54Z

@DarkHorseSki,"Having been a customer (not by choice) of UnitedHealthcare, I wasn't surprised, at all, that someone finally snapped in a manner that might have some impact.  If I knew who that guy was, I would NOT give him up.  Jury nullification is a thing, so is nullification by the population.  And the ignorance of thinking that UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE would be cheaper is just ignorant.  The real answer is to get government out of subsidizing healthcare insurance and let people get back to just carrying catastrophic coverage.  We know from several examples that markets would revert back to reasonable prices on things.  The idea that Medicare works is beyond ignorant.  The current unfunded future liability of Medicare is nearly 2x the current total national debt.",4,2024-12-09T17:07:13Z,2024-12-09T17:11:20Z
