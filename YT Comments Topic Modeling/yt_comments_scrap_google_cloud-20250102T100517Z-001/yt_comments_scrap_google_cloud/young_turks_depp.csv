@kellykilfeather,"The *most* important piece of audio from the trial, which none of the media have focused on was the audio where Amber is furiously berating Depp because, in her words, ‚Äúevery time‚Äù there‚Äôs a fight, he leaves, runs away, goes to one of his other houses. ‚ÄúEvery time‚Äù. When he points out that it‚Äôs because she gets physically abusive and therefore he has to leave, she argues with him that he even leaves even before she gets physical.
That is how she characterises their fighting. Him leaving as soon as, or before, it gets physical. That‚Äôs the pattern of their arguments that she describes, in her own words, in her own audio. And she‚Äôs furious with him for leaving, for de-escalating, for not staying and continuing the fight. He was not abusive. She was.

@perkalov,"This is called projecting...
There are tons of examples of various ""anti SJW's"" that spoke up and said that ""believe all women"" is insane and sexist.
From the top of my head... Sargon of Akkad, Thunderfoot, Amazing Atheist, Karen Straughan, Milo Yiannopoulos... all said something along those lines and there where plenty more. On YT they where in the hundreds. Yes, I know... You do not share their view in anything, but you are now... 5-10 years later coming the the conclusion they made before this was at its peak.

TYT on the other hand didn't since you needed (and still needs) to cater to that part of internet.Out of greed or lets call it self preservation, you chose to push the feminist agenda to the extreme. If you (and other ""leftist media"") had chosen the reasonable path, we would maybe not going from extreme to extreme.  This is the leftists medias doing, catering to a fringe part of feminism. You are the ones who have helped condemn people in the public court. You have driven the pendulum to the extreme and now you are worried it might come back and bite us in the arse? 
It took a public case to get you to realize that its a bad idea to support anyone without evidence. Even then you are still hesitant and are basically doubling back, after claiming it is a correct verdict.

Witch hunts is a bad idea, even outside of Salem. But as long as you are going to cater to the outer left, you are going to push for witch hunts.
The political climate in US is polarized, but the far right/Trump is not the only ones doing the job of keeping it so.
To an outside it seem to be about 45% leftist nutcases and 45% rightwing nutters and a confused 10% in the middle and no one to represent the 10% in the actual politics.

No sane person claims that everyone that claims to have been abused (domestically or otherwise) is lying. But we have been telling you for 10 years straight that some are and we need to know who are falsely accused before we convict them (In the public court).",8,2022-06-13T00:45:49Z,2022-06-13T00:45:49Z

@rachelprice4546,"Good job Ana... You did better with this video than a video from a few weeks ago and i appreciate you for that. Amber Heard is a disgusting and vile person and unfortunately there are lots more like her, both men and women, running rampant in this world. I, from the beginning of this whole ordeal, didnt believe Johnny was an abuser and im ecstatic he was vindicated. Im happy his win has brought a light onto men being victims also... I myself have dealt with abuse in relationships √†nd also in one of my previous jobs and My best friend, who is a man, is a victim to the same extent as Johnny minus losing a finger so details in this case hit very close to home. Also i agree with getting rid of the guilty until proven innocent mentality and that all claims are of course taken seriously but are extensively verified so that no one has to endure what they havent deserved. And everyone who continues to defend the false accuser does need to get an psych evaluation done because there is something seriously wrong with their thought process and obviously needs some theraputic help. The amount of enabling from all involved on her behalf is absolutely appalling and need to be held accountable for their contributions with attempting to validate her lies. Amber will NEVER take accountability for a single thing shes done nor will she acknowledged shes the one at fault for her downfall. Along with so many others, i have serious concerns about her daughter's well being as she grows up in ambers care. One can only hope there will be some kind of close monitoring with that and people have the balls to intervene if need be.",12,2022-06-09T21:10:26Z,2022-06-09T21:10:26Z

@kattastrophe7240,"I was wondering if TYT was going to cover this at all, since they neglected to cover what came out in 2020. Thing is, I think this is the fairest take from a channel that was definitely more pro-Amber earlier on in the timeline of events surrounding this story. Both vids they put out on this trial acknowledge what came out, so I gotta give some credit there. They weren‚Äôt covering this story daily like over in the LawTube niche so if they went over every painstaking key point from the 6+ weeks, the vid would be hours and hours long.

(That said, I do wish there would have been explicit mention of the photo evidence from her being deeply in question- right down to the same photos being used twice with slight visual differences in color tone‚Ä¶ and two being taken at the same date, hour, minute, & second.)

I had made the assumption of the worst when it came to what TYT‚Äôs take would be, and maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm more forgiving on what they‚Äôve put out on this trial. Maybe it‚Äôs because I saw some neutral parties‚Äô (they had no familiarity with the case at all going into it) struggles navigating the trial. Even I had my issues, despite having kept tabs on it for years & having figured out where I stood. 

One of the hardest things a lot of the neutral parties covering it had was coming to accept Amber grossly exaggerated & embellished whatever- if anything at all- happened in that relationship. Cenk and Ana aren‚Äôt wrong to say Johnny was fully innocent‚Äî I actually agree.

Though, I would go a step further than they do. To me, the evidence seems to support a reactionary response to the abuse and torment Amber subjected him to. She would essentially corner him by refusing to let him leave any confrontation at any given time. I see it as fight or flight. It doesn‚Äôt make any of what he may have potentially done right, but it definitely explains it.

For any of us who were or have been on the side of JusticeForJohnny, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge Johnny was not without faults. It was there in a text where he apologized for ‚Äúthe heinous slinging insults‚Äù he delivered at one point in time. Recognizing he likely had instances where he lashed out, even if just verbally, is important. See above; it was reactionary. There‚Äôs more than enough evidence that was presented that indicates he was not the dominant aggressor. He‚Äôs no saint and he never painted himself as one; we can‚Äôt make like he was either.

Lastly, I wanna say Ana kind of hit the nail on the head about the bad actors on the right. Her mention of this at the end of the video lines up pretty well with my thoughts on whatever possible fallout is occurring regarding this verdict. I took Amber‚Äôs allegations seriously and kept an eye on all things I could find on this case over multiple years. I didn‚Äôt want to consider either side guilty right out the gate; I wanted to make an informed opinion.. I hesitated to voice my thought of Johnny being predominantly innocent & a likely victim of dv out of concern I‚Äôd be considered biased despite the endless research I‚Äôd done on my own. 

One of the biggest takeaways of this trial should be that maybe there shouldn‚Äôt be a rush to judgment and presumption of guilty without doing our due diligence. If this was an ordinary Joe Schmoe & Jane Doe, the guy‚Äôs life would have been ruined with no chance of regaining any sense of stability due to the allegations & defaming done against him. I‚Äôve had someone say this case was ‚Äúrich people problems,‚Äù but it really wasn‚Äôt. I do think rich factor had an impact in being able to fight against what was done to him in the sense it allowed for more resources to come into play than what the average person would have been able to obtain.",10,2022-06-08T23:47:26Z,2022-06-08T23:59:56Z
@IzThatit,7:39 - This audio has existed and been publicly accessible for years. If this is all it took for people to see he was abused I have no idea why they had to have a jury trial.

@ThatsMrPencilneck2U,"What's this ""She struck him first?""  Depp didn't strike Heard at all.  This is important.  Women are almost never held accountable for domestic violence, but should a man respond in kind, the man is at the woman's mercy.  Heard is one of those women that attempt to goad men into violence, so they can take legal action against them.  Had Depp struck her, there would have been evidence of abuse, making it impossible for him to win this case.

Unfortunately, the pendulum has swung so far in women's favor that men are getting really scared.  3 college degrees are awarded to women for every 2 awarded to men, and yet educated women are more likely to complain about sexism.  Men know this.  Every time a mainstream media outlet defends AH's it irritates men.  So many Hollywood franchises gender-swap heroes only to show male protagonists as bumbling fools in poorly written films that men can't just let it slide, anymore, like the jabs women use to prevent men from hitting on them.  A reckoning is coming.",5,2022-06-07T21:01:14Z,2022-06-07T21:01:14Z

@jwalk31,"Ana, I'm a little bit worried about you and the show.This was a huge case, for the same exact reasons you mentioned, but you are coming across as if you know nothing about it.  You don't know the biggest reveals in the trial, you don't talk about Amber Heard's demeanor in court, You don't talk about the strategy from Depp's attorney's. And you don't even know the breakdown of the verdict. The compensitory was 10 mil, and the punitive was 5 mil, reduced to 350k.  and while you have it right that this was very damaging to the Metoo movement and how they have been doing shady shit for years now, you are wrong about how this is being use to swing the pendulum the other way.  Alot of abuse survivors have come out against Amber, saying they in no way believed her, saying SHE helped set backed victims of abuse with her lies, and all they want is justice and the truth to come out.  The story is about how her and the movement becoming fraudulent, and how it is important that accusations are taken serious, but investigated. Not only Aziz, but Chris Hardwick, Michael Jackson, Andy Signore (Youtube Screen Junkies creator) and others were falsely accused by people who lied... not just women. 

 I just find it troubling you only took interest in the political angle.  Who cares about this one tweet from GOP's.  They are gonna always have this stance, it's what they do.  And they also use celebrities to make their own points and manipulate.  The bigger issue is.... us.  The liberals. The progressives. We have these movements and organizations as fodder to make useless points instead make changes.  Metoo, BLM, and most LGBT organizations are corrupt, misleading, and just outright not what they were supposed to be.  This case was about taking  things too far and how we need to correct the direction we have taken.  I feel like an island myself because I've never been right wing or conservative in my thinking and actions, but now the left have become too extreme for me as well.  Canceling people for silly reasons, lying just to get attention, and trying to ostricize allies just because you have a disgreement, all these things WE do.  It's gotten to the point where comedians... Stand up comedians can't do their job effectively without being attacked, criticized, or slapped because of a joke.  JOKES!!!  Logic is leaving the left, and this case is the road, hopefully, to making things better, not so clean and PC. Because look where it has gotten us.  you guys used to say, about cops, there is no such thing as a few bad apples, it's the entire system.  Well, we have to take a look at our own system of activism. We can't sacrifice innocent people just to push an agenda.",9,2022-06-07T09:57:27Z,2022-06-07T09:57:27Z

@RoninDave,"Normally, I'd say who cares about the scandals of celebs but this was an important socio-political event wrapped up in metoo. Even someone like Johnny Depp with 4 decades of work playing iconic characters beloved by millions and was rich and handsome was suddenly dirt within days of Amber Heard's accusations. I remember some of the woke twitter mob threatening to block followers if they supported Depp (those tweets aged well). The point of this trial win or lose was to get back his reputation but the bigger point is that if it can happened to someone like Depp it can happen to anyone. The power of accusation is too strong for opportunists and abusers to ignore and in this particular type of situation those would be women exploiting society's double standards and virtue signaling of going after the bad man to save the poor innocent girl. Had Depp not made these recordings his career and reputation would still be in the dumps.

As for Metoo or this version of it while it did take down men that needed to be taken down like Weinstein, at its core it was bound to fail because it was rotted from within with selfish purpose. The first person to suggest the phrase was ignored by the media because she was an unfamous black woman but a decade later once privileged famous white women started using it suddenly the media was all over it. And this version only got rolling because Rose McGowan left her purse with drugs on a plane. Later another leader of the movement was revealed to have had sex with an underage boy. And during that time in the Metoo frenzy where a bad date could be considered something more sinister (Aziz), Heard decided to use the socio-political climate to her advantage against Depp and as mentioned above despite all his advantages, he was suddenly Quasimodo overnight to use his own words.

In the end,  I think this mess should teach us to take each incident on a case by case basis, not rush to conclusions with pitchforks and torches, and to be aware there are always grifters and opportunists out there willing to exploit such social climates.",8,2022-06-05T04:12:07Z,2022-06-05T04:12:07Z

@neryskkiran1820,"Progressive feminist here. I had no opinion or favor for either Heard or Depp before this trial started. I've worked in battered women's shelters, and am a survivor myself. I watched the trial, and I believe the trial outcome is correct. Depp is a survivor of domestic violence inflicted by Heard. If you hadn't already come to that conclusion, then you need to watch the trial as well. I guarantee that you won't look at it in the same way by the time you get even a third of the way through.    cont...



This trial outcome hasn't set women back. It hasn't set back SA and IPV and DV victims and survivors. It has shown that no matter what, it's worth it to stand up for yourself, and tell your own side. This will ultimately enhance the strength of MeToo, in that the movement will not be usurped by an abuser claiming victimhood. It's not 'believe all women'; it's believe all victims/survivors. It's looking at women and men equally. If women can be victims, so can men. If men can be abusers, then so can women. 



I was astonished and so deeply disappointed watching and reading coverage of this case by news outlets that I've been turning to for years. The subject is important to me, and I had the opportunity, and made the point of watching each day of the trial. At the end of each day, it was clear from the reporting that many of these journalists hadn't been doing more than reading other source summaries -- often-time basic facts were reported wrongly -- conspicuously incorrect to anyone who had watch that day's trial. Holy sh*t!



It turns out they were reporting on a celebrity trial. But they were supposed to be reporting on a domestic abuse trial. And they were reporting in alignment with their political leanings, not with the truth. 

As I mentioned, I'm a progressive. I'm a feminist. To hear incorrect reporting that turns out to be politically aligned with the so-called progressive or left view, to hear trusted sources deliver outraged reports about the treatment of Amber Heard, saying she's a victim; a survivor; a MeToo; a representative of DV-IPV-SV -- to hear all this at the end of a day watching the trial -- I feel like I'M being gaslit!  



For years, who's been saying the left/progressive media isn't truthful in their reporting?   I'll tell you who: The FAR-RIGHT!!!!    WHAT the ACTUAL FLUFF?!!!    Those aren't my people!!! 

But now I'm in a situation where I'm agreeing with what my political opposites are saying about the reporting on my side, at least on this one topic, and OMG, WTF?!!!!   You can see how I'm feeling gaslit!!!  Have I been wrong about other things as well? But I have to set that mind-warping dilemma aside for now, because that's a whole other thing that can't be looked at right now. 



Because this is a very complicated case. That the people involved are celebrities is irrelevant, except for that without their money and fame, this trial would never have happened, much less been opened up for anyone and everyone to see.

It's very easy to look at TikTok or some blurb for a summary of what happened. But in this case -- and this is a very important trial -- if you believe in MeToo, if you want the truth, then I implore you to watch it. If you want to know who was the victim and who was the abuser then please watch it. Go to any of the LawTube channels. Some of the hosts have clear political leanings, but ignore that part - it's irrelevant - and listen to the trial. Do some research of your own. 

If women and men are equal, then their voices must be heard equally. Likewise, women and men are equally capable of cruelty, and necessitate equal scrutiny. 



To diminish mens' voices because our own has been stifled for so long is not progress. If we're going to demand and expect that all women who are, who have, and who might have been abused are listened to, then men MUST have the same right. We cannot overcorrect to compensate ourselves for past injustices. We have to level it now, or it will continue to swing back and forth. 

And so, it cannot then be that ALL WOMEN must be BELIEVED. Instead, it must be that ALL PEOPLE must be LISTENED to. We have to listen very carefully. And that -- the listening, is the key, and is the difficult part of this case. It's the difficult part of everything.



Amber Heard got to speak. Johnny Depp got to speak. They both said some awful things. In the end, I believe that Johnny Depp proved that what he said about what happened between them was true. I did not believe Heard. She did not prove her case. Please watch it yourself.

@sf4603,I appreciate the nuanced coverage and devoting time to both explaining the verdict and the reaction we are seeing with rightwing media.  Its very important to me that we acknowledge this verdict is just but unfortunately bad faith right wing outlets are weaponizing it against the metoo movement.  Depps legal team was very careful to point out that they do support the metoo movement and they never posed themselves and their case against the metoo movement.  This verdict does not contradict the metoo movement all allegations of intimate partner violence and sexual harassment should be investigated.  I've seen some left leaning news outlets take a very reactionary stance that this trial is a setback to the metoo movement and im pretty dissapointed by it.  We can't fall into the same pitfalls as rightwing media.,6,2022-06-03T20:06:24Z,2022-06-03T20:06:24Z

@DeadSezSo,"When something has been unjust for a long time, there's a tendency for things to swing to the other extreme before coming back to the middle. I hope this is the start of this middle ground. 

Also, I want to point out something else that entirely discredits amber but no media is really talking about. The photos amber took of her ""injuries"" absolutely undoubtedly are not consistent with the level of abuse she alleged. There is no universe where you have one small bruise from being punched in the face repeatedly by a grown man with rings on all his fingers. Her SA liquor bottle story is indicative of a level of sadism only seen in serial r*pists and murderers. It is not something you'll see a man start doing over 50 years into his life after being a kind, generous gentleman to all of his partners to that point. 

Amber and her lawyers were gaslighting us so hard and in no instance is it more egregious than in the photos they tried to present as evidence of these horrific abuse stories. Now that they've lost, Elaine is soaking in her 15 minutes of fame in TV interviews, virtue signaling in an attempt to manipulate women and victims into believing her. It is disgusting, it is vile and it is reprehensible. To try to make this about all women, as if all women have as many inconsistencies in their stories, as if all women get caught lying on the stand multiple times, as if all women get caught on tape admitting to abusing their supposed abuser. It's outrageous and insulting to victims everywhere as well as to the intelligence of the general public.",6,2022-06-03T19:39:57Z,2022-06-03T19:39:57Z
@NeutralGloomBot,"Honestly its refreshing to see a woman who clearly lied about abuse finally get held accountable for it. Most times they get away with it with zero consequences and the man's life is still ruined. I mean look at how she is reacting to the loss. Blaming everyone else and still doing the ""its the patriarchy"" BS. No Amber, you were jsut a shitty human being and now you made it harder for real victims to be taken seriously. As usual the most radical feminists who hate all men, not the majority by any means, are doing the typical shtick of defending her at any cost, but the majority seems to get who the asshole was here. I just want Johnny to be able to get his life back and quite frankly, she should now be losing movie deals and blackballed from hollywood because lying to cash in a on very real metoo movement is just a genuinely shitty thing to do.

@TheDonniedizzle,"I do need people to remember the power angle though. Johnny Depp is bigger, Johnny Depp is stronger, Johnny Depp is richer, Johnny Depp has a myriad of security guards with him nonstop, and Johnny Depp filed a defamation suit after a woman spoke out (and not when the accusations were made which is also a matter of issue for me as some evidence is harder to find years later)... and you can ignore this if perhaps but there are some issues here. The first issue is that she filed for divorce. Abusers are almost never the ones to choose to leave. Yes, she also got a temporary restraining order and you might believe those pictures were faked but she also brought forth other evidence of prior abuses in prior years. She dropped this at the end of their divorce and they both released a joint statement """"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" a joint statement released by Heard and Depp said. ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm."" This statement came after a claim by Depp's attorney that stated that the TRO by Heard was an attempt to gain financially. This is an admission that she never did do that. She then pledged to donate half of this to charity. Now some hoopla has been made over how little has been donated but the reality is that 1.3 million had been prior to 2018 when Depp started suing people because they believed that Heard might be abused. These charities were particular as well. Next point is that after this time, Depp never once claimed abuse until he attempted to sue for libel and defamation. Yes, the abused can have a hard time admitting it but this gets to the internet favorite audio clip which starts with her and him discussing his altered states and he admits a lot there. The most quoted part is that and I'm paraphrasing ""she can't believe they'd believe a man"".... but that's not exactly what is said. She says its not exactly ""a fair fight"". She's right. I'm a fan of Depp's way more than Heards and based on years of work plus fame that's probably everyone. I don't think he should be canceled over this and I also don't think the evidence shows that he was. His movies were all earning him golden raspberries. They were not doing as well financially and for the biggest films, this was significant. He was acting in less known independent ventures often long before being let go of from major movie parts where the profits had been waning. 

Anyone who thinks she did this for 7 million dollars or to ruin his career is also pretty unaware of how this would obviously work out for her despite numerous articles regarding how people who support Depp do not wish to work with her (and remember he's not some new actor, he's been here for a long time). I don't think Johnny is a monster (This case was monstrous and there is never a valid reason for exerting your power over another regardless of sex but please remember that at the time this actress was 120lbs soaking wet and significantly less famous or rich, so I am, despite this verdict, speaking about him being the one who did so). I think this jury was inundated by social media craziness. I think their love of a celebrity that has been in the limelight since 1984 affected them. I think it's always hard for women to be believed especially if they aren't showing up in an emergency room with severe injuries or dead. I think the abuse might have been mutual but I KNOW the power did not exist for Amber Heard. The picture of her walking out of that court in 2016 doesn't show someone who had the strength to endure marriage to this wealthy and, to many people, handsome man. She also didn't have the strength in her arms to force him to do anything (please look at the picture). 

Lastly, The conspiracy that is posited by Depp's team would take over several years and the end result would be almost nothing.",0,2022-06-03T12:05:01Z,2022-06-03T22:28:50Z

Amber Heard is a LIAR. And she tried to destroy a man just because she knew society considers a man guilty no matter what based on certain accusations alone. And because of that, she deserves to be boycotted. Her career deserves to be over.

A review of all her performances in all her films should just read ""she shit the bed on this"". She's no better than Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Each one killed the momentum each movement had, and moved on as if nothing happened, while the people who supported the movement are attacked constantly by the media whether they're left or right leaning to ensure the status quo is upheld.

But agree with Ana on every point and the Johnny vs Amber case should not be taken as 'all women are liars'. Rather it should be taken as an example of why we shouldn't rush to judge - majority came out to support Amber from the start without hearing Johnny's side and Amber was proven to be lying on several key points (in her own voice no less) and she in fact was not the victim as she claimed. This isn't an example of 'women are bad/lesser than men' to me - it's a women can be as bad as men. In a lot of ways men and women are equal even if women have less advantage physically and how we're seen & treated. But as far as what we're actually capable of and willing to do, for better or worse, men and women are equal. Different, but still equal. Some (or a lot) of men refuse to see it that way though. I wonder how many women compared to men consider the opposite sex equal to them? And these days with the definition of 'man' and 'woman' no longer having a clear definition (and hopefully losing the toxic traits of each as a result some day) it seems ridiculous because not everyone fits in either box. Everyone should be equal no matter how they identify themselves. I'm an idealist but sometimes I hate that I am because idealists get disappointed so much in life. But I refuse to give up.

@jurassictyrantkingYT,"*Amber Heard was the one who hurt the real victims of sexual violence and abuse by not only lying about Johnny Depp, and forging evidence, but also about pretending to be a victim when she is an abuser and admits it over audio recording.* No she's not a victim of abuse she is an abuser, and she hurt the movement the moment she decided to defame Johnny who mind you was a victim of abuse. The fact that she pretends this is a MeToo defeat actually is a defeat for her ego, not the Movement. She is a coward hiding behind the me-too movement because she refuses to own up to her own actions and that's why I'm not sympathetic towards her because she obviously knew what she was doing she thought she could get away with it well there you go. And the funny thing is she still calls Johnny Depp monster for fighting back and not letting her rub his name in the dirt which tells you what kind of person she is. Doesn't matter what the media tells you especially CNN MSN NVC they're all completely bias against Johnny.",5,2022-06-03T01:28:03Z,2022-06-03T07:20:52Z

@krtadjordje,"Hy to all
I am a proud follower of this channel, for more than 5 years.
Also, I am human right activist in my own country ( Serbia ).
I watch this to kinda smooth myself when being down about society I live in and people that rule in my country, to remind myself that tge biggest democracy in the world stinks like hellüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Anyways, cudos to you Anna, you're awesome!
I was just a tiny bit ( a percentage or so ) scared that you will be carried by the influence tgis verdict would have in the USA society ( I mean, I knew weeks ago if won by Depp that right wingers would desecrate social networks with its BS about women ) and not fully invest in objective analysis.
I am so glad that we're on the same page.

Miss Heard is obviously mentally chalenged ( she even received diagnosis at the trial by licensed and realy good psyhiatrist ) and don't want a single word to use for gloating and such, but so hyped that you still have pressumption of innosence and thats the real value of your democracy!
Here, its guilty until proven otherwise, and all the power of the state and court and public institutions is going against you.
Its coruptive beyond comprehension, and only one thing is making us relatively free, and thats strenght in numbers and some kind of EU oversight because we're in the proces of joining ( that day will sadly never cone, but, thats for anothe time ).
I am fully in suport on woman rights and in patriarhal society as its mine, its hard. But I resents false accutions even more, cause its normal in my contry for government to do that to oposition and even more to stand alone citizens and acctivist that are fighting for some just cause.
Just to send my congratulations of staying true, and, for all the conservatism thats getting steam at yours US of A, the truth will prevails, it always does. Its up to us and people like us not to be silent, to have a voice and use it. To have a stand and to be brave to face fallout and all the other BS from mainstream media or conservatives or whatever agenda we ruined with the truth. We must.

@Biggin328,"While Depp has a clear history of substance abuse issues it was certainly shown that he can be hostile. Depp's substance abuse issues are also not Heard's fault thus any harassment and/or abuse that stems from said issues is important to recognize. However, she truly started to lose my vote when the recording of her goading Depp on was played. She demonstrated that she not only knew of the stigma when it comes to men reporting abuse but again eggs him on to report it. Saying it, without overtly saying it, Heard taunts Depp to report the abuse because as a man it wouldn't be as believable. This in turn demonstrates she knew that women are typically believed over men, all the while subtly threatening to weaponize it. Abuse is abuse regardless of gender, but as far as Heard defaming Depp I feel this was the correct verdict.",5,2022-06-02T15:00:55Z,2022-06-02T17:42:30Z

@CL-gq3no,"06:09, ""...there was domestic violence against him AS WELL.""  

Anna should have left out the ""as well"" part of that statement.  Having watched most of the trial, there was ZERO evidence of ANY domestic violence by Depp against Heard and lots of evidence that her claims were completely fabricated.  That is why he won the defamation case.  There were lots of over the top accusations and stories by her, but nothing to back it up.  Her descriptions of the violence sounded like something out of a Marvell comic book movie, but somehow she not only survived, but nobody ever saw so much as a scratch on her.  Her very best evidence was a video (which she sold to TMZ) of Depp slamming his own kitchen cabinet door closed in frustration (I believe his mother died that day) and even that was not directed at her.  Every witness testified that they never saw any signs of domestic violence against Heard.  This includes, his staff, her staff, nurses, doctors, security, doormen, police officers, her makeup artist, etc.  This may all seem like a small detail, but it's important.  Depp didn't win this defamation case because they both abused each other.  He won because it was abundantly clear that Heard was the abuser in the relationship and given the total absence of evidence her own claims of abuse couldn't be true.",14,2022-06-02T13:32:33Z,2022-06-02T13:32:33Z

@CL-gq3no,"One thing does not make sense to me regarding the jury's decision.  They found that Amber defamed Depp with her claims that he abused her.  They basically found that she fabricated her story and intentionally lied in order to harm him.  Having watched much of the trial, I totally agree with that part.  However, they also decided that Depp defamed Amber by saying (a lawyer actually tweeted it I believe), that Amber's claims were ""a hoax.""  This doesn't make sense to me.  The Jury themselves basically found that Amber's claims were a hoax, but then also found that Depp's lawyer describing Amber's claims as a hoax was defamation.  By the jury's own logic and conclusion, describing Amber's claims as ""a hoax"" would be an accurate statement, and therefore not defamation.  I know it doesn't really matter given the weight (in dollars) of each decision, but it still seems to be contradictory to me.",2,2022-06-02T13:13:17Z,2022-06-02T13:13:17Z

@Y2K2PointO,"Our leftist values include defending the rights of anyone who is accused of something, until the facts come out. Somehow, a weird sect of the left has tried to condemn any man and make him prove his innocence in this case. I think the term ‚Äúwoke‚Äù has become a catch-all for anything conservatives don‚Äôt like, but I guess if you wanted to pick a flaw of progressives, sometimes we can overcorrect to protect against injustice. We tend to blindly side with anyone the cops kill, especially if they‚Äôre black. We‚Äôve seen so many examples of cops abusing their power, that this is our natural reaction. However, we need to be especially careful to remain as objective as possible, and to not paint every case with generalities. Sometimes cops have to use force and it‚Äôs justified, sometimes people lie and concoct accusations. 

We need to examine this quick rush to judgement. What AMBER did is damaging to real abuse victims. Anyone who would weaponize a system meant to protect victims is an unredeemable POS.

@msaar1303,"People focus on irrelevance. IF you‚Äôre being beaten, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the abuser yelled or barked at you, not that he was raging in the kitchen, not texting friends telling fairy tales. Evidence of assault is essential. In this case, the AH said she has been beaten several times, sometimes ""unconsciously"", her nose has been broken, she has been violently raped with a bottle, and still, she does not have a single expert opinion to support the allegation. Not even a picture that would witness this kind of violence. The image of reddened skin is not proof. 
I have been punched (once) in the face with a fist and the swelling in my face at the time, the black, blue, green and yellow colors of the face, proved quite well what had happened.

@misterderp4566,"The real winners here are Depp's lawyers -- they are gonna make a frickin' mint going forward.

I'll add that a lot of violence women commit against men isn't physical.  My best friend is a cancer survivor who has a son, who is now 14 years old, with a woman who I witnessed beat him down almost as hard as the cancer did without throwing a single punch.  And, as Ana said, this can go both ways -- men can do this too!  But does anyone think Will Smith walks on stage on the Oscars to slap Chris Rock happened because he hasn't been psychologically abused at home by a woman who is/was openly dating one of her son's friends?

I don't like to get too deep into defining ""violence"" because then we start getting into BS like ""micro-aggressions"" but anyone who's ever been cheated on, regardless of gender, knows what violence feels like.  It doesn't need to be a slap in the face or a severed finger.

@piccalillipit9211,"*I work with victims of narcissistic abuse and I have written 3 books on the subject*

There are approximate as many male victims as female victims - but society has the image of the narcissist abuser as a man and the victim as a woman.

The victim is a person of any race, any gender, any profession, any personality type. I even worked with a CIA intelligence operative and a fighter pilot in the US airforce... 

Narcissists are incredibly professional at what they do, they have a lifetime of experience at being a narcissist and an abuser, you do NOT have any experience at spotting them [sorry if you think you do, you dont]. the only thing to look out for is if the relationship feels too perfect to be true - it is.

After seeing all the evidence it was clear to me that Depp is a violent alcoholic drug addict who beat the crap out of Amber Heard. Yeah she fought back, and hit the a-hole, good for her. He deserved worse. Depp had all the power in the relationship, the money, the status, and he was old enough to be her father. He constantly trashed their home and her belongings. He wrote on the walls in blood. He yelled, threatened, and terrorized. Who does that? He could have walked away but he preferred getting drunk and high and abusing Amber. The jury was wrong and Anna is wrong. AH didn't defame JD because she told the truth. Johnny Depp ruined his own career and relationship because that's what violent drunken drug addicts do all on their own. Heard's corroborating evidence was undeniable. Sure she isn't likable and she probably lied some, but she didn't beat the crap out of Depp like he did to her.

To report on this and not acknowledge Johnny as a victim of domestic abuse as the evidence showed and the jury confirmed in making their decisions reads like you‚Äôre saying he isn‚Äôt. 

Also way to give no context for the counter claim Amber won. They found it false because he didn‚Äôt have any evidence for the claims he had said about messing the penthouse up and colluding with a lawyer after the cops left before calling them back.

@Trinison7,"Anna you are so double standard. This proved Beyond a reasonable doubt that Amber Heard was the perpetrator of domestic violence not Johnny Depp so how could you say it prove that he was a victim of domestic violence ""As Well"". You still want to find some way to say that Johnny Depp did domestic violence against Amber Heard even though there is no evidence supporting this and a jury also agrees. Also I find it very interesting that the only clip of the verdict that you showed is the one count when Amber Heard got a yes in regards to the article that was posted by Johnny Depp's friend. Which was not far from the truth. So you decided to play that clip versus the entire clip showing all the other counts that went for Johnny Depp in a landslide victory. This case revealed a lot about people that I used to admire aka TYT. It shows me that you all will stand on the wrong side of History to benefit the platforms that you support. That makes you the same as the Republican Senators, and mainstream media that you consistently disagree with. With such overwhelming evidence for you to still stay so obviously biased proves that. You refuse to believe that there is a real thing about men who are innocent and get their name dragged down by woman who are liars. We all know that this is not always the case but you cannot believe that every single situation like this the woman is always innocent. That is willful ignorance. And that is so sad that you believe it so firmly. That is why you still go out of your way to try to accuse Johnny Depp of some form of domestic violence because your brain cannot comprehend that he was just a victim and the victim alone. So sad for y'all. Remember when you were laughing saying how hard it would be for him to win such a case. How wrong were you. TyT y'all just lost one.

@nathandowning5778,"It seems to have been a fair verdict  from the evidence that came out in the trial. Just one thing though - Ana mentioned that the trial proved that Amber Heard hit Johnny first. That makes it sound like he hit her back after that. There's nothing in the trial that proved he hit her back. If it happened, they weren't able to prove it. So, basically, as far as the evidence goes, we know that Amber Heard was violent towards Johnny including almost certainly including throwing a bottle at him, which left him with a severed finger. There's no real reason to believe that Johnny was violent to her from the evidence given in this trial. He was constantly trying to get away from her as she was following him from room to room to continue the arguments. A lot of things she said don't add up and aren't backed up by the witnesses including police. She never gave any actual proof of him being violent towards her. The evidence she did give seems inconsistent and fabricated. For example, she said she used a certain make-up kit to cover up the bruises on her face after a particular incident, but the make-up company said that the product wasn't actually on the market yet at the time. So, overall, even though there was some less than ideal behaviour on Johnny's part, there doesn't seem to have been any physical or sexual abuse. So, overall, it very much seems like she was lying.",3,2022-06-02T04:39:59Z,2022-06-02T04:39:59Z

@masqueraidearchive,"Thank you Anna for finally addressing the issues that exist within movements‚Ä¶ there is nothing wrong with investigating a claim of criminal behavior‚Ä¶ 

Laws exist in every country and while all have some that work and the court of public opinion is a factor‚Ä¶ investigating a claim is NOT demeaning the victim in any way‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the opportunity to serve them justice‚Ä¶

Court sucks, trial sucks - it‚Äôs hard and traumatizing and can become your entire life‚Ä¶ but it should not come down to a catch all phrase doesn‚Äôt always work‚Ä¶

Black Lives Matter works because it encompasses the true goals of the mission - bad actors will disagree that it singled out a particular ethnicity as being ‚Äúmore important‚Äù than another‚Ä¶ but that just goes to show the inadequacy of being able to realise the fact that a particular group of people have serious life threatening issues that are ingrained in the legal system and society

Believe All Women I think was hastily tagged onto Me Too‚Ä¶ what about children who face abuse? What about the transgender community? What about men who have been abused? The women segment of this phrase has the unfortunate ability of making it seem like only women can be victims‚Ä¶

In my belief it should be Believe all Victims - there is no need for anymore categorization‚Ä¶

Even in saying that, that phrase should be for Police Officers, Doctors, people in a profession who are there to help someone at their most vulnerable, it should not exist as a blanket term to condemn anyone who is accused to start a witch hunt",3,2022-06-02T02:47:18Z,2022-06-02T02:47:18Z

@CTDisqoTeck78,"Thumbs way down, the commentary here is both ""awful and selective."" As to the verdict, I don't care for either party. They are both awful and frankly irredeemable. Both of whom need counseling and self reflection before bringing any of their boorish, obnoxious toxicity to any more relationships. Back to the commentary and I'm coming after this show as hypocrites. Before I do that, I don't stand with or condone allegations made against Bill Cosby nor his reported conduct. Yes, there are more coming because the courts can't get enough of trying to high tech lynch him. The first trial was a hung jury. The Prosecutor in Pennsylvania then reinserted the same charges for a second trial and got his guilty verdict. All while violating due process and rules of decorum. Which was eventually thrown out and the Supreme Court who people held their loose morals on to save the day didn't broach this case any further. In the meantime, Bill Cosby was dragged in the media and this channel included with backhanded commentary. Some of the people who testified against ""we're not credible"" especially Janice Dickerson. Most of whom signed NDA's (Non Disclosure Agreements) and they had a one trick pony witness (Constant) and pressure campaign (Gloria Allred) to get her to file charges. I'm noticing that Mrs. Ana is failing to mention any of that while giving a pass to Azziz 'whoever.' So please spare me the blatant double standard.

Two accusations were put forward, one by her, one by him. Neither were reflexively disbelieved, which is exactly what I want to happen.

Now, some people may argue that this would've been better if Amber Heard had been disbelieved at the get go. Such people are idiots. At the time that Amber made her false accusations she had already cut off Johnny Depp's finger, taken 7M dollars of his money, abused him physically and emotionally and pretty much gotten away with it. Her articles and op-eds, if anything, created an opening for justice to be achieved.

An abuse victim will now move on with their life, truly free from this crap. That's what I wanted to see.
An abuser has been thoroughly humiliated in public and will never try to pull this shit again (a bummer, since Elon Musk needed the ass beating, but oh well).

Any positive that came from metoo was completely wiped out by a shining example of how hashtag movements are garbage. Good intentions don't excuse chaotic harm without any sort of accountability. Ironically Amber Heard is now the face of accountability within the metoo hashtag movement.,6,2022-06-02T01:23:52Z,2022-06-02T01:23:52Z

The steadfast denial that mutual combatants doesn‚Äôt exist is another problem: there is a huge difference between ""self defense"" and ""mutual combatants"".

Waldman is guilty AF however.  The $2M offsetting award is a joke since it wasn't defamation that harmed Heard as much as death threats, etc. 

So Heard is basically correct insofar as Depp's fans and those of other male stars can continue to death-threat persons who come into conflict with them.

What had *actually* happened in the ""stairway incident"" was that Whitney was almost thrown down the stairs by AMBER while Whitney was trying to protect Depp.  Furthermore, when Whitney moved out to live with Jennifer Howell, she told a lot of people she did so because she was too scared to be around Amber.)",32,2022-06-02T00:38:18Z,2022-06-02T00:48:17Z

So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one's own soul and spirit for having lived and died to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today's people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today's people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial.

@RosaLopez-zw2ff,I was saddened through this lengthy trial.  Every aspect of Johnny Depp's life had to be exposed as far back as growing up as a child.
