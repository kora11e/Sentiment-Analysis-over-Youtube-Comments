@rh5524,Yes people should not hit 1 another I am sick and tired hearing about this case this is to Ridge spoilt people hoping to get more publicity death never should have in public they have plenty of money what is this fight even about this is actually quite insulting do real domestic abused people especially one fact that nobody seems to pay attention to and that is Johnny Depp showed up 2 quart drunk no matter what you are this should not be allowed because us mere mortals would be arrested on the spot but he was drunk for the most of his trial would any of us get away weather nope only rich people get away with things like that that is what gets me the most why are they treated so special always always always if you have money you can get away with anything whatever happens to those two neither of them deserve to actually be in Hollywood and work anymore and it was to say even if Johnny Depp was a so-called victim most people are so blinded mostly women by his so-called great good say neither of them after all days I actually good-looking at least not inside,0,2022-06-27T05:20:41Z,2022-06-27T05:20:41Z

I believe alot of survivors get that question alot "" why did you stay? Why didn't you just leave? Why did it take you so long to leave?"" That's the cycle of abuse. I don't think people who have not lived it understand that statement. Abusers break you down, down to the point you are nothing. Down to the point you aren't sure what your real identity is anymore. You live in this fear because you don't know what will happen next. You some how get convinced to sympathize with your abuser.

@CaliforniaMortgageLoans,"Shapiro is right, usually, there is no victim.

What happened here is that Johnny wanted a young, beautiful, and wild woman to have around.

The thing is that these types come with other things in their package.  

Johnny Depp's problem was a self serving desire, which often comes with a price.

In these types of arrangements, she gets money, comfortable living, game, and opportunities.  He gets the beautiful woman.  Fine, so far so good.

However, abuse was not part of the deal, and abuse leads to consequences, which the jury and the judge will decide what the consequences for abusing a person and try to destroy their reputation.

@jaguar.dragon,"One night my VERY drunk husband passed out on the couch & left a pot boiling on the stove. I was 9 months pregnant & woke up to a house filled with smoke so thick I had to crawl on the floor to breath or see. 
After the water boiled away in the pot, a fire had started on the stove that got so hot it melted the pot & cracked the glass stovetop. 
When I dragged my barely conscious husband out of the house to safety, he tried to go back in FOUR TIMES!
After the 4th attempt, I slapped him hoping it would wake him up enough to realize what was happening & quit fighting me. I had opened both front & back doors to air it out, but it was still so thick u couldn't see more than a foot inside, let alone get enough air to breathe properly.  
After I slapped him, all he did was look at me & say, "" U slapped me.""
I tried to explain AGAIN the house wasn't safe til it aired out. My husband only seemed to care about the fact I slapped him & I wouldn't let him go back inside.  After that, went inside,  laid back down on the couch &  passed out again; coughing the whole time. 
I gave up on him then. I had done my best & failed. He would only have himself to blame if his lungs hurt the next day, or worse yet; were damaged. I waited outside fuming,  until the house was mainly aired out.  I then went back to bed & did my best to go back to sleep. 
The next day I didn't even get a sheepish apology for almost burning our house down! All I got was, ""You hit me last night"".
That's the ONLY time I've hit my partner, but I still feel guilt over it. 
Was I in the wrong even if it was the last thing I could think of to wake him? Even under a possible life & death situation, the rule still holds that it's wrong to have slapped him? Should I have just let him go back inside instead?
Or was I justified cuz I was making a last ditch attempt to wake him up enough to realize the danger?
I had already pulled, cajoled, yelled, begged & even threatened to slap him, before actually slapping him. I literally couldn't think of anything else to try. 
Before judging too harshly please take into account that I had just been pulled out of deep sleep myself &  immediately had to deal with part of my house being on fire. I was in a terrified & desperate state of mind.",0,2022-05-19T10:38:18Z,2022-05-19T10:38:18Z
@cventer838,"Sad!  My thoughts on the AH and JD trile.  ""Sy is besig om haar naam met 'n plank plat te slaan.""  Translation:   It's an Afrikaans expression when someone is busy ruining their own reputation.  It's a bit like Oscar Pistorius, he's the butt of every Valentine's Day Joke!  She's only entangling herself further in her own mess, and she's hanging herself in the process.  I can't see her getting out of this situation in one piece.  If JD's ex-wives or girlfriends ever came forward with similar claims, it wouldn't be questionable that he is guilty, but they only sing praises unto him.  So something is off here!  We know he battles substance issues and relapses, so she could have supported him if she wanted to, not push him over the edge.
 She's a redicilously, immature 30 something year old.  36/37?  BPD and HPD.  She needs counseling.

She craves validation and attention, the fact that she took photo's of JD at his most vulnerable, shows what kind of person she is!  Then spreads it around?  She's simply stupid!  How many marriage has she broken up, JD, EM and JM?  How much of it is true?
 I won't deny that I honestly think she is an exquisitely beautiful woman, but her behaviour makes her unattractive!
I have to agree with Ben, it takes two to tango.  So, if they were not compatible, just drop it.  It would have reduced the drama the rest of the world is now having front row seats to by 100%.  Ain't they kind of ashamed even a little?  
The limelight life is not all glitzy and glamorous it seems, especially if you are prepared to go as low as AH ü§é!  She has forever tarnished her reputation.  I still don't understand how she managed to keep her job while JD was asked to go.  It's Crazy!  I suppose, in the world of having multiple partners and marriages, you're going to experience an AH along the way!  I'm glad they divorced, because it was toxic beyond repair!  I'm just glad they didn't fight on Valentine's Day.  It could have had other repercussions.
My honest opinion, I think she framed him and is trying to push that point over to the entire world.  If it's true that he abused her, ok, but if not, she's abusing her position as a woman to destroy her ex!  Not cool at all.
Let's just put it into perspective, if I punched my husband in the face, he wouldn't like it, but it would hardly hurt him, he's a giant.  If he punched me in the face I'd be unconscious!  He's exceptionally strong and looks like Hulk.  Fortunately for me he's a gentle natured man!  Myself, I'm a firy person, but I would not slap him.  I'd rather say something... woman mostly fight with words.  But those who abuse are NO excuse!  
I think JD is a bit of a genius in his field, so the fact that she destroyed his contract at the time was wicked!  I'm not big on Hollywood movies, but JD is exceptionally talented.  She might have destroyed his career.  
She should undergo intensive sessions with a psychologist to determine if the trauma she said she suffered is true.  
I know a woman who concocts her own lies, believes it and propagates it as the Gospel Truth to whoever is stupid enough to listen.  Some woman have severe mental health issues, so I don't want to say bad things about AH, but it looks like she is acting in court!  Sorry to say.  I've been married for 25 years.  You don't understand each other over night.  It took my husband years to catch my humor, because I'm bilingual and he is Afrikaans only, so his English is ok, but he never understood my mindset at first.  We also grew up in different Provinces, so it requires patience.  It's a world of instant food, instant gratification and instant divorces.  Sad!
Yeah, don't throw punches if your hubby is late for your bday party!  Just move on, I'm sure you'll get over it.",0,2022-05-19T08:20:51Z,2022-05-19T11:25:15Z

@45aubio,"I consider myself a true feminist - meaning I believe in equal to fair treatment of men and women alike, and disagree with traditional gender roles. I am also a survivor of domestic abuse. I also know that relationships are complicated, and don't like to form an opinion on others knowing I don't have all the details. With all of that being said, I truly believe from all of the witness' statements including all professionals who testified along with Amber and Johnny's testimonies that Amber was abusing Johnny. It seems as if she is acting and trying to tell her side of the story as if this is theater, and is just unbelievable. Her testimony has been extremely inconsistent, and she contradicts herself on many occasions while on the stand. I am also not seeing any evidence that proves any claims she has made against Johnny. She has clearly admitted to hitting him, and she has admitted to writing the op-ed.",0,2022-05-12T07:43:18Z,2022-05-12T07:44:33Z

No one has said it's ok for a woman to hit a man, although men usually have a greater advantage in getting away. Women who use other means of attacking men are prosecuted cases garner a lot of attention in the media. AH admitted to hitting JD. However, it would be impossible to have a recordings of any acts of violence she experienced. If anyone could predict them, they would be avoid them as well. So we don't know what actually happened. We do know that JD earned millions after the restraining order, in contrast to his agents testimony. We do know that he had no contract for the next ""Pirates"" movie, and that he was accused of assaulting a crew member at one time, which would make him a liability. We know that chemical dependency escalates, as well as public awareness of it.

I think he was on a downward spiral before meeting her and meeting Amber just amplified it. 

Also all that Google Trend stuff his analyst went on about, well if you do a search on 'Pirates of the Carribean' and ' Johnny Depp' even from 2010 before all this drama, the franchise and him had medians below 25% compared to someone like Nicholas Cage who was pushing it above the 25% out of 100, just wonder whether Johnny could be as versatile as the likes of Cage, in an industry that is saturated and has had a lot of change since the advent of streaming, and  it is not so much Johnny's fault, social media and streaming technologies changed the industry and the old star system pre all this has almost died out, didn't mentality in digital online entertainment economy....not sure many like Depp will have the career they had pre 2008.

Jared Leto is one doing well in his 50s because he diversified and works hard, very disciplined and Depp isn't disciplined, this is hard times, you have to work your butt off.

Also I am British and that whole Monty Python excuse would not have gone down in a UK court, the only thing in Monty Python was burning witches but the whole doing stuff to corpses wasn't a John Cleese thing and Paul Bettany who Johnny had this text exchange with was trying to back out the direction Johnny was taking it in the texts, Bettany said no lets not do that to Amber at one stage and tried to just keep on the witch burning stuff! Ha! Johnny has a pretty bad British accent, for his characters wonder whether that pissed off the UK judge! just joking! I can't see his British accent going down well at my local corner pub!

@shambray24,"Poor Depp, imagine getting into a marriage and your wife literally is clinically insane. Not only is she clinically insane she is the devil incarnate herself, using her clinically insane behavior to try and entrap you through out your entire marriage. You know what I think here is a young unknown, un famous actress who wanted to party and sleep around but needed money and fame. She see's 50 year old Johnny Dep and she guns for him. He sets up a prenup to protect himself against her cause Johnny ain't stupid. Heard knows though she still can get money off their divorce if she claims violence. So she emotionally manipulates this man into insanity (I doubt johnny's drug use and drinking was sell inflicted seems like it was his only way to cope with this crazy marriage). Then when he tries to cut and run she can't help herself. She evil, she has to destroy him so that no one wants him after her. She's the abuser, I doubt Johnny abused her. In fact if anything I would say he probably had to use self defense to keep her from killing him. If he didn't divorce her than the next step would have been her killing him and taking his money and no one actually finding out how he died. She's psychotic, narcisitic, and she had bpd.  Frankly I want Johnny to win his case. However I think their divorce judge should call her back for perjury, I think if there isn't a statue of limitations she should be tried domestic violence when she cut of the man's finger. I also think that she should be charged with fraud. Yall older men, yall need to start passing laws about these women who stalk and hunt you during a marriage for your money. I think if the age difference is more than 15 years than it should not only be mandatory to sign the prenup, but that wife or husband can not be a benefactor of any insurance especially when the man is worth millions. All too often we see these black widows come out the water works and do their worse to these older men who fall prey to a pretty face.

However, the verbal abuse was ongoing The first two hits were hard slaps to my face, and he broke my glasses. I told him I was leaving, but he cried and begged me to stay saying it will never happen again. The third incident was when he was sitting on top of me and strangling me after hitting me several times. I got out after that and never looked back. Years later, a friend of mine was dating a man and I saw my ex-boyfriend in him,  can't put my finger on it, but I knew he was going to be abusive to her. I asked her if they ever had issues which she denied. A few months later he spent the weekend in jail for beating her up.

Also, Johnny and Amber are very close to the same size and he's a slightly built guy of maybe 5'8"". She's like 5'7"" and a lot younger.

The undisputed facts are whilst Johnny and Amber were in Australia, one of them severed his right finger (Johnny is right-handed). The apartment was smashed up, blood and glass was everywhere. Before Johnny sought medical attention, Johnny painted graffiti about Amber in blood using his maimed finger. He then dipped it in paint and scrawled 'Starring Billy Bob and Easy Amber' which is a reference to one of Amber's recent films. Amber took pictures of all of this. Johnny reported to the doctors that he had sliced it off himself with a kitchen knife, the doctors did not believe this as the injury was 'more consistent with a crushing device'. This is mainly because the nail had pretty much come off its bed and was badly damaged. Johnny messaged three different people about his finger, all of which he claimed to have cut his own finger off. Amber Heard has scratches on her arm, this was noted by Johnny's security team in an accidental recording.

This is when things get interesting. Amber and Johnny have TOTALLY different accounts of this event. 

Amber: Johnny was drinking heavily. When I confronted him over his behavior, he mockingly offered me the bottle and snatched it away when I tried to reach for it. Because of prior discussions where I made it clear that drinking was an ultimatum ‚ÄúI will leave you over this‚Äù event, I was angry and smashed the bottle on the ground, hoping also that he would be shocked into realizing how serious this was. In response, he threw almost every bottle on the counter, shattering on walls behind me and scratching my arms up. He beat me and sexually assaulted me. He smashed things including glass and a wall-mounted telephone; in such a rage, he eventually severed his finger some 24 hours into this. I did not realize it was severed until the morning when I pointed it out to him. Because he was too inebriated and enraged to truly feel pain, he scrawled the graffiti all over the apartment, made me feel as if I could not leave, and refused my pleas that he get medical help for at least a few hours. I eventually coaxed him into calling security and confided in my sister about the incident verbally. Johnny does not remember most of what happened because he was too inebriated and therefore blames me.

Johnny: Amber was belligerent with me because I wanted to break off our marriage. She instigated a fight and threw bottles at me. She first threw one, then a second, which severed my finger, by exploding on it. I had a breakdown and no longer wanted to live so vented my emotions by writing on the mirror and other furniture with my bloody finger and paint. I was sober until I lost my finger, and I became shocked into relapse and drank intensely. Because I did not want a public scene, even though I was done with her, I did not want to ruin her life. Therefore, I lied to the world and my doctors to shield her from the consequences of her own actions. I lied to the doctors about my injury, but I knew that because my finger was crushed, it was not a very good lie. My omission of saying that she had done it was because I was in a fragile and frantic state after the incident, where I broke my sobriety for the first time in a while due to her violent attack.

To believe Johnny, you would have to believe many amazing things. First, that he was sober until his finger was severed and completely conscious of the pain afterward. Second, that Amber Heard had inflicted deliberate long wounds on herself that emulate the scratches and gouges one would get from broken glass. Third, that despite the fact that he texted three different people, he did not say that it was Amber who was responsible - he admitted that to them, he was not trying to protect her, so you would also have to believe that ‚ÄúI cut my finger off‚Äù is the same language as ‚ÄúI broke my leg‚Äù despite this clearly not being the normal use. Fourth, you would have to believe his graffiti was not fueled by jealousy. Fifth, and most damningly, you have to believe that an UNBROKEN bottle EXPLODED on his finger and caused it to be severed as if by a crushing device. As we all know, this is not how bottles work. Some fans have claimed to me that she repeatedly smashed a broken bottle over his hand- that WOULD be plausible; however, it is not what Johnny claims. He says that the bottle exploded on his finger when thrown, somehow not leaving behind any other shards of glass on his hand or arms. Johnny further claims that the doctors told him it was an ‚Äúinjury of velocity‚Äù despite there being no records that speculate on or confirm this.
To believe Amber, you only have to believe that what she said happened, well, happened. It matches with the physical evidence and Johnny's own texts.


Both of them have witnesses that testify to their verbal descriptions of the incident at the time. I won‚Äôt get super into that - I think the physical evidence speaks for itself. There is more detail in the incident, but I think I have covered what's most important.",2,2022-05-03T19:55:34Z,2022-05-03T19:55:34Z

@jamesbarker5254,My ex fiance accused me of cheating on her and when she was proved wrong instead of apologizing and us moving forward she decided that I needed to pay because she thought people were talking bad about her because she was yelling at me at a cookout and she was proven wrong. So she goes out to our car chews her lips so they would bleed then she started punching her and slapping her face. She then called the police to report an assault. I had walked down to the car to talk to her and when it saw her if thought that someone had attacked her then the police pulled up pull there guns out cuff me and off to jail I got. I eventually was found innocent because they had taken pictures of a hand print on the side of her face and it didnt match mine but matched hers perfectly. Also there was a camera on the light pole is had parked next to and the video showed everything.

She just would not leave him alone and she always escalated any argument to the point that would push the most calm gentle person over the edge.¬† Kind of like torture, which to me is abuse. I don't think he ever physically hurt her and only used words to hurt her when he couldn't take it anymore which took a great deal of work and constant pushing on her part.

@sithyarael6807,When this first came out about them I was not on either ones side. I know Depp has made some very bad choices in his life with drugs and drinking. And having been in a relationship with a crazy chick like her I sure as hell didn't take her side. Yet over the course of this trial I stand with Depp. He might be crazy yet her crazy is 100x worse. Guess I didn't realize that Depp is a very eccentric personality which probably lead to me thinking he is crazy. Watching a lot of it if I was on the jury he wins no questions asked. I did love it when her attorney was asking a witness a question then objected to his own question. Damn I was rolling.

@ProgressIsTheOnlyEvolution,"Hitting, punching and beating is not the same thing, its important to note that Depp is trying to make these nuances about his drug abuse, then it is only fair to do this about Heards hitting. Hitting is like a slap, punch is like a closed fist, and beating is repeated hitting to the point of leaving marks, broken bones, cuts etc. There is a difference. Depp is bigger than Heard and could easily beat her up, so it is not very honest to claim that Heard or any other woman could beat up Depp or that he would just let that happen. Hit and punch maybe, but beat up..not a chance. Depp may act like a baby but he isn't one. Babies don't do drugs, punch walls or destroy couches.

And about the defaming and Depp's career vs Heard's career this is not really true either. Depp has made far more money than Heard and who in their right mind would hire either of them for a lead role? Depp was not really big until Pirates of Caribbean which is a Disney movie and Depp certainly does not fit the disney image, and Heard really only landed the Aquaman/Justice League kind of role. Both of them are hugely overrated, and after a scandal like this why would a big movie company take a chance on either of them? I couldn't.

So, three inches and 25lbs,  which isn't all that much of a difference but for the fact Amber has typical upper body strength  for a woman, which means her punches are more emotionally hurtful than injurious. 
Nevertheless, Depp is legally correct, all deserve due process under the law.

@D-Kross,"I have been there as well. People say that you should just leave, easy as that. Well, it's not that easy, advice on the other side of the fence, that's the easy part. There's so much more to it...you can't believe what is actually happening, you can't believe that, this person you love is behaving this way. You want to leave but you can't, you hope things get better because you still care. There's a fear when it comes to just walking away. With me, I just thought that, if I leave, what is she gonna do? Is she gonna lie even more to friends, family...police? I was lucky, in a way, to just be a normal guy, no money to be taken from me, but I did fear for my well being, because you can't just react, fear for losing my job and I almost lost all my friends. 
I kept it all to myself in embarrassment and for fear no one would believe me. The amount of times I got kicked, punched and shouted at, for no reason were more then I want to admit. You try to stop it somehow, you try to understand and ask why, ""why are you doing this?"" All I got was ""you know why"". The passive aggressiveness and the mental damage can be even worse than any punch or kick or scream, it can really challenge everything you stand for and take you to breaking points. The story goes much deeper of course, but getting accused of hitting her when the opposite is happening cause even if I tried to stop it, it would just make it worse or I could actually go past the point of the accusation against me being true. So what do you do? When will people understand the real meaning of domestic abuse and what it means for a guy to take this from someone you loved and sharing a life with? Afraid to tell my mom, friends and have people on the other side believing you are a piece of s***.

I know all too well what it's like to be abused by a woman and have the law do nothing about it. As in the courts and laws eyes, women cant abuse men and if they do they deserved it and it was our fault.
And the worst part is because were males and were bigger and stronger than women, we should of been able to stop it.
Then theirs the stupid male mentality, that if a woman rapes you, why are you complaining at least you got something out of it.
And that opinion needs to change pretty damn quick. As more males need to stop being abused and start speaking up and start to push back and have these women charged, because if we don't things will only get worse.
If we can't abuse them, then they shouldn't have the right to abuse us or get away with it.

As a Dv survivor, I saw this coming for him. I called her on this at the beginning, to my family. I saw right through her and actually feel sad that I was ultimately right. She is an abhorrent human being, despicable woman and she should go to jail for blatant lies. As should a women who falsely accused men of abuse, but also, she should be punished for the domestic abuse and mental abuse she has been accused of and proven to have committed. Abuse is abuse, men can be victims of spousal abuse. No one should get away with it. The pathetic expectation that a woman should be able to hit a man and not have any retaliation is disgusting. They should be treat by law, as any man would be.  It should be written in to law and I bet many of them would rethink their belief and actions. Abuse by anyone, to anyone should be dealt with to the heaviest of possible punishment and should be at the minimum, a jail term in accordance with the level of abuse. I hope this makes it impossible for AH to get work from now on, but I doubt that will be the case.

However I know that I would fall completely over the edge and even with 13 years and everything to lose I would relapse completely if I had to sit in the room with my abuser discuss my addiction my medical history my abuse from my youth and walk through each and every trauma I experienced with my abuser while being called a monster. I feel so sorry for Johnny Depp. No one deserves what he's going through. But he absolutely could not let her walk away and continue to bury him when the agreement had been that once he paid her off in the divorce she was supposed to leave him alone completely. it had to end somewhere. And go figure while he's suing her for 50 million she's suing him on a countersuit for 100 million. And while she says to the national television shortly after her divorce that she ""has decided to donate half of the money she got for her divorce in a total of 7 million to the children's hospital and the other half to the ACLU; I wanted nothing,"" she said. Nothing. But yesterday we found out that she not only ended up with close to 15 million she requested the three penthouses he's owned for going on 20 years a range Rover and all of her attorneys fees paid and she wanted to be compensated a million dollars basically for every month that they had been together. Making sure that she would be secure in her future. We had no idea what she really gained. And she pocketed all 7 million because it was Elon musk that helped cover the cost of the ACLU and it still doesn't completely covered. I truly think she only got back with him to cover that. I have cptsd to the fact that I can't go into public places alone and certain sounds smells and even looks that I see in people's eyes make me feel everything from nauseated to completely insane like I'm leaving my own body. but I think the worst of it is when I go into flashbacks and I'm in public and everyone can see me break down and it looks like I'm there but no one's home. It's terrifying for people who see it and it's terrifying for myself. And it's very embarrassing when you come out of it. I saw her fake her little jumps at the sound of the cabinet doors closing when that video she illegally took in his home of him slamming cabinet doors was playing. So you're telling me she can stand the sound of his voice she can stand him sitting in a room and she can listen to him and her yelling back and forth without any reaction cold turkey Stone face. but she can't handle the slamming of a cabinet door? Something that had no connection to any abuse claims that she had? she decided to react to the wrong video. I know it was something her lawyers told her to do to react as a person with PTSD but that's not how we act. We might rip the bottom of our chairs we might choose the sides of her faces we might lock our Jaws to the point that we get headaches and migraines. it's time to admit but I've even thrown up in my mouth from Total nervousness. and it makes no sense to those around me and it's really hard to say out loud. Being behind the internet makes everything a little softer. This woman of all the women and men that I have met in survivor groups and in therapy and in counseling and volunteering, this woman is not a part of us. And she needs some serious psychiatric help.

Went through 7 of those and none of them stuck. Got to a point where my own lawyer would do them for free because she knew i was getting the shit end of every stick she threw at me. The prosecutor even stopped taking them because he knew it was BS. Justice for Depp. I hope you come out of this on top. I miss you as Grindleward,0,2022-04-30T03:12:12Z,2022-04-30T03:12:12Z

@pafakell,"I still like a lot of Depp's old movies and I don't think I've ever seen one with Heard, and even though I've never been a ""fan"", I've always wished him the best and believed he earned his charmed life with his beautiful family in France despite him spewing his anti-American rhetoric from his French castle on the Riviera whenever he got the chance.¬†

However, if you're going to be honest with yourself, you should see that Depp did a pretty good job of ruining his career himself. I haven't watched much of this trial except maybe a few clips on You Tube from my feed that are obviously meant to make Heard look bad, but I have been keeping up with Fox News live coverage summaries, and from what I understand, Depp admitted at some point in the past that he became addicted to pain pills for about 6 years after being injured on the set of the 4th PotC. When he filed his zillion dollar lawsuit against The Sun was when Disney dumped him, and someone from Disney just testified that it was the many lawsuits he was filing for things he himself was responsible for that was the reason they dumped him even though this witness later added that it was mostly the abuse allegations that Depp apparently didn't think were a big enough deal to defend himself against during the divorce  proceedings. The fact of the matter is that fewer and fewer people were paying to see each successive PotC movie (which were boring and where Depp took Captain Jack over the top into ham land), The Libertine was a repulsive movie, nobody cared about Neverland where Depp defended the rumored kiddie diddler he was playing as no big deal, nobody wanted to see The Rum Diaries, many people were disgusted when he showed himself to be part of the Free the Victimized Brilliant Roman Polanski defense gang, and lots of people turned away and never looked back when he joked about assassinating PotUS Trump.¬†

Btw, the drug addiction doctor who dumped Depp as a patient testified that Depp told him over the phone that he had just cut his own finger off, and when the doctor hurried over to Depp's home, he found him writing on the walls in blood with his stub - though you wouldn't know this doctor even existed from listening to all the Depp worshippers and men's rights activists peeing their panties with glee at the thought that now they have females where they want them despite their compadres throwing acid in little schoolgirls' faces in Afghanistan.",0,2022-04-29T17:42:11Z,2022-04-29T17:42:11Z

@liamr194,"In my opinion (and my opinion only) society has shunned and silenced men that complain about DV for far too long. The vitriolic hatred being directed at Amber Heard from women sits quite uncomfortably for me, because I know many men who stood accused of abuse and paradoxically showed their vulnerability to me (and other men) about how THEY felt they had been equally if not more abused but had been shunned, shouted at and denigrated by a supporting cast of enablers who propped up a Narcissistic female.

@jamiedaulton3541,"A woman says she was abused and they boycott the man suspected to be involved.

It‚Äôs sick. Women should be criminally charged for making false allegations. As a survivor of some pretty horrific domVilence myself, I at first felt for AH however after watching a short amount of the trial I completely changed my stance. To treat JD like that throughout their relationship and then turn around and destroy his career by using her actions against him is beyond disturbing. Lastly, she clearly had been planning to ruin him because from my understand he had very little as far as recordings and pictures yet she documented every not so pretty moment he had and at his lowest points during the entirety of their relationship.

@Hyperslob,"‚Äútruth wand‚Äù wtf? üòÜ they had a dysfunctional and un healthy relationship it was toxic for the both of them. But the facts are Amber with PAID assistance from the ACLU attacked Johnny publicly with lies and that is called DESICCATION OF CHARACTER. Amber obviously needs some therapy and Johnny with his addictions I‚Äôm sure needs to get his mind right also, but that has very little to do with this case. She claimed that Johnny Depp abused her and that she was a victim of domestic violence. These are serious accusations against anyone let alone if you are a Hollywood actor. So they had the police officers that where there the night of Amber‚Äôs alleged abuse and they said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt NOT see any signs of domestic violence.‚Äù They attacked Johnny so bad he couldn‚Äôt say anything publicly and he basically had to hide, falsely accused of being a woman abuser. Don‚Äôt you understand that the ALCU took Amber‚Äôs money and helped her get the article in the Washington Post thus pushing their agenda of cancel culture. That is like a paid hit man and it is illegal. Amber and the ACLU extreme feminist taking ‚Äúdonations‚Äù should be held responsible. If you have a father, brother, uncle or son you wouldn‚Äôt want this done to them. Not to mention all the ridiculous amounts of money and conditions Amber and her divorce attorneys kept sending to Johnny. Remember folks they have only been married 18months, yes just 18months.

@jools7213,"I have been watching the trial and summaries. Some of it was tedious and drawn out by her legal team. He objected his own question lol. 
There are so many wrongs here so I will make this simple. They were married under two years. She manipulated the situation and planned on what she was recording. She cheated on him. He helped her with her career. In the end she used him. 
He gave her a decent settlement, more than decent, from their divorce. She defamed him by wanting to attempt to be in the public eye and lead with abuse claims for attention.
 Unfortunately it now seems she was the abusive and if a person follows you, as you attempt to remove oneself from conflict, who is the aggressor? 
I am aware of how it feels. We run and we want to separate ourselves from conflict, we don't create it, and if we can't get away we block it out as the abuse continues. 
It is not something done on purpose but a learned behavior put of fear. No fight so we take flight. Unfortunately, when an abuser wants to take things out on the other person...there is no stopping them. 
Apologies follow after. The blame to the injured along with the apology. Will make you feel like you did something wrong. Wants you to admit you started it. Even take the blame that you made them react  that way.
She says and acts just like that on the recording.

What is incredibly cruel about her actions particularly at that moment was the fact that she knew he was upset because he found out either that morning or the night before that his mother had passed away and had started drinking to cope with the devastating news (something not uncommon for some people to do) and she decided to film him during this moment. She was calculating in so many ways, and thankfully the public is finally seeing his side because now Elon Musk and James Franco will no longer testify on her behalf(maybe in part because it‚Äôs so glaringly obvious fro witness statements and security footage that she had affairs with both of them while married to JD) and Jason Momoa who everyone thought would support her has now subtly started supporting JD.

And if justice is to truly be just and fair - which why Lady Justice wears a blindfold and holds up a scale - then if a woman punches a man then she should get the exact same amount of punishment that a man would also get if he had done the same.

American politics is a joke and the rest of the free world leaders are watching and seeing what shit they can get away with if America can get away with it. China is slowly encroaching on the world and dictating what small island countries can do, whilst planning their world to take over. There is a horrible virus that apparently was so bad till there was something else to distract us. There are all sorts of rich sick f""s that are still doing their shit whilst their procurer has somehow died in a prison cell and that in itself is a worrying thing, that in a secure location a man on trial can die or be killed, and no one knows nothing. And the biological science is disputed for the feelings of a few, while Children are being taught sexual prerogatives and ideas at a young age, instead of letting children grow up and play. Several companies and countries are trying to get to Mars, not for science or the betterment of the human race, but, for more and to own more. unemployment is going through the roof and automation is taking over, self-serve checkouts, and fewer jobs are available.

The problem that I see is that society promotes the status of the ""untouchables"", which goes against the idea of equality. This creates bullies who think they can do and abuse of whom ever they want, and no one will stop them. On the other hand, it promotes or encourages heinous acts like mass shootings more than inanimate objects, like guns.

@jattman07,"My honest to god take away from this entire fiasco is that due process is dead, and the court of public opinion reigns supreme. If you are a public figure, your reputation is effectively a glass house and social media provides anyone with an infinite number of stones. It feels like Depp is trying to clear his name and get a degree of vindication, versus recouping monetary damages from the loss of his public reputation.

@pennydaytreasures8173,"I don‚Äôt think she ever loved him. She saw a broken man with addiction and childhood trauma. She seduced him, and exploited his addiction. Used his childhood trauma against him. She WANTED him to abuse her so she could be a victim and get his money. She tried everything she could to push him into abusing her. She hit him hoping he would hit her back. When he divorced her and refused to give her unreasonable requests she cried me too. She did this to destroyed him because she didn‚Äôt get what she wanted. 

Do I give him a pass, no he was an addict. I‚Äôm sure he was a complete mess. But so far I haven‚Äôt seen evidence that he hit her. When he was cutting himself (as a cry for help because she was physically and mentally abusing him) she wasn‚Äôt scared he would turn the knife on her. An abused person would have been fearful. She was emboldened by him cutting himself. She had no fear of him. She was the abuser. He was an addict, her punching bag. 

She destroyed him. 

Would he have destroyed himself? We don‚Äôt know. He may have cleaned his act up and gotten back on track. Actors do that all the time.  Look at Robert Downy Jr.  obviously he showed he was capable of cleaning up and getting sober.  Obviously being an addict and living with her was very stressful. I‚Äôm sure his work suffered because of it. You get your finger chopped off, and have to cover for her. Production is halted and then the studio has to make accommodations for you. Who are they going to blame? 

It‚Äôs so obvious that she abused him and slandered him. It‚Äôs so obvious when she cried ‚Äúme too ‚Äú Hollywood and the world dropped him without any due process 

While this case is Hollywood drama it is important because ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is extremely toxic. We need to get back to people being innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately this type of drama goes on outside of Hollywood too. Yes sometimes it‚Äôs the men who are abused. Sometimes it is the woman who exploits the man. Some it‚Äôs not millions of dollars but the stake is the children and the mans reputation. Sometimes the goal is simply to inflict as much emotional pain upon the man and take away his rights to be a father. With no evidence to support his rights should be taken away. 

I do think this case is important because we have given too many passes to women in abusive relationships. If we want equality, equality means being treated equally when you behave badly.",0,2022-04-28T13:37:36Z,2022-04-28T13:37:36Z

@TallYoga,"I remember when I was 19 years old, in an abusive relationship with this woman, and very much a victim of domestic abuse. After she returned from a night out with friends she began to argue with me, which quickly escalated to her spitting at me, pushing and scratching me, ripping my shirt as I tried to walk away. ‚ÄúHit me hit me!‚Äù She would always shout. The fact I could keep my cool would usually make her more irate. After a few minutes of her kicking and screaming, there was a loud banging on my front door. I opened it and it was my neighbours. Mother, father and two sons. The mother pointed aggressively at me shouted, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd better not be f***ing hitting her! We can hear the noise!‚Äù - I‚Äôll never forget that moment.

@Aryana70,"The op-ed that her lawyers used in court isnt the op-ed that was released in the newspaper. The one used in court had any mention of DV removed from it, trying to prove that the piece had nothing to do with Depp nor suggest he was an abuser. But email and text has proven that the conversation with Heard, is that they wanted to word it in such a way that it points the finger at Depp without actually saying his name. Heard had this plan from the beginning, what she didnt expect is Depp to take her to court, she tried everything to stop him, from gaslighting, threatening him,  having hit pieces in the papers written about him. The list goes on, shes tried having the case thrown out on 4 seperate occasions without success, the pics of her bruises have been proven to have been faked, her lawyers have played dirty right through this trial so far. I hope and pray that the jury see how much of a narassic this abusive woman is, just look at her past, she has been done for DV before..she has no eyewitnesses, nor medical records in any form. However, Depp has medical records, independant eyewitnesses, police cam, video and audio of the abuse he suffered at her hand. And please dont use the hes on drugs and alcohol, so therefore hes violent, because she has a drug and alcohol problem too. Sorry for such a long post, I have been following this case for 2 plus years, read all the court documents from the UK Sun trial and all the docs from this trial, as well as listened to audio and video as well.

I am living proof of the double standard of DV prosecution where a woman can use her husband as a punching bag for an entire marriage, leaving scars, black eyes, fa5 lips, torn retina, and a (decent) man still would never hit a woman and then the woman calls the PD says she is ‚Äúin fear‚Äù of her husband and next thing you know he is arrested for ‚ÄúDomestic Assault-non physical, then she gets a restraining order against him-removing him from his home if he is lucky enough to even makes bail and, depending on the type of profession he‚Äôs in (my case I was a Boston cop), loses his career because a ‚ÄúSimple Assault‚Äù - again NOT a physical assault- leaves him permanently disqualified from carrying a firearm. I admit, My mistake was that when the police came on the occasions when she had beaten me (I never called, either her or neighbors if we were loud) and asked why I was bleeding, how I got the black eye, etc., I would lie to protect her from being arrested by making up a false story.  But I only did this because the thought process is ‚ÄúWhat kind of man would have his wife arrested‚Äù?  Well, nice guys finish last I guess.

When she couldn't do that any longer because Johnny got out, like a teenage child not getting their own way or wanting to get one over on someone they don't like at school, she fabricated a load of nonsense to teach him a lesson.  This ultimately went too far as soon as the media got involved and she couldn't take it back.  Now she's caught on a massive lie she can't withdraw.  There has been ZERO evidence so far that Johnny ever struck Amber, instead it appears it was all the other way round.

@kimmyg3483,"Wow Ben, you got alot of facts wrong here.  I have watched every minute of the trial so far, so let me correct you on your inaccuracies. 1. They were recording each other because Amber was denying things said in arguments and Johnny wanted a record, their therapist also recommended they record their arguments so it would help them in their couples therapy sessions.There were NO plans to make a documentary. 2. The Judge DID NOT have to repremand him to get Depp to answer questions...not even once! DID NOT HAPPEN.  He answered all questions in my opinion open and honestly...there was some minimisation of the texts, but no denials. 3. I have listened to their audio recordings (I had a headache afterwards), its clear that Heard is a very unwell woman, and is mentally and emotionally disturbed.  She shows classic signs of Borderline Personality Disorder and this diagnosis was confirmed by a indepth assessment by a psychologist.  My take on it all is that Johnny Depp is an empathetic soul, but emotionally unavailable (all addicts are), when you team a person like that up with a Borderline Narc you are going to see BIG problems. He pulls away, she gets more and more desparate and eventually turns to violence to keep him from pulling away/physically leaving. In the audio tapes she bagered him for HOURS and HOURS, he was calm and was trying to reason with her.  I would have decked the bitch, he showed incredible restraint in my opinion, if you listen to the audio tapes you will get a better understanding of the dynamic between them. I really hope this trial sheds some light on these personality disorders and helps people stuck in these toxic relationships to recognise what they are dealing with and get some help. I had an employee who was in a relationship with a borderline and she was VERY violent, I often used to say he is going to end up buried in his back garden if he is not careful, he is a very empathetic person, the Borderlines and Narcs seek out these types because they are the only ones that will put up with their shit for any length of time.  My advice is if you sense any emotional instability in your partner, get it dealth with by a professional and if there is no improvement, get out asap, they can be very dangerous (men and women).",0,2022-04-28T10:35:25Z,2022-04-28T10:35:25Z

Until you've been in a relationship with an abusive borderline (or one of the other cluster B types) it's not really possible to fully grasp just how maddening and twisted and and manipulative and morally perverted these people are. They will turn a sane partner mad. Reputation destruction is one of the classic go-to strategies of crazy cluster B woman, after they discard their victims. They will spend years abusing a victim and provoking them until they finally snap, and will then use the 'snapping' of the sane/decent partner as evidence of ""abuse"".

People with borderline can and will literally drive calm, nonviolent people insane. 

Ive never punched another person in my life, but dealing with a borderline, where they will NOT let you try to leave the argument, Ive broken my both hands on walls, doors etc. because they just cant ever admit theyre wrong and they will tear into you in the most screwed up personal ways if you try to leave and not be involved.

Calling it a disorder is an excuse if you ask me. Its called being a shitty, terrible person that, from my anecdotal experience, has some really severe daddy issues

Depp obviously has flaws, absolutely. I know for a fact though, that Heard was constantly using any little issue he had against him in every argument. Thats how that goes with borderlines.

@unforgiving6363,"I have parents that are  manipulative and  abusive (physically, emotionally and psychologically) I have seen their failing marriage over my life, where small argument became violent or destructive, derogatory and vulgar. I seen things been broken over heads, cups, plates saucers being smashed, knives been drawn, suicide threats, a fuck tonne of manipulation and lying, covering up and down playing. As a child I was abused very badly verbally and physically by my mother to the point where I had injuries. When I was 12 she told me "" I was an alien that grew inside of her"" after a massive argument erupted because I was scared for being alone upstairs. My favorite toys and consoles have been smashed repeatedly, and I've been degraded time and time again. I never liked retaliation but at times I've had too because I've had defend myself from injury. I'm now 23 psychologically messed up, depressed and anxious, wasting my prime unsure of myself and desperately seeking validation. I tend to attract the worst kinds of people, people who like to feed on people whom have severe trauma. My parents are now divorcing and my brother is the victim, lies are again being spread and situations escalating. He's only 14 so if he's lucky he'll be fine at my age but like me he is now permanently damaged. Abuse is no joke and abusers can be men or women. I understand why women feel on edge with men but I know plenty of women who have been inappropriate with me and know that they can get away with it because of their gender. I have no clean slate, I know I have mistreated people, crossed boundaries and desperately been seeking validation but I never meant to but others who have mistreated me walk free un -opposed where my name has been dragged through the mud.

@Got2Bespoke,"*""Tell the world, Johnny, tell them, Johnny Depp, I, Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence""* followed by, *""See how many people believe or side with you.""* -Amber Heard

I'm surprised that Ben didn't reference the above audio (which is available almost entirely on the YouTube channel ""Incredibly Average"") which was the final clip played at the end of the Mr. Depp's redirect (meaning, questions asked by his own layers after cross examination concluded), which also came after a piece of audio where Heard, who is seemingly distressed over the state of her reputation, hears Depp calmly suggest that they can (even after the damage that‚Äôs been done to his reputation and career) attempt to avoid any more meddling by the media by drafting a letter _together_ that they are going to deal with their separation or divorce in private. Heard follows his suggestion up by seeming to suggest that it would harm her reputation because of what she‚Äôs already made public (the temporary restraining order, which she happened to ask him to violate in order to meet at her request, and the other accusations she'd made against him at this point). To which Depp replies that yes, she‚Äôs going to have to deal with those accusations. Of course, in Heard-like fashion she responds to Depp, who has remained amazingly calm all things considered, in a quasi-hysterical manner about how he doesn‚Äôt believe her or never believes her etc. and that she tried to protect him vis-a-vis the cops coming into the picture (at the Eastern Columbia Building).  The audio goes on and you hear Depp point out that *she* asked one of her friends to call the police (from another time zone) during an argument from which he was trying to extricate himself from as usual and Heard then turns to claiming that her legal team made her say what she did, to which Depp then suggests they should talk to the legal team (presumably to clear things up).  Though, it really does sound like he was calling her bluff at this point in the conversation and knew it was all nonsense in service to her narrative(s). 

Again, you don‚Äôt need to take my word for it. You can go listen to the full length audio recordings on the channel referenced above (who may have actually been the first to publish these recordings on YouTube), or you can go listen to the court recording of the redirect of Mr Depp this week (on Tuesday, April‚Äôs 26th I believe).",11,2022-04-28T02:35:03Z,2022-04-28T02:35:03Z

@Proud_Troll,"Ben you were not harsh enough on amber.
She threw a bottle at him and cut off a piece of his finger (a witness has testified that she asked him ""have you ever been so angry with someone that you lost it?"" Right after Johnny supposedly sliced his own finger), she abused him physically, mentally, emotionally, she smeared some freshly baked hot brown logs on his side of the bed, and then she went out and accused him of the very things she did.

Johnny Depp definitely used harsh words, and insults at time, BUT THAT'S IT.
I believe the most recent witness has testified that he didn't see any bruises on her face at a time when she claimed to have been physically assaulted by Depp, and had shown (fake) bruises. 

Johnny has done nothing wrong. 
Addiction to drugs does not equal abuse.
No one around Johnny has ever been abused by him at all, in fact it was quite the contrary.

@Spider-Fan006,In my opinion I don't care if you're a man or a woman you have no right to abuse the person you're supposed to love more then anyone else some feminists want equality but what they actually want is superiority over men they're a disgrace to true feminists who want equality. Amber is nothing but a manipulative lying abuser who doesn't seem to want to change that let this be a lesson to all children male or female you have no right to abuse the person who you should love more then anyone else in my opinion male or female if you abuse your spouse you deserve prison time I'm not married so I can't advocate for those who are but I know enough that abuse is never ok when it comes to both genders in my opinion the statement that a man should never hit a woman when she does or says something that deserves a slap because men are way stronger then them but in my opinion that's propostorise we men aren't the Hulk yes we're stronger then women but our strength is a minor advantage women can take a hit like we men can they're not fragile they're capable of hitting a man really hard and taking a slap from a man if feminists want true equality then they should know what they seek truly means.,0,2022-04-28T02:08:17Z,2022-04-28T02:09:52Z

They can also see that Johnny was not necessarily a saint in that relationship. He had issues he dealt with but he failed to make right choices. Having a difficult childhood and having been in the fame since childhood could explain his behaviour but cannot be used to justify his actions (like banging all the pantry doors in the video). If you are frustrated, you remove yourself from the situation so you don't act violently. Johnny failed to remove himself from those situations and contributed to the escalations. Both of them were in a toxic relationship.

 But it is clear as day that Amber Heard is in the wrong. I don't think any explanation as to why is required since all of that is disclosed in their trial.

@neuro-3778,"As someone who's been falsely accused of a crime before, I despise Amber Heard.

I got falsely accused of making a bomb threat to my school in 9th grade. I was depressed as hell at the time, but I wasn't malicious. The only person I'd willingly hurt was myself. The events that transpired as a result of the accusation have pretty much been scarred into my brain. The amount of times I got told I did it, even though I knew exactly where I was and what I was doing at the alleged time I did it. I began doubting myself and it started to feel like my own memories were... ""melting"" is the best way to describe it. I was mentally ill before any of this happened, so you'd imagine that those things combined would take a very heavy toll on my sanity, and they did. There's a 15 to 20 day period during that time that's just a mystery to me. I can't remember anything from what happened then, at least not easily. It's possible I was just sitting in my room, driving myself insane. Somehow, I remember the feelings I had during that time though. When I try to remember what happened, I have no images, sounds, or other sensations. All I get is fear, hatred towards myself and the outside world, hatred to whoever did this, anxiety, and finally, the feeling of wanting to die just so everything would stop. 

As you can probably guess, I didn't end up killing myself. I had an online friend who I was in Discord calls with almost daily. I didn't tell him what was going on until a while after it all settled down, but he pretty much saved my life just by playing games with me, and he was completely oblivious at the time. Back to the main topic though. I never got to know the identity or anything about who accused me. Some sort of bullshit US minor protection law, even though my identity got almost none. Everyone knew who allegedly made the threat. The thoughts of this flooded my mind. I was afraid of it happening again. What if someone accuses me of something again? This fear mixed with a panicked logic and I concluded that if I don't know who to be cautious of, I should be cautious of literally everyone until proven otherwise. I don't know what happened to the person who accused me, but that made it worse. They apparently dropped the charges as I was just about to be proven innocent. I transferred to a school owned by a mental hospital shortly after all of this. 

Fast forward two years to where I am now. I'm a recluse with an anxiety around anyone I don't know. No matter what kind of logic I try to use, I find new people terrifying. I hate leaving my house and can barely give my order at restaurants anymore. Not too long ago, I discovered that I have anxiety attacks when near a public highschool with a large student population. I've had anxiety before that around other situations, but nothing that extreme. It felt like something was gripping my mind and I couldn't use logic to calm myself down like I always do. Even when I told myself that it's not the same school and none of them have any idea who I am or even care because I just happened to be near it and wasn't even a student there, the terror wouldn't stop. I got home that day and felt pathetic. Once upon a time, I loved meeting new people and making new friends. Now I've been reduced to a mentally ill recluse, and all it took was someone pointing a finger at me and saying I did something bad.

*Don't say someone did something they didn't do. If you're only suspicious, make it clear that you're not sure. Don't make someone else end up like me.*",1,2022-04-28T01:31:52Z,2022-04-28T01:32:19Z

@canoli62,"People seems to be looking at this backwards.  Everyone seems to think that what this case is about is believing her claim.  

This is entirely beside the point.  The fact that she has mostly circumstantial evidence only is irrelevant.  Depp in this case is the plaintiff, so he must prove his case, which amounts to proving a negative.  This is very difficult to do.  Her claims of abuse are vague.  She claimed to be abused by a partner.  Whether she was also abusive is wholly irrelevant - it has no bearing on whether her claim of abuse amounts to defamation. One can both abuse and be abused, legally speaking, at the same time.

In order to prove that her claims are defamation, Depp must prove that he himself NEVER was abusive.  That is all.  Proving this is almost impossible.  It does not matter if they prove on one specific occasion that he was not abusive.  It does not matter if they prove she was regularly abusive - this that nothing to do with the question of his abusiveness.

Even more importantly, in the state this trial is, the term abuse if VERY broad.  Based on their definition of abuse, Depp has actually confessed to being abusive on at least 3 occasions.  All the recordings Heard's lawyers played positively prove that he was verbally abusive - which is affirmatively proving that legal abuse occurred.  His threats also fall directly into the legal definition of abuse.  Whether they were ever carried out is irrelevant.

I think Depp knows he will not win and winning was never the point.  The point is to restore his public image.  To reclaim his career.  This seems to be working.",0,2022-04-28T00:56:12Z,2022-04-28T00:56:12Z

@nooneatall6914,"Well, that's really the problem culturally isn't it; the world rightly runs to a women's defence if she is the victim of domestic violence, but no one cares about men who are victims of domestic violence; if they see a man getting hit and abused by a woman in the street they would either walk past and ignore it, to thier shame...or laugh at him being beaten and abused in thier sight, greater still to thier shame. I wonder, if they walked in one day and saw thier own innocent son getting punched in the face or having a bottle broken over his head by his son's psychotic wife, would they ignore and laugh at thier own son's abuse and pain? 

Now, don't get me wrong Ben I'm a huge fan,  and you're a righteous man; but on your personal opinion at the beginning I respectfully disagree. No, a man should not at all be put in jail for the rest of his life for hitting a woman. Every person in this world must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of thier gender. A man has a right to defend his own safety, life and property as well as his wife and children's life if he is attacked - regardless if the attacker is male or female. If a deranged psychopath who happens to be female raises her hand to a man to harm or take his or his family's life, he has the right to defend himself and his family against her, even to put her to death if that is what it takes, her own blood is upon her. It is not a crime (or should not be), nor is it a sin, it is righteous. To be equal in civil society, regardless of gender also means equality in consequence for that individual's actions. No one on this Earth should ever think otherwise. None should be given preferential treatment to any other simply because they have a womb and mammary glands, all must be accountable, non shall escape judgement. Remember our Scriptures; not all of the fairer sex are sugar and spice and all things nice, far from it in fact. Bathsheba, Delilah, Jezebel - thier own heinous actions led to the corresponding consequences for them, and in every instance the judgement they brought upon themselves was righteous.",0,2022-04-28T00:06:05Z,2022-04-28T00:06:05Z

Johnny states Amber threw a vodka bottle hitting him inbetween the eyes on the bridge of the nose, this is supported by Johnny's own recounting and support by a witness of the injury viewing it and offering treatment for it. Assuming Johnny severely injured himself is really kind of like saying Ukraine is bombing its own people and cities. Some idiots believe Ukraine is bombing its own people. Further Amber threw another bottle in another argument severing Johnny's finger, which is also supported by highly believable recounting by Johnny and also very believable by the mentally ill out of control behavior observed when hearing Amber on audio recording. 
Amber was continuously verbally and physically assaulting Johnny to the degree he would certainly drink more alcohol and pull back away from her more. 
Becoming caught in this vortex it is a miracle Johnny really didn't lose control causing real harm that could then easily be used against him to put him in jail. 

Johnny is not that guy and typically does not react even under pressure and even inebriated, so unable to get Johnny to react and stop him from pulling away Amber increased her crazy rage due to loss of control in attempts to seek reaction out from Johnny. 
I'm sure Johnny reacted by calling her names and so on, but the Gold standard for abuse or any real physical abuse for evidence that Amber sought she was not able to achieve, although she tried Non-Stop.",0,2022-04-27T21:20:39Z,2022-04-27T21:23:42Z

They were both responsable for the final outcome of this marriage but Depp doesn't seem to take any responsability for HIS actions, he is a good actor and a charming man and can sway peoples judgement in his favor. It is ultimately his bad choice of lifestyle, the alcohol and drugs that is the reason for their bad marriage and he should take his share of the responsability.",0,2022-04-27T19:59:55Z,2022-04-27T19:59:55Z

No one.
And men can be abused or just simply put..they can not fight back. There is no self defense if a woman is attacking a man. And if he was that bad, she could have walked away. She had the financial means to do so. Look at Tina Turner, she walked away with nothing.

@jonnywatts2970,The sad part is they both seem to be emotionally messed up people. Johnny Depp is an opiate addict. I understand that and the desperation that you feel and the links that you will go to and the things that you will say that you regret for the rest of your life. Then you have Amber who is obviously suffering from rage control issues. She's harder for me to analyze because I don't have personal experience. However she is very much like my daughter's mom.,0,2022-04-27T18:43:08Z,2022-04-27T18:43:08Z

@RikoLime,"The whole session is rediculous. Theres video and audio of her admitting to abusing him, and fans are now even analyzing video clips of Depp alone or both of them together, that show the small signs of abuse. (Theres a video clip of Depp and a childhood friend at a dinner, and she asks about his finger - they laugh it off, but if you watch, he turns away, brings his hand up and curls it as if hiding the finger, and even starts shaking. You can see his friends facial expression change from laugher, to confusion, to dead seriousness and a hint of anger -- she knew then something wasnt right). 

The nail in the coffin is that she turned it around and claimed he was the abuser. It absolutely ruined him. But for her? Even though this trial is showing shes the abuser? She still has a job, and everything she had before, but he is still suffering, attempting to testify and explain and  having to live through all the abuse in court. The mental pain he must be feeling reliving the trauma.

The reason the article titles is so annoying is because throughout the trial, Rottenborn continuoously called Depp out for Hearsay, even when Depp had read directly from an article, he demanded Hearsay.. But the lawyer starts reading article titles (that has no proof?), you can even hear Depp say ""isnt this hearsay?"" and the lawyer continues. But to argue his career was ruined by alcohol, and not abuse -- its not farfetched to think that someone abused may go to the bottle to lessen the horror of it. I hope his lawyer brings that up.",0,2022-04-27T18:42:17Z,2022-04-27T18:44:58Z

@Gothiclovesick,"Look, I'm embarassed to bring this up, but I know Amber Heardnis guilty and I'll tell you why: I was never a violent person. I'm a 5' female. I married my first husband at 23 and was very naive and innocent. He was extremely abusive and humilating and would pull my hair, grab me until he bruised me and hit me with objects, ignore me, curse at me, ect. I hid the abuse from my family. When I became pregnant, I knew this wasnt a healthy environment for my baby but I was obsessed with him and constantly trying to make things better but no matter what I did, he would find a way to be unhappy. Being attacked, I began to fight back, curse him out and mimic his behavior with the exception of ignoring him. I wanted so much to love this man and be in peace but I could never seem to please him. Finally when my daughter was 11 mo I walked out when he struck me in front of her. Fast forward 4 years and my 6'4 giant second husband who is literally a teddy bear is struggling with alcohol and anxiety and depression. Money isnt coming in. He isnt taking care of the family. My rage boils over and I start to repeat all the learned behaviors of my first marriage in an attempt to show him I mean business. I would strike him, belittle him, curse at him, mock him, ect. I wasnt afraid because I knew he wouldnt fight back. I hit him, threw things at him, until my rage could subside. I couldnt control myself. I kept reliving that trauma with my ex but feeling empowered because it was my teddy bear husband who wouldnt hurt me. I was wrong, completely but I did bring out some of the worst in him. Once in a blue he did curse at me. Once to defend himself, he dislocated my shoulder pushing me away when I came to attack, which was already injured in childhood. Another time he pushed me. This wasnt his normal behavior, but I provoked him with my overly aggresive behavior. So as for Amber Heard, she is NOT a battered woman defending herself. She has past control and insecurity issues and rage she brought to the marriage and I believe her ex is a victim of abuse. As for my teddybear and I, we are good. I have not hit him in about six years. Because I love him and confronted my demons, I know when I'm boiling over and hold my tongue and get away. He works regularly to provide and we are truly soul mates. Violence in a relationship should never be tolerated. Walk away. Let that person know your boundaries. But I do want to say cautiously, people CAN change! If they know they're wrong and take the responsibility. Respect is earned. Love is trust. We cannot violate trust or we violate love.

I‚Äôm sure he meant it as a joke not thinking she‚Äôd actually do it, but she hit me so hard I was bleeding. I told the school administrators who did nothing and I told my parents who did nothing and she completely got away with it. She knew she‚Äôd get away with it and that‚Äôs why she did it. My point is that there is a massive double standard when it comes to women assaulting men, and women can and do get away with it. If I had done to her what she did to me, I‚Äôd have gotten expelled and probably ended up in jail (and rightfully so). While my heart goes out to women who have been victims of domestic abuse, I also feel for the men being abused as well and I think we, as a society, should stop it with the double standard and look at all abuse as wrong.",1,2022-04-27T18:05:50Z,2022-04-27T18:05:50Z

@Á•ûÂ•àÂ∑ù„Çà„Åó„Çç„ÅÜ,"@Ben Shapiro

Thank you for your logical analysis  and helping expose sociopathic abuse. 

Your take on it is actually helping people understand the many different forms of gaslighting that may have been done to them. The ironic thing is, I have had parents like Johnny's in my life as well. I'm 32 now. By 23, I successfuly utilized Tibetan forms of single pointed (calming) and alytical(insight)meditation in order to healthily remove my mind's emotional attachments to past experiences/manipulation that created unconscious blindspots,


The benefit of this mental refinement tool is to remove subconscious or unconscious influence which would other wise create ill-timed/ out of touch perception of reality and ultimately actions...

Thought, emotions, feelings could influence how we feel when looking at the past however,
since a meditative state is utilized, we can safely remain absent from emotional overload. To observe it from a 3rd person, more mature(aware and registering reality) perspective

A meditative State is controlled state of separation from emotional influence so to presence things rather than react to emotions that are generated subconsciously based on ""perception"" ,rather than clear awareness of internal/external  realities as to whether we are or are not getting what we need in life... 

People have emotions yet those who believe emotions are reflection of reality remain blind externally and accumulate more suffering that could develop new blindspots from mental overload.


 

minds biased tendency to feel need to keep busy is severed due to separation from emotions via letting go, rather than unhealthily repressing, which would normally 



I removed the minds biases to love people who used me, however it's really scary how some people can be gas-lit for so long by somebody of this nature.

To a Person to is not Lovestruck and is viewing the court case absent from Johnny Depps emotional biases which keeps Heards manipulation in control, we remain less susceptible. Sociopathic people follow the victims blind spots reflected by actions, such as in this case, unconditional love for a similar frequency as Johnny's mother, as Johnny has resorted to drugs just pushing the trauma deeper to the point the mind could fall into the pattern of finding silence in the momentary switch from old pain to new pain after we experienced trauma threshold. Amber Heard was choosen in unconscious ways surrounding the unconditional devotion/love Johnny had for his mother who made him feel he had to fix himself in order to be loved by anyone.

Johnny's mother did this to him due to Sociopathy induced by trauma creating the illusion by hurting sensitive Johnny she would feel less alone as she ran from her past.

So as you said Ben....he's not the monster.

Thank you Ben.


I wish you peacefulness, ultimately promoting internal silence and mental clarity to defending and exploring reality.


Woke= cases of trauma creating Sociopaths and  narcissists on left and right..people afraid to acknowledge what's in the world around them or their internal existence due to unhealed trauma limiting mental energy to acknowledge /awareness to what is different, safely/without being spread to thin, ultimately becoming vulnerable. 

Mental energy is needed to ensure  our awareness that Sociopaths can exist everywhere, does not turn to reality as our aim to acknowledge and cherish all of life's existence is carried out.

I will cherish  incompatible life and understand I can't control It, and limiting our interactions so I can remain able to cherish and respect it, unemotionally and unimpulsively if am accident happens.

Do you even know why? Figure it out, doesn‚Äôt take a 25 year very very strong intuitive empath to figure this out, what I can say is I have looked through her eyes and was really easy to find the soul intentions of this man and it is to ruin every aspect, and form of this man! She is empty inside her aura is cold and dark and the color that surrounds her even eventually scared me, and I have seen way to much to be surprised anymore, well I was wrong, she is dark very dark, my advise to Mr Depp, when this is over get all your assets you have sell all, take what‚Äôs left and get as far away from this women as u can!

2.  His career has not ended; he is a proven commodity and will regain his stature and be  ""bankable. ""
3.  Passive or no response to allegations of physical abuse is not a direct admission of guilt.  
4.   Heard has claimed Johnny hit her but he has not admitted to that or made an inference to the subject of hitting her.  
5.  Amber admits she slugged him.  It's on tape- it's a physical admission of a charge of simple battery.  
6.  Depp's evidence of defamation is Heard's newspaper piece that all but calls him a scumbag.  
7.   Depp is going for the throat- Heard can't pay if she loses a $50 million suit.  She can't settle for a lesser amount because she doesn't have enough money.  
8.  Her $100 million suit is her lawyer throwing mud back at Depp's attorney.  It won't hold up.

God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

@irinaeu467,"NONE of them should have lost their jobs, credibility or respect because of this. None on them is a victim and BOTH of them are victims of themselves and of each other. I'll explain. His subconscient is setted on liking  strong willed wemen ( like his mom) and running away from life's problems ( like his dad). That's the examples that he had growing up and that's what's deeply rooted into his subconscient. Yes, it's sad. Even sadder is that this type of people LOOK  FOR and PROVOKE the victimisation situations. They are passive-agresive pushing your buttons until you are exasperated and snap at them so they can complain about you snapping and feel like victims. This is how they feel ""at home"". They unconsciously feel attracted to ppl that they can push to that point of snapping. He needs a good therapist that treats him like a pacient, NOT like a client. The difference is that a pacient you want to cure, a client you want to keep coming, just give the illusion of ""it's working"". Her, on the other side... it seems that she still believes in Disney s old princess  fairytales  where love concurs all or has the ""Mother Theresa syndrome"" ( thinks that she can save everyone).It doesn't and she can't. This is real life. You can't save someone that doesn't really want to be saved. She seems to be a strong willed woman that likes to talk about the problems that life brings and solve them together, like any responsible adult should. All relationships have arguements. They help understand eachother. On the other hand, when she was trying to talk to him about anything that might have bothered her, he was running away. That's childish. You can hear the exasperation in her voice in some talks they had. So she wants to talk to him and help him, he DOESN'T know how to react but run away so she snaps...aloooot, worse every time because it becomes more and more frustrating. She loves him, means well but she's not a therapist to help him. He must love her otherwise wouldn't have married her, but, unfortunately, he never learned how to handle relationship problems, just to run from them. From there  comes the chaos. He gets more cold and she gets more mad, looking like a crazy b-ch for the outside people. Love becomes resentment. They both feel abused and they are both right from their point of view.  They just don't mix. He will never have a healthy relationship with any woman as long as he doesn't get rid of that abusive patterns that are deep inside of him and make him click. She needs to understand she can't save everyone and not let (out of love) this type of relationship lead to the point where she gets all crazy. NO person  gets so ""crazy"" without a trigger, unless they have a diagnosed medical condition. None of them  has this. They are both a little broken. We ALL are in some ways.

@selahr.,"As a marriage counselor you‚Äôre wrong‚Ä¶ it is possible to have one person who does all the abuse especially when the other partner experienced childhood abuse which made them learn to become passive or avoidant of abusive or angry people. Depp has that childhood history, and AH‚Äôs complaints that he is hurting her or making her become unstable because he‚Äôs walking away during verbal fights is the typical pattern we see in female domestic violence perpetrators.  They want to be allowed endless amounts of time to barrage their partner and do not want to ‚Äúend the fight‚Äù until they get what they want.  Research from John Gottman has shown that men become physiologically overwhelmed in marital fights on average in about fifteen minutes, after which they will try to leave physically or mentally to psychologically protect themselves and to try to not become aggressive (the fight or flight response). Depp‚Äôs pattern was to become quiet and passive and hope it would blow over, which made her more upset because she wasn‚Äôt getting the resolution or engagement that she wanted, so she would ramp up until he reached the point he has to flea. She would follow him and continue the fight. I‚Äôm marriage counseling I call this ‚Äúchasing the fight‚Äù because these women believe the fight has to keep going so it can end the way they want so they‚Äôll feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù again‚Ä¶ because the unresolved fight feels unsafe and their partner pulling away from them feels unsafe too. This case couldn‚Äôt be more typical or ‚Äútextbook‚Äù. The only atypical thing here is this became a public circus because of their status and because she attacked his character in such a public way.  Their whole relationship and the pattern of abuse, and AH‚Äôs dating history (intense infatuation, rapid seriousness/commitment, short duration, quickly finding a new partner) is also very typical of women with Borderline Personality Disorder and/or Histrionic Personality Disorder, and the forensic psychologist diagnosed her with both on the stand.",0,2022-04-27T16:34:34Z,2022-04-27T16:34:34Z

@liza.1888,"For the most part of the time I agree with you Ben but this time I can‚Äôt because there are tapes, recordings and text messages showing JD did in fact have a drug and alcohol abuse and his career was declining WAY BEFORE Amber said anything! 

1. If someone text you what JD did, NO ONE wouldn‚Äôt take that as a joke because he wasn‚Äôt joking especially if he starts going on a rage and breaks things. If he goes on ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù thats even worse! 

2. On the recordings and tapes Johnny admits to physically hitting Amber on different occasions. And Amber‚Äôs hand will never physically match JD strength specially under the influence of substance!  

3. The Dr. Cowell testimony and deposition was in fact in fear for Amber‚Äôs safety. That‚Äôs why there was a DV.

4. Lastly, this case is about defamation on Domestic Violence aka ‚ÄúDV‚Äù which means it comes in DIFFERENT FORMS like physical, verbal, mental, psychological, sexual, emotional and even spiritual and Amber was most definitely a victim of one of them so there‚Äôs NO DEFAMATION! 

I do believe there are men out there who are abuse and nothing gets done for them but when JD openly admits to childhood abuse, drugs substance and alcohol abuse while being the aggressor, he can‚Äôt sit there and claim victim when he wasn‚Äôt!

@jonbell1193,"Was with a physically abusive woman for a short period of time in the 90's. She cold-cocked me once in the bread basket cuz she didn't like how I put a mayonnaise jar lid on. Couple days later was at work and my manager noticed the black and blue bruise on my gut while I buttoned my company shirt up before my shift. My manager was a woman. I told her the truth.
I didn't know that she did a slow burn over the incident until cops showed up at my workplace wanting to talk to me. She called the cops.
They asked me to lift my shirt and tell them wow I got the bruise, so I did.
Here's where you'll see the gender bias when it comes to domestic violence.
One cop told me that because it's been a couple of days and that I didn't make a complaint there was nothing they could do.
The other cop said, quote: We expect a man to be able to defend himself. Then they left.
Had I defended myself, I'd have gone to jail and we all know it.
Aside from the Hollywood BS theatrics getting played out in the case of Depp where millions of dollars are being grabbed at, the only positive thing coming out of this reality show drama is the fact that YES, some females are psycho violent offenders who get off on punching people who cannot punch back without risking going to jail just for defending themselves. And that's not taking into account how mentally abusive some women are, just ask Will Smith.

@shanehixson1313,"Ben is actually quite wrong about abuse rarely being one sided. Mutual abuse is in fact very very rare. Abusive relationships are almost always composed of a control freak and a doormat. The control freak is an insure abuser who uses pain and fear of pain to control the other person. They do this because they believe the pain inside themselves is actually coming from their partner when in fact is coming from within (external locus of control). Thus they believe that controlling the behavior of the other party will stop their pain or be a source of happiness. On the other side,  a doormat is an insecure enabler who does everything in their power to please the other party because in there mind the thought of being alone of more terrifying than being abused. They usually always believe if they can behave well enough, the abuser will eventually be satisfied and change.",1,2022-04-27T16:21:17Z,2022-04-27T16:21:17Z

@skylerturden1820,"Uh, knowing that you're a lawyer I thought you'd have a better take on this.

The trial is not for abuse nor an appeal to the divorce terms or the restraining order, it's for defamation for Heard's 2018 article. In it she says ""two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse"" referencing to the 2016 divorce but she never mentioned Depp directly nor described details of their relationship.

What Depp's lawyers need to do is prove to the court that his reputation was damaged by the words of the article itself, but they can't do it. His reputation was damaged already by the divorce itself and by the media's reaction to it. In fact it was a previous article by The Sun which infamously called him a ""wife beater"" so if anything that one was the most defaming.

If this trial manages to clear Depp's name good for him, but it wasn't tainted by the 2018 article in the first place, so Heard is innocent of the crime she's been accused of.",1,2022-04-27T16:15:03Z,2022-04-27T16:15:03Z

She clearly as his friends who arrived there at his place first, caught Amber and her buddies, fake a run in to save her from being hit....when nothing was happening. It was all clearly as set up to make money and mooch off of Amber by framing Depp, and when the mooching buddy of Amber H  ran into Deeps Home shouting fake ""Stop hurting and hitting Amber"" , however Depp's buddies were watching it all, in the house saw the whole fake victimhood abuse, fake-attack and fake- hero fabricated lieing nonesense by Amber's goons and her a complete sham set up to stage something that never happened.
