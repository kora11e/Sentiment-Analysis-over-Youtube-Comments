@zxy78267,"Well CNN, I am disgusted with your biased coverage. As a woman who suffered true abuse, it was very clear that amber was lying. She threatened to ruin Johnny, and with the help of her attorney and her freeloading friends, she tried exactly that when he didn't cave to her demands. The vast majority of the population who watched the trial saw her lies for what they were. So did the jury, behavior and body language experts across the board, and many, many women, and men, who have experienced what she described, and plainly do not believe her. She even stole her assistant's s. assault story!

AMBER WAS A PROVEN LIAR. She's on tape admitting she abused Depp, Amber was arrested for DV. THIS IS TOTAL BULL$HIT.

Why are all the MSM outlets supporting the liar and abuser? It can't get any clearer than this, so they are basically saying men can't be victims. That's complete bull$hit.

@kevock7100,"Know wonder CNN is going down the drain a Jury found Heard was at fault both teams had lawyers the case was presented the jurors found in Favour of Depp, apparently Heard is comparable to other big time Hollywood actors.

But because CNN doesn’t like the decision the bring on two people to start with ohh he is a big actor, she’s not comparable to him when a witness said she was, never mind the evidence where she craps on the bed, seriously taking movies of an older bloke coming home late from work and setting him up for failure, and really trying to make her look the victim. 

Woman hate to thing they are not the victim but actually the aggressor and all men are at fault SERIOUSLY, women are subtle in their emotional blackmail, they will start an engagement of abuse towards their husbands but men are louder and when they have enough who do you think people hear the louder man.

No wonder CNN is going down the drain when they are appealing to toxic feminism and bring on a feminist male and a toxic female for their opinions, when they don’t report both sides of the story with facts but instead report the story with Bias, well done CNN you have done it again.

How about once just once report a story with facts not bias and let the viewer make their assumptions because they are allegedly grown ups, but anyone who watches CNN I shouldn’t make that assumption now should I.",1,2022-06-27T19:52:34Z,2022-06-27T19:52:34Z

@fictionjunkie,"Jake Tapper I'm disappointed in this coverage, I'm disappointed in the narrative it's adopting trying to make this about the ""greater ramifications"" this trial was about this case specifically not a movement. I found your guest Areva Martin somewhat disingenuous far more concerned about the implications on causes then this specific case and when she had to bring up statistics instead of evidence and truths specific to this case it makes me feel that she doubts Amber Heard's credibility. Yes false allegations are rare but Amber Heard's own testimony is enough to make any reasonable person doubt her.  The MeToo movement is overall a good thing but it has flaws and in this case it has been exploited, own it, be better, move forward but ignoring inconvenient truths and insulating bad faith actors rather than dealing with systemic flaws would be countering the entire point of the movement.",1,2022-06-23T05:39:51Z,2022-06-23T05:39:51Z

She says: Less than 10% of women lie about being sexually abused. That's why the jury can't deny practically all of Heard's claims. 

That doesn't mean that 90% of the allegations of a specific case needs to be found true.
Because this is about an average of cases you can't apply this to separate claims. 
If this is one of the 10% cases in which a woman lies, it doesn't mean that only 10% of her claims are valid. Then ALL of her claims are unvalid. The separate claims don't follow the 90/10 divide of the average case. And absurd to think that whenever someone's lying, they are speaking 10% truth.",0,2022-06-20T14:22:32Z,2022-06-20T14:23:03Z

AH had a chance to speak and prove her claims, but she didn't. Her testimonies and her witnesses' were inconsistent +, and much of JD's proofs were dismissed by the judge on the UK trial, including the police reports. 
Some of his evidence was also dismissed in Virginia. 

Stop presenting this as if JD was favoured and AH demonised. She did this to herself. 

This isn't about a victim who wasn't believed. It's about a liar who was exposed. Everyone believed AH until she was exposed; funnily enough, no one gave a platform to Johnny to tell his side of the story back then. 

And now we are talking about biases. 

Amber Heard is THE SETBACK for women and all survivors!

when i finally found the courage to break up with him, he did exactly what ab*sers do to those who escape: defame them until they're reduced to dirt. and that's exactly what my ex did. my reputation went down the toilet in a matter of days and i had to drop out of school. i still remember telling my mom that if she forced me out of the car, i'd jump into traffic. i wasn't lying. i spent years hiding from the outside world.

@nnct5669,"Sad to see i was a supporter of cnn. This goes to show they did not watch the trial & a shame that they try to push this as Amber being a victim. She was the abuser. No mountains of evidence like they keep repeating. She used fake edited photos! How was the jury suposed to believe. Theres audio proof of hours with the full context & you can see she is evil & at a point Johnny replies but never with violence. What was shown in court is only a piece of the evidence that can prove all her lies. She cut & admits to it in an audio that did not make it. Her team push out a lot of serious evidence thqt would prove how horrible she truly is. Maybe it was toxic, but the only abuser was her! The only one with real proof is Johnny. Her lies started with her knowing divorce was coming & she wanted to make sure Johnny would give her what she asked for. She blackmailed him so he would give her penthouses for her & her friends, car, monthly payments, pay her expenses & more things or she would file a TRO against Johnny. Even when she knew he would be out of the country, he was promoting a movie, his mom died & it was his daughters bday. There is an audio where she admits to getting it because her lawyers told her to so she wouldnt be kicked out of her penthouse even though Johnny told her she could stay for a few months till they figure things out. She was very confortable to take men into Johnnys house in the middle of the night when Johnny was working. She did that countless times, having treesomes & she had the audacity to say Johnny would get jealous. He started struggling with his career, drugs & money because of amber. I believe if he would have stayed with her he wouldnt be alive.",0,2022-06-15T01:46:11Z,2022-06-15T01:46:11Z

@robertagarza4325,"To all those Amber Heard supporters, what if it was your son who came to you that they're being abused by their wife or girlfriend? So what you're saying is all women are right even if they're caught lying  and all men are abusers, so your pretty much saying you're not going to believe your son. I have three sons and I have always shown them to not raise their hands on a women but now this trial makes you think, what if they're put in a position that they need to protect themselves from their partner, so they are expected to just deal with being abused because society believes that all women are telling the truth. Johnny Depp has opened so many doors for men to come forward with their stories and struggles of abuse that many of them have dealt with because they are scared people just wouldn't believe their story . I believe the world has seen that a women can also be the abuser, domestic violence has no specific gender and it never has been, and it never will be in the future. Amber Heard was so sure that she was going to win because like she said, ""tell the world Johnny who's going to believe you"". Many woman have played a role in situations just like this and everyone needs to open their eyes to that fact. There are hundreds of stories of men losing everything just because of simply being accused of acts like this while not getting the chance to say their side of the story. Do not get me wrong men can be abusers but never forget the fact women can be too.",0,2022-06-10T01:57:28Z,2022-06-10T01:57:28Z

@hermitlifeinthemountainsub9493,"This is FAR from a setback to women's rights. The first amendment does not protect libel, slander, and defamation. The UK trial was Depp vs. The Sun, and Elaine lies about the ""suppressed evidence"" which was not allowed in because it was hearsay. Elaine had her 15 minutes of fame, but she once again set upon defaming Johnny Depp, and I hope she gets sued and disbarred.  She has to be the worst attorney I have ever seen. The #MeToo movement is a ridiculous movement that gives a female gender to domestic and sexual violence. It is horrific in that people who lie, like Amber Heard, take this and use it for their criminal needs. In Amber's case, it was to extort her ex-husband of millions of dollars. Then she committed another crime by pledging money while not donating it. Amber needs to be made an example of. She deserves to be brought up on extortion, fraud and perjury. She should also be arrested for level 1 assault and get a strike for amputating Johnny Depp's finger while in a psychotic rage. She should also be hospitalized in a mental hospital and not be released until she is properly medicated, and have life long supervision. Her child needs to be in the custody of a family member who is not mentally ill or have violent crimes. The life that is saved could be Oonaugh's. She is in grave danger. Amber hijacked the #MeToo movement.  Her criminal actions have exposed this movement for the hipocracy it represents. #MeToo sends the wrong message, a message that states DV or SV can only have a female for a victim. Making an example of Amber, a violent, mentally ill extortionist sends the RIGHT message! #AmberHeard, #EveBarlow, #JohnnyDepp #ElaineBredehoft",1,2022-06-09T06:12:28Z,2022-06-09T06:12:28Z

Amber Heard, Jody Arias, Casey Anthony, Shayna Hubers are a text book example of narcissism and sociopaths.  They are so evil and disgusting!!  I don't believe prison would be good enough for these monsters!  I think they need to be executed.  We don't need people like this in this society and it is a societal tragedy that they try to hide behind true victims of domestic violence!   I am so happy that Johnny Depp won this trial.  It's about time we get some justice in this country.  However, I think he should of got more than 15 million, he should of at least got 50 million plus.  If  Amber decides to appeal this case, I guarantee Johnny will win again and she will pay more money to him and more people will come forward in support of him and they and Johnny Depp's attorneys will also get a nice hearty sum of money and Amber Heard will end up rotting in jail for life for perjury and libel!  And that is her personal tragedy that she has created. I pray that Kate James will also sue Amber Heard because she too was a victim of her,",3,2022-06-07T22:50:56Z,2022-06-07T22:50:56Z

@jwalk31,"Who are you!!!!  What college did you graduate from?  Remind me never to send my daughter there because you are either an idiot, or you are shilling for ""powerful"" people on Amber's side.  Did you even look at the trial.  

She lied about the bruise on her face
She lied about the fight in Australia
She lied about the TMZ leak
She lied about the broken nose
She lied about editing the TMZ video
She lied about hitting him
She lied about the danger of being pushed down the stairs
Are you getting the idea?   PLUS

There is audio of her admitting she hit HIM
There is audio of him saying he was getting away from her
There is audio of her daring him to say he is a victim of domestic abuse, because no one will believe him


And your assessment of the UK trial is absurd by all accounts.  You don't even understand how different it is there.  Plus it was a corrupt judge who ruled in favor of Amber, also documented.  you are letting your womaness decide for your brain, that's disappointing. You can't even allow yourself to think that a man can be abused by a woman, and this is why you and Amber keep saying ""women"" are set back.  What about ABUSERS period.  You can't include men in that? This case opend a lot of eyes and you are on the wrong side. Let facts tell the story of abuse, not feelings, not believabilty based on gender.... facts.

@gothicm3rcy426,"This is CNN showing how sexist they are against men.... a man that went through 7 years of unproven accusations you deem as ""a powerful man""?. Instead of admitting a mistake and apologising? 
For years, due to the media, people believed Amber Heard until this trial, when it became obvious to ANYONE with a modocum of intelligence that Amber Heard told lie after lie.... this isnt even debateable... her lawyer was terrible also and didnt even do her research on the doctors testomony, but worse.... didnt even know Amber Heards maeup she stated she used... didnt even go on sale until 2017.
Amber Heard and her terrible lawyer are a laughing stock.
The woke media is trying its best to spin it and carry on with their hatred of men.... but the trial was televised.... we can all just watch it again..... and basically accusing the jury of cheating ""how could they posibly not be influeced by social media"", 
Also women definately did score a victory here.... camille vasyez was amazing, the judge was very professional.... and MANY women, including abuse victims, can see through  the lies from Amber Heard.... Women and men have come together in agreement Amber Heard is malicious and vindictive.
Im a victime of abuse, and yes Im a man.... i ended up in psychiatric hospital because of it.
The UK where I lived at the time, is still extremely biased to abuse and its VERY rare to see any sympathy for a man.... In fact during a custody case for my daughter... my ex wifes (the abuser, mentally and physicall) lawyer actually said ""we are supposed to believe a woman can actually abuse a man""... and smirked.... this comment was allowed in court... people in the courtroom actually ""chuckled"" when it was stated.
The case was the last straw for me and its why I ended up in a psych ward from a complete breakdown and attempted suicide.
Shame on CNN..... another woke media deliberately looking at everything that fits their political agenda..... theyre not interested in facts or justice.
No medical records with injuries even though heard claimed slashed arms and feet, plus a broken nose. Police at scenes saw no bruises or marks on amber heard.... in fact the only time she had ""bruises""... ""without makeup"" just happened to be on the same day the paparrazi showed up, every other time heard claimed ""Im outside so Im wearing makeup to cover bruises"".

@barbaraellenseidel9100,"yes, it has nothing to do with his being a powerful man.   It is about a woman who was caught in her lies and ruining someone's life.   She was found to be liar on too many instances.   She lied about paying out money to the charities.  The police found no apartment wrecked like she claimed.  She also cheated on him and used him for his money and even got Elon Musk to pay out 500k here and 250k there and another 250k on her behalf.  She used Elon Musk.  She filed a restraining order when Johnny was out of the country and no where near her because of divorce papers.   And she allowed her friends to live off of Depp while she was being abused?   This is nuts.    They had no problems living in his penthouses for free while he was supposed beating the shit out of her?   This is totally nuts.    The police found no domestic violence.   The cameras from the police showed no damage and it seems that she staged her bruises with her ""bruise kit""?   and she lied about TMZ when she clearly wanted to defame him.    Clearly, She was recklessly lying.  She is a con artist, gold digger, and deserves what she got.   This is not blaming the victim.   Then on top of that, Amber Heard's team leading and not likable.   They sounded like used car salesmen.   Elaine continues to go around twisting the facts and using the UK case which did not have Amber Heard in the case except as a lying witness for the gossip Daily Mail Newspaper.    Of course, Violence in relationships should never be supported but neither should liars setting up their spouses whoever they are.   men or women.   Sorry but as a woman, no bruises, no medical reports, and exaggerated lies is why she lost... furthermore, no one likes a con artist, liar, or twisted spouse, gold digger. She even tried to use his Kate Moss as if he pushed her down the stairs too which Kate Moss testified that it was quite the opposite.   There is no reality of fact in her claims and this is why she lost.  Women who have real issues with men are the ones who are harmed from this because a pathological liar is why she did not win the case.   Her expert witnesses were also thrown under the bus because they had holes in their story.   No one likes a liar, con artist, gold digger, and this is why she lost.   It has nothing to do with a powerful man who clearly has serious drug /alcohol issues and does not need her hell in his life either.   And it seems that she may also be a drug addict/alcoholic too?   not sure but the rest of the statements by her were proven to be false.",0,2022-06-07T02:03:21Z,2022-06-07T02:21:06Z

@fires2398,"I'm actually glad it was aired and became a public spectacle. It lets people see for themselves how they testified and allows people to come to their own decision regarding who to support, rather than have it behind closed doors and speculate. In fact, some of these smear campaigns by Amber Heard post trial may have actually worked if it was behind closed doors and people did not have first hand accounts regarding the evidence that was put forth or lack of to call her out on her bs. The very purpose of this trial was to clear Johnny's name and reveal to the world what actually happened. Context is very important (how they testify, demeanor, quality of evidence put forth, etc.) and had I heard Amber had a mega pint of evidence I may have believed her somewhat. However, how she testified, the constant back peddling and the evidence itself failed under scrutiny to substantiate her claims. I don't have any fear of how this will affect society. The only people it will affect and dissuade are those liars looking for a free ride. A true mockery of the feminist social movement by trying to use that as a cover for ones misdeeds. While it's true not all women lie, not all women tell the truth as well. Amber heard credibility took a nose dive during the trial itself and was busted for it a number of times throughout said trial whether it be testimonies from kate moss, the dc president, police, etc. I would say justice was served. Amber would rather have you believe everyone lying but her. To believe that reaches conspiracy levels of lunacy.",1,2022-06-06T23:27:45Z,2022-06-06T23:27:45Z

@CapricornPrime,"Everyone is entitled to a presumption of innocence. Amber Heard had her day in court and failed terribly (e.g., her many, many lies caught up with her - doctored pictures, no witnesses backing up her stories, gross embellishments of her stories, making up stuff which never happened (Kate Moss being pushed down stairs by Johnny Depp), saying she donated to children's hospitals, and literally crapping on the bed! I could go on.) For 6 years, Johnny Depp had to live with the stigma of being a ""wifebeater."" 

Choosing who to believe based on gender is ridiculous. Did this analyst even bother to watch the trial before opening her mouth? It weakens her credibility on future comments she may have on anything.

As a thought experiment. Suppose there are two people in a relationship and there is an allegation of DV. We should believe the woman based on gender, right?! What if they are both women? What if they're both men? What happened to finding the truth? Everyone's claim should be taken seriously and investigated but no one should have their lives destroyed without proper investigation.",9,2022-06-06T17:21:22Z,2022-06-06T17:21:22Z

@awosikaoluwatobi1266,"Reading comments is more my style but I have to drop my two cents.
This case generally to me is about two individuals who lived their lives in private and showed the public what we beg to see love and perfection.
They both hurt each other in the relationship but one got hurt more than the order. 
I don't think anyone with a sound mind will believe AH's story. Yes, we are believers in the ""metoo"" movement but that doesn't mean when you see a snake you should call it a fish let's call a snake a snake. The board of metoo should also look into this thoroughly.
The man was punished by the world and she was rewarded for what she had to go through. When he finally comes out to give his side of the story with a lot of evidence even voice recording of the lady who has lied to everyone for years we are to look the order way. The lady who lied about donations.
Let's leave J.D's case for a while with all the nonsense justice and all she lied to the world that she donated all the money from her divorce to charity with that alone if I am on the jury she has lost my trust.
That donation would have gone a long way to touching people's lives mostly the children to me. 
What exactly happened to the donations no one is asking her.
Amber should please not distract us with the DV and how it is a setback for women she is the setback for women and this also proves that every gender can be victims.
She need to check into a psychiatric hospital to get properly diagnosed and adequate treatment, if not for herself then anyone she loves.Her behaviour was not normal with the smirking and all.

As for the metoo and all, everyone no matter the gender should be allowed to speak on their truth no one should be restricted. This is an eye-opener that anyone and everyone can be victims sometimes without even knowing.

Just like ""ACLU"" & THE CHILDREN HOSPITAL"" 

One of the her celeb friends should visit her and ask her what is the next step like "" should we start a gofundme let just pay the bill so you can move on and my dear friend I love you but you screwed up big time with your acting, smirking (you would have been very good as maleficent) and what was with the writing were you trying to score the clerks job""",0,2022-06-06T08:22:20Z,2022-06-06T08:22:20Z

I'm gonna stop you there, that's in the past that women are mostly the ones who get abused. But here we are now, 2022, ffs it's modern times now. Anyone can be abused, at any gender, at any age, and we should normalize that, that anyone shouldn't be abused, not only women.
Johnny Depp doesn't even care about winning, he wanted to show the whole world that he *really* was abused, that *men* can also be abused in a relationship, that *women* can also be the abuser in a relationship.
She had shown mountain of evidences-
Evidences of what? They're all lies, they are even made up with the help of her own sister.

@marquitamarina1486,"Areva is shamelessly showing her bias and ignorance. The FACTS and EVIDENCE prove that not only was Amber lying, she was the abuser. She did not provide one shred of credible evidence to prove her accusations. None. Accusations are not proof. Elaine and Areva are LYING (that's right, Areva. I'm calling you a LIAR.)  about the UK case and having evidence from that case that was not allowed in court when, in fact, it was JD who was not allowed to present evidence in the UK case. (Amber was NOT a party to the UK case. She was only a witness. She also headlined a fund raiser dinner for the judge's wife. You really should at least make an attempt at research before you go on national TV and shame yourself, Areva.) Depp also had evidence that was not allowed in court such as the audio recording that Amber herself secretly recorded in the immediate chaotic aftermath of her severing Johnny's finger in Australia where she admits to throwing the bottle and cutting off his finger, profusely apologizing and saying she did not mean to hurt him and confessing to Jerry Judge that she was under the influence of hallucinogens, cocaine, mushrooms, Adderal and Xanax when she did it and also confessed to being the one who caused all the property damage. (If anybody is interested in hearing that recording you can find it on the youtube channel ""Incredibly Average."")
Depp was also not allowed to bring in her criminal record. Amber is as much an alcoholic and drug addict as she claims JD to be. And she was the one cheating in the marriage, the one bringing men to spend the night with her in JD's penthouse while he was away working 14 hour days to pay for her $1000 per day wine addiction and provide free housing for her freeloading friends and family.
IMO Areva is a misandrist and for all we know could also be an abuser. Nothing she says is credible.
There was no proof provided at trial that proves JD ever assaulted or abused Amber Turd. The Me, Too organization dropped Amber like a hot potato years ago after hearing her abuse JD on the audio recordings. The Times Up Legal Defense Fund also provided Amber with four attorneys at the beginning of the trial but every single one of them withdrew after the audio tapes of Amber abusing Johnny went public. 
Amber is a criminal. She has a history of defamation, domestic abuse, fraud, perjury and it is said that she killed one of her friends when a teenager when she was drunk driving and wrecked her father's $60K vehicle and lost her license for four years and was ordered to perform community services. Amber is sadistic, vengeful and just plain evil. She needs to go away and finally leave Johnny alone now. I loathe Amber for insulting REAL domestic violence survivors. And I loathe Areva for her self righteous bias and willful ignorance.

@Pochex,"It was a win for a victim of DV. If the victim has money, status, and is a guy that's something that shouldn't affect the verdict. The only thing that's  importsnt it's the evidence. JD brought evidence and Amber changed her story and did things that doesn't make sense that DV victims don't do. JD could've been a low profile actor, and would've won anyways. Because facts and evidence matters. The only person in power here was Amber. Amber made up stories and waste the court's time with very poor evidence. Experts in body languaje that have trained the fbi and cia even analyzed her body language. Experienced lawyers analyzed her past and present arguments, and she was found she was not being honest or accurate towards behaving accordingly to the trauma of real DV victims. They  actually show a different reaction in these kind of circumstances during a trial. Amber herself was in power and she used that power. The fact itself of her gender gave her vantage in a more powerful level than Jhonny's. She knew that. She maliciously used the me too movement to harm him. And yes, JD has money, fame, and popularity but that doesn't mean he can't be a victim as well of DV.  Of course he can be, and he was. And even after divorce and the op ed she continued bullying him socially using the media and her only talent: creating false allegations about an innocent person to gain popularity at the expenses of emotional damage by the diffamation afflicted to her victim. Just for fame, money, and more status in Hollywood. She is a monster. A narcissist, and every single psychologist I watch analyzing her said the same.  Even normal regular people could see that. Experts have talked. The jury did their job. Justice was setved. They honored the truth and served justice. The system worked, but UK has a different system. Several witnesses and evidence were not presented in UK. Jhonny's lawyers made sure to include them this time. The verdict in UK is on the hands of one person, the judge. And he was linked to ucla. The judge was biased. That's why he lost in UK and won here. Almost 99% of the comments everywhere support Jhonny. Even DV victims. I don't understand what kind of logic Martin is using here.

I see hit piece after hit piece in the mainstream media attacking the verdict and JD. How convenient that they ignore witness testimonies, photo and audio evidence that go against AH claims. All they care about is how their movement is affected and they do not care about the implications of their generalizations. Sometimes evidence is hard in abuse cases, especially when it happens sporadically and when victims are unable to document their abuse. But in this case, AH was very adept in taking pictures, videos and audio recordings of lots of things, yet failed to document the very brutal abuse she testified to. Instead we got evidence that opened the door to the opposite of what AH was claiming. Sometimes I feel like I cannot trust the world anymore.

She had all the opportunity to present the evidence in THIS trial to prove her claims, and ultimately by unanimous decision her evidence was rejected. It was quite obvious to the world and the jury that she was lying. Her evidence simply wasn't credible. Its quality, not quantity. She had 0 medical records to prove her statements, claimed everyone was lying but her and had to walk back countless statement like the lie regarding kate moss being pushed down the stairs and what was revealed by the DC president that canned her butt not because of depp, but because of bad chemistry/poor acting.

@elisatseng6286,"CNN this is astonishing bad and biased. You clearly did not watch the trial because you did you'd know that Amber Heard told lies after lies. If Heard had won - it'd be a setback for women. Men lie, women lie. It's incredibly biased and discrimnatory to think that men cannot be a domestic violence victim. #metoo should represent women and men and trans and whoever. JD went into this case knowing that it was difficult to prove defamation given that he's a public figure. He didn't do it for the money, he did it to restore his reputation - sadly it will never be quite the same for JD. The seed of doubt was already sown. It has been carefully laid out and demonstrated that Heard tipped off TMZ re the ktichen cabinet incident, she orchestrated the this TRO/divorce order to have paparazzi waiting for her to capture her alleged bruises on the right side of her face, she virtue singalled and claimed that she had donated all $7 million from her divorce settlement - she lied (oh that's right she uses pledged and donated interchangeably), Don't buy it",0,2022-06-05T06:57:50Z,2022-06-05T06:57:50Z

@StreakyBaconMan,"The whole idea that Heard got such negative attention just because she is a woman is just ridiculous. She got the negative attention because she was caught lying about a very serious crime. I seem to remember a few years back a man orchestrated a racial attack hoax for the media, and he was also mocked relentlessly online and by many celebrities and comedians. People who get caught lying about such serious things tend to be widely hated, because most people want to do the right thing and be against racist or sexist people and support victims of racist and sexist attacks and don't appreciate their desire to do the right thing being abused by a liar for their own personal gain. The reason I felt so passionately about this case was solely because at first I believed Depp was abusive based on her claims and I held that belief for years - I had no reason to not believe her at the time. To find out later that I was in fact duped and that the evidence shows Heard actually abused Depp and then falsely accused him after a failed blackmail attempt to try and get a favorable divorce settlement really pissed me off and made me feel invested in the outcome of this trial - I wanted Heard to pay, not only for what she did to Depp but also for duping me into believing her for all that time.",0,2022-06-05T01:14:25Z,2022-06-05T01:14:25Z

@geraltofriffia210,"This is a very disappointing take on the Depp vs Heard trial. I've always been good to the women in my life. Some are amongst my best friends and they, aswel as my male friends, are the thing I cherish most in this world.

I've felt misunderstood my entire life outside of that group though. The world I see is one of hatred towards men. When they work hard and make a lot of money they are monsters. When they dont work hard and dont make any money they are useless. Their suicide rates are off the charts and still, the FAST MAJORITY of them, have been nothing but considerate towards female victims of domestic violence they encounter in their lives, while having their own run ins with abuse from the opposite gender.

We have experienced the fact that man can be abused. We dont want your pity, but would really appreciate it if you gave us the same courtesy as we most of us give you. You've seen far more evidence of Depp's injuries, and Ambers verbal and physical abuse, then you've seen of the reverse. I've watched the entire trial and have researched the topic online extensively and I'm heart broken that people still defend her actions. We've heard Heard mock johnny depp, admit to violence on audio, heard he change her testimony from the UK trial, heard her outrageous claims about Kate moss be proven false. Christ. There is even video online of Ambers sister, that poor girl whitney, talking to girls on a tv show with visible injuries, where she clearly eledged it was done by Amber.

The extent to which you people need evidence of a mans abuse to give him ANY shred of empathy is something that is just can not comprehend. its actually fucking terrifying. 

It's very simple CNN. In light of the horrible consequences of false accusations of DV or SV and the obvious monetary advantages associated with making fraudulent claims, questioning, in a constructive and fair way, the validity of any accusations towards any gender isnt, misogynistic, or racist. It's sensible. We preserve the rights of individuals in western society. Not the rights on one particular gender.

I hope everyone at CNN takes another good HARD look at this trial, and reconsider this narrative. Just think right? Assume Depp is as much of a victim of abuse as I think he is (Im convinced Amber acted with intent and malice to take his money and ruin his life, She is the actual monster. She frightens me. I know Ambers. The destroy men. They take years to recover.) How horribly did you just potentially treat him? If this does not give you pauze for a moment to take another good look, I fear for the future of our species.",2,2022-06-04T18:57:30Z,2022-06-04T18:57:30Z

@ghostlightx9005,"Not remotely shocking. A big win for men, basically. If you actually watched a decent amount of the trial in detail, you'd KNOW the right verdict was reached. And here's a newsflash for that woman speaking at the start, in a legal case each side is contradicting the other in terms of what are the real facts. This means by definition, the jury has to discount the evidence of one of the sides which means they believe they are LYING. It's how the legal system and a jury works. This youtube video is pathetic and yet another example where the media has made up their minds without watching any of the evidence or even having a clue of what has transpired in that court, and are now pissed off that the facts did not fit their narrative.

YOU DO NOT SPEAK FOR ME.  I AM A WOMAN WHO LOVES MEN.   I will not paint all men with this feminist brush.   Good and bad comes in all shapes, sizes, hues/colors and genders.  Amber Hears is a bad apple.  She abused her first wife (info not allowed to be entered into the case), she abused her sister (who is obviously afraid of her), she abused Johnny, she will probably abuse her current lover (this is her pattern, we just have to wait and see).   I pray for Amber and Johnny, that they both get the help they need to work through their personal issues.   What I will not do is fall for the feminist lies that women never lie.  Women lie like a rug.  You can name women you know personally who lie.  So let’s stop the madness and open our eyes.  Amber is a liar. That is what the jury of her piers found.

This so-called major news outlet is using their platform to make the narative that the Depp Vs Heard trial was a ""men vs women"" and that the reason Amber lost is because of the influence of Johnny. That was absolutely not the case and if the people working at CNN actually followed the trial like they're paid to do so, instead of trying to find a ""lawyer"" who is looking for a payday by saying whatever they need them to, this video could have gone very differently. Amber lost because she LIED, under oath at that. We didn't hear anything about her perjury from the people at your network but how the trial was a big win for powerful men. Violence is violence regardless of gender. Your job was to present an unbiased report on the trial based on the information that was there.

The mainstream media is showing their true colors and how they have worked so hard to twist the truth and manipulate public thought.  This is exactly what you pay approx. $200 per month to invite into your home.  Many of us do not look at color, sex, education, career,  or whether someone is ""powerful"" or not, but believe that anyone that commits a crime should be held accountable.  

The two-tier system is promoted by media to the public where absolutely obscene crimes by those from families in power position are not responsible for their crimes.  Heck, they even hand the elections over to them.  

Imagine what your family could enjoy if you did not watch television everyday and how your view of what is happening in the world would change because your natural ability to think would not be re-programed to think the way the media directs you to think.

@homealoneuniverse1221,"Mountain of evidence? You are aware the US trial actually presented much more evidence than was allowed in the UK trial, right? The US jurors had much better information to work with. As for alleged conspiracies of collusion, that sword cuts both directions. If JD could do it, so could AH. Which set of 'conspiring witnesses' do you believe? Again, the only way to know is to study the actual evidence. Areva, I notice you didn't offer any actual analysis on what specific piece of evidence the jury misconstrued. Why not? I'm guessing it's because you didn't look at the evidence. I'm guessing you don't actually care what the evidence is. You've already made up your mind.

Based on what tho, if not the evidence? Based on JD belonging to the wrong class of humans, right? He is male, and he has money. Therefore he is automatically less credible. Have I got that right?

But statistics! Right? LOL. If you really knew anything about statistics, you'd know they are meaningless when evaluating individual cases. Statistically, I'm supposed to have 2.5 children in my very average family. But I don't have 2.5 children. No one actually has 2.5 children. It's nonsense. You can't apply the statistic to the individual case. Same deal with DV/SA. Statistics are helpful. They help the people doing real DV advocacy figure out the big picture. But they tell you NOTHING about any individual case. Men, even men with money, experience DV too, in significant numbers. Look it up. That's why we still operate under the rubric, Innocent Until Proven Guilty. That's how you deal with the discrepancy between statistics and real people. Truth matters.

As a technical matter, I believe you are misstating the legal analysis. The jury did NOT need to disbelieve everything AH said. Realistically, they only had to disbelieve the SA claim in count 1 for everything else to fall into place. As any writer knows, the title sets the context. It was reasonable for the jury to find all the remaining claims defamatory, because their impact in that context was to advance claims of SA and DV that AH failed to prove.  

As for impact on DV survivors, everyone I know in the DV community, of all genders, is good with this outcome. It is well known that systematic abusers (of either gender) frequently try to flip the script on their victims and drag them through the courts portraying the victim as the abuser. But for those who know what it's actually like living with an abuser, watching and listening to those two go at it in all those recordings, it was absolutely chilling how AH sought out the conflict and JD tried to escape it, over and over and over again. You want to be truly horrified, get off your political soapbox for a minute and listen to the 10 or so hours of recorded material available to this jury. There is a damn good reason they drew the conclusion they did. It's about the evidence, not the politics.",1,2022-06-04T16:15:15Z,2022-06-04T16:15:33Z

@Arrogan28,"If there was on bit, one single bit of believable evidence at all, that wasn't just 'Amber said', or Amber's psychiatrist paid to be an expert who said 'Well this happened because Amber said...',, or any believable photo that hadn't had it's record of it's origins purposely deleted by Amber's team, because they deleted the originals and kept screen grabs they sent to Johnny's team, ensuring that no forensic analysis could be done on the photos. That is just nasty.  And the few photos they eventually were forced to sent to Johnny's team so late that they had basically no time to analyze the files, showed that the photos had been brought into photo editing programs and were at the very least manipulated in some fashion.
There wasn't a single photo of a bruise that didnt' have 50 other photos take right after that alleged beating that Johnny 'broke her nose, gave her two black eyes, and nearly put her teeth completely through her lip' yet it only left a tiny bruise, that the very next day and the day after, was not visible in hundreds of photos taken by friends, surveillance cameras, in friends photos who magically took those photos down the day before Amber filed restraining order, then suddenly all those photos her friends took of her during that time were taken off their social media pages.  But they were recovered, and shown to show Amber without a single mark on her face.  She was on talk shows right after alledged insanely violent attacks, again so violent I can't repeat it here, and yet she was scrunching up her face, hyper acting out stories on the couch, bent over, even though she had just had something done to her that most women would have been in the hospital for at least a week afterwards for, and at the very least could not move for days as she was moving, walking up, bouncing on the couch, etc for a long time afterwards.  

But despite all this if Amber produced just one, just one believable bit of evidence the Jury and most people would have agreed Johnny lost the case because even one incident would have allowed her legally to say what she did. But there was none, and being caught in lie after lie, the entire ""I used pledge and donate synonimously..."", as well as the 'That is not what I am saying on that audio tape..' which the entire room was shocked, some chins on the ground when Amber blatantly is denying what she said and Johnny agreed upon in the audio tapes..  She just could not stop lying, and the Jury realized what this woman was capable of, pieced together with zero evidence, and they did the obvious choice then, side with truth, and against lies, and liars.  The Jury ignored the fact that Johnny was a man, and listened to the mountain of evidence that supported that he was the abused one in the relationship. Including audio tapes of Amber admitting, not once, but several times that she was the one chasing him around, that she was the one who was punching him, kicking the door in his face.. taking off his finger with a bottle she threw.... all things she admitted on the audio tapes, which she tried to claim were not what everyone could clearly hear them to be... 

So this woman is just an embarrassement to try to claim to be some expert in abuse cases, and not have cared what the real evidence in the trial, showed, it means that Areva would side with the abuser often because she doesn't care what the evidence proves, she just decides that this is a powerful person, then they must be guilty according to her.  She doesnt' care about evidence she makes her mind up based on what 'category' of person she decides they are in her own head, and labels them as a monster purely based on that. If they are a rich man, she believes they are guiltily period,  even when she is clearly a raging insane liar, she believes the liar, and the real abuser because she is herself an abuser of the truth for her own ideology.  Which I am sorry, is not progressive, is not the #metoo movement, it is a small percentage of outspoken women(and a few men) who put their ideology ahead of truth, and they dont' care what the facts are at all....",0,2022-06-04T13:45:37Z,2022-06-04T13:45:37Z

@ChadeGB,"How ironic that Areva Martin is just so adamant that the jury ignored all of AH's evidence, when she's doing exactly what she's accusing them of. The reason the jury discounted the vast majority of AH's ""evidence"" was because there was a mountain of actual evidence that showed most of it either wasn't true or wasn't entirely accurate at best. She discounts the fact that AH took the stand and lied to the jury and judge multiple times, she ignores the recordings of AH berating JD like no abused spouse would ever dare to, she ignores the proof that AH attacked JD on multiple occasions, she ignores how it was clearly established that JD repeatedly tried to remove himself from confrontation and was relentlessly pursued by AH, the list goes on and on.

So, Areva Martin,  the jury sided with JD because his evidence was better, his evidence actually dismantled everything AH's team had and showed that she was not to be trusted, AH herself showed her word could not be trusted.

@Arrogan28,"As a life long progressive, just once again proof that CNN does not represent progressives at all. CNN pushing this woman Areva who clearly never listened to the audio tapes, never looked at all the evidence and thinks that 'evidence' can just be 'well she said...' as a mountain of evidence.  
Here is what Areva did, she listened to Elaine speak didn't go through all the 'mountain of evidence' herself, so she has no clue that when Elaine said for instance that there were 'medical records going back a decade', that what she meant was that there were psychiatry notes from her psychiatrist who believed Amber when Amber told her that Johnny was abusive, period.  Which isn't medical records at all, it is just again Amber saying this and that happened with not a single bit of evidence to prove it happened.  Not a single bit of real medical evidence even after being attacked so violently that I can't even say or have my comment taken down, and yet even her personal nurse who saw her often every couple of days, and sometimes more often never saw one single incident where Amber had bruises, black eyes, or any indications of physical abuse the entire time she was her private nurse at Amber's beck and call the entire time she was with Johnny.  There are limo drivers, the women and men who worked the front desk of the apartment building all testified not a single bruise or mark, except once. one time, when Johnny was away for weeks at the time the bruise appeared, at at the time she was sleeping with Elon Musk in Johnny's penthouses...   So to claim that there was a 'mountain of evidence' regurgitating what Elaine said, is just honestly a joke for this women to repeat that with clearly not having seen the case or the real trial and real evidence presented...
What there is is a real mountain of evidence that not a single thing that Amber said up on that witness stand, or in her UK video deposition, was true, not a single statement.  And worse, the audio tapes records prove that Amber was the abuser, period. And finally the video recordings of Amber taken for the SUN case in the UK were down right chilling,  Not only did Amber commit perjury on those tapes as well, so many times that you can't even count them all, but she completely showed she thought hitting Johnny was funny, that she thought physically assaulting Johnny was hillarious.   She also lied insanely to the lawyers there so blatantly that anyone who believed her is seriously either a complete and utter fool, or they had a motivation to believe her. Like the UK judge whose own son worked for the SUN which was the defendant to Johnny's suit, and that son worked specifically for the person who wrote the article that was published that defamed Johnny blatantly. So the judge has insane conflict of interest that is not a conspiracy theory, but FACT, that is easily verified.  The judge also knew the owner of the SUN personally and hung out together all the time. It was a joke of a trial in the UK.

Areva is just trying to be a 'warrior for women' but is hurting the movement as all victims of abuse who actually have followed the case have come out very strongly against Amber. So for Avera to support Amber because she watched Amber's lawyer Elaine spew complete lies on air, and blame the Jury, and missrepresent the evidence lying that there are medical records, when there is only Amber's testimony only, and that all witnesses outside of the people who were going to get a one of Johnny's penthouses if they lied to help out Amber, besides that group that conspired against johnny after he was insanely generous to them, all the other witnesses have testified that Amber was the abuser, Amber was the aggressor. it was Amber who was yelling and screaming in the Trailer part incident cause she was jealous Johnny was giving attention to other people around the camp fire, and she lost her mind out in the middle of the trailer park screaming and pushing Johnny. Not the actions of an abused woman 'scared for her life' as she has claimed.  
Areva, and CNN should be embarrassed by this coverage..

Areva at least see what all abused woman are saying who actually watched the trial and have actually looked at the evidence. Don't watch a few minutes of Elaine spewing lies and come on here pretending you know the case..  Embarrassing...
CNN should apologize for this for all the abused victims who have all spoken out against Amber's obvious lies... the vast vast majority of Abuse victims are speaking out all in favor of Johnny and against Amber....
Which is not what being a progressive, or a left leaning person is about.  Progressive means you believe in science, in evidence, in truth, in reason, and fact.  You don't put totaliarian like ideology over truth, or morality, as those things hurt innocent people, like Johnn, as it did.  
The #metoo movement is about protecting woman.  Amber was protected, right away, and Johnny was instantly canceled...  women who are in abusive relationships need to be believed right away to protect them and keep abused women and kids safe.  That is a good idea, and it is what happened. But we also have a thing called 'innocent until proven guilty' in modern free countries. And that is when the accused must have a fair chance to clear their name, and prove they were innocent.  And that happened, and Johhny was proven innocent despite the deck being stacked in Ambers favor as far as a verdict like this.  Johnny already won before the verdict because it was undeniable that he had been telling the truth all along, and the verdict was beautiful because it showed by a system based on a Jury of our peers can work, because they could not deny the evidence against Amber and for Johnny's side of events, and his narrative of what had happened in each of the alleged incidents.  And it was just so overwhelmingly clear, that the entire world has sided with Johnny Depp, and only those few people who never watched the trial, or who are somehow tied to this idea of 'believe only women forever no matter if they are lying' and those people are the true people hurting the #metoo movement, not this verdict against Amber which was ultimately a victory for the victims, which Johnny Depp was, and still is really...",0,2022-06-04T13:20:47Z,2022-06-04T13:53:03Z

Everyone who works with DV survivors has said that Johnny shows clear signs of being abused and Amber shows clear signs of being the abuser.

Anyone actually watching the trial - the evidence, the witnesses, Johnny & Amber's testimonies - could see clearly that she was the abuser and he was the victim.

She lied constantly and her own recordings showed her to be the aggressor with Johnny trying to get away from her and her chasing him down, berating and belittling him.

Next time how about ask an ""expert"" who actually watched the trial & verdict that they are giving an opinion on.

What about his kids being harrassed and their father being called a wife beater for the past 6 years. The money that he lost, the properties, and people he needed to let go bec no one was hiring him.
What about those people?

Amber did this all to herself. She lied over and over. No jury, no person can trust any word that comes out of her mouth now.

She extorted a total of 14mil from JD.
She could have donated the 7mil to children's hospital as what she is parading.
Banked the 7mil.
She got a Mera, which she was paid a total of 3mil.
And live comfortably for the rest of her life.
What the hell she still wants?

Her jealousy and obssession with JD's success is too strong, she just cant let go.

@bubble8829,"GO AND WATCH THE TRIAL BEFORE YOU PRESUME TO HAVE ANY OPINIONS THAT ARE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE OF THE CASE.  Otherwise, you just look like idiots.

There is no ""mountain of evidence"" to show Amber Heard was abused by Johnny Depp.  There is Amber Heard's own word, which is contradicted by a great deal of evidence, and by the word of a lot of other witnesses.  And there is her sister's word, also contradicted by a great deal of evidence and by the word of a lot of other witnesses.  So who would you believe?  

One kid in class named Ruby says, ""Mikey pulled my hair and made me cry. It gave me this bruise on my arm.""  All the other kids say, ""Actually, Ruby pulled Mikey's hair and made him cry, and he beat her hand away to save himself.  That's why she has a bruise on her arm.""  Ruby says, ""They're all lying.  You should believe me because I know I'm telling the truth.""  All the other kids plus Mikey go, ""Huh?""  Who would you believe?  THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE.  If you vote for Mikey over Ruby, you're voting for Johnny Depp over Amber Heard.  And it's that clear that Amber Heard LIED.

And for fuck's sake, shut up about the UK trial.  That was a completely different case, about a different matter, in a different country with completely different processes, in which Amber Heard herself was not a party.  Before 2022, Amber Heard herself has never before had to defend her allegation against Johnny Depp.  And I say ""defend her allegations"" in all seriousness, because the burden of proof is on her in our judicial system that goes back centuries.  Our justice says: INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.  So you can't assume Johnny Depp is guilty and suggest he has to prove he isn't.  The burden of proof is on Amber Heard to prove what she says is true.  THAT'S HOW JUSTICE WORKS.


Is Areva Martin seriously trying to say:

*  Amber Heard should be believed even though it's so obvious from evidence and testimonies that SHE LIED?

*  The jury should have found in Amber Heard's favour even though it was blatantly obvious that SHE WAS LYING and no one could believe – or have a clue what if anything to believe out of – what came out of her mouth.  _Falsus in uno; falsus in omnibus_ .

*  ""Less than 10% of women lie about being sexually abused""?  Therefore we should believe all women irrespective of evidence?  NEWS FLASH, news people: AMBER HEARD WAS IN THAT LESS THAN 10% WHO LIE.  SHE LIED.  Who cares about the statistics after that?  G and actually watch Amber Heard's ""testimony"" that you're supporting, and the rebuttals to her testimony.  SHE LIED.

*  It was a ""spectacle"" with the cameras in the courtroom?  No.  It was transparent.  So that now, those of us who actually care about truth and justice, irrespective of gender and identity politics, and regardless of what spin and lies you want to add to Amber Heard's own spin and lies – we can assess the truth for ourselves.  And that truth is, AMBER HEARD LIED.  She lied so much and so often – and her lies were proven in the courtroom – it's impossible to accept her allegations against Johnny Depp. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp proved pretty substantially that Amber Heard was a physical and mental abuser against him.  So the jury arrived at the reasonably sensible conclusion that her outlandish accusations could not be supported, and even if she suffered any minor injuries, they were at most the result of Johnny Depp defending himself and/or trying to restrain her when she was physically violent.  Go figure.  A woman can actually throw bottles and punches.  Who'd have thought it?  You know what else?  Women are humans too, with human failings, and sometimes those failings include violence and LYING.

*  You worry that this verdict could be a setback for women who wish to allege abuse against ""powerful men""?  Fine.  But blame Amber Heard, not the jury, or all the witnesses who testified against Heard's lies, or the lawyers who did a sterling job representing Johnny Depp's case, or Judge Azcarate who ran a very tight ship for six weeks.  Amber Heard and Amber Heard alone is to blame for making up her lies, to cash in on the #metoo movement for her own ends.  She is a clear-cut, self-admitted representative of the ""less than 10% of women who lie"".  Sorry, hate to burst your bubble, but she is.  Deal with it.  And if other female survivors suffer because of this trial, it's her fault, BECAUSE SHE LIED.

Woman, go watch the trial and set your incredulity at rest.  Amber Heard did actually make up ""each and every"" allegation.  She's a violent, manipulative, selfish, self-absorbed, possibly man-hating liar.

Why is your only concern about women who allege abuse?  What about the men who are abused – like Johnny Depp was abused by Amber Heard – as the evidence showed and Amber Heard herself actually admitted in evidence?  

GO AND WATCH THE TRIAL BEFORE YOU PRESUME TO HAVE ANY OPINIONS THAT ARE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE OF THE CASE.  Otherwise, you just look like idiots.

* DO NOT ""BELIEVE ALL WOMEN.""  *LISTEN* TO WOMEN.  LISTEN TO MEN TOO.  THEN INVESTIGATE.  AND BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE.

@carolxs,"Initially my inclination was on believing Heard. But I've seen the whole evidence that was in the trial, and Heard simply is not believable, especially because she alleges horrible violence with injuries which in no way she could have sustained without looking for medical assistance. Having her nose broken, being dragged over broken glass, punched repeatedly in the face, being dragged by her hair, thrown on top of a ping pong table with such force that apparently it broke the table... having her head bashed on to a wall with violent force... She claimed all of that for a single night. When asked if she took a picture, she shows pictures of writings on a mirror and broken bottles, and the only picture of her injuries show only a little redness on the cheek. And even the pictures with subtle redness have been shown to have been edited! Can we agree the description of violence does not match the picture? That's very weak testimony, and if the UK judge thought her word was enough... He is not a good judge.

Now, does that mean he never abused her? I don't think so. In fact, I think there is enough evidence to support an argument for emotional abuse. However, there's also plenty of evidence and audio of her own voice admitting she started physical fights and that she hit him, but he was a baby for complaining.
If I were to guess, I would say they were both violent with each other and it's hard to know if there was a primary aggressor. But because she painted herself as the passive victim, a perfect angel who only wanted to help but was viciously beaten, she manipulated and twisted the truth. I feel bad for both and hope they can treat themselves and heal. But AMBER DOES NOT REPRESENT WOMEN.",0,2022-06-04T09:44:58Z,2022-06-04T09:50:28Z

ALSO ALSO - The UK vs. The Sun case had NOTHING to do with the US case vs. Amber - and the judge had conflicts of interest! The two are not relatable - and can NOT be used as an argument - which is why it was not allowed as ""evidence"" in the trial vs. Amber.

I am not a Deff fan and just watched the clips that I chanced upon. It was disgusting to see and hear her testimony. She didn't manifest any sign of having been abused. She didn't present a mountain of evidence but of falsehood and fabrication.

She was taunting, insulting and gaslighting the man she claims to have abused her. She never exhibited any fear of being hit by him in the audio and video presented. She just kept pursuing and mocking him. She clearly liked filming and taking photos; why was there not ever a photo of herself with the abuse she allegedly suffered? Why take photos of broken bottles etc instead? To show Depp as a man who broke things, to show him in a bad light and instill in other people's minds he was a violent man and capable of doing harm? There was never any audio of him admitting to hitting her. It was all of her chasing him and  abusing him despite him speaking calmly or hiding from her. 

It's just really despicable that she dared represent the victims of domestic abuse with her sickening arrogance and fakery. 

The publication of her op ed in time for the release of her movie is surely not a mere coincidence. She wanted to promote herself to the devastation of another. 

She's vindictive because she couldn't accept the fact that Depp couldn't stand her and already wanted no more of her, and so she accused him falsely, disregarding all the good he'd done her which was even in their diary.

She's so entangled herself in her web of lies and cannot not lie more to support her fake stories. 

And the mainstream media are talking in support of her, after all those stories that didn't add up, and the inconsistent and fabricated evidences? 

How can anyone believe her? She even flaunted on a show she donated her USD7M divorce settlement which she has not done to date. Anyone who'd watched her on that show would have seen she's a woman who just wanted to prop herself. The arrogance with which she said she wanted nothing of the money - it was just cringe worthy.

Johnny Depp was the victim and Amber Heard was the abuser and there is no getting around that. Media sources for the last 6 years have propped her up and are now frantic trying to explain that the reason she lost is because Johnny has a big stature.

MY EYES ARE OPEN NOW THE MEDIA IS CORRUPT. JAKE I SENT YOU THIS FOLLOWING EMAIL IT WAS A COPY OF AN EMAIL SENT TO AREVA MARTIN WHO OWES JOHNNY AND ALL VICTIMS AN APOLOGY FOR DEFENDING ABUSERS AND ATTACKING THE VICTIM. 
Jake I've always loved your show but the way you reported on the Johnny Depp Verdict was horrible. Mostly because of Areva Martin. She owes a lot of people an apology. Here is what I wrote to Areva Martin about how I feel. 
Areva Martin. 
Let me tell you as a woman and survivor of domestic violence woman like you disgust me. I used to watch you but never again now that I see your true colors. You woman who don't know the facts and you speak up for the abuser and against the real Victim Johnny. You Women that do this are the ones that are really setting woman back! 🤬You should be ashamed! Amber says she's an advocate for women and a voice for women of domestic violence. She's a Liar and she was never a victim.  The truth always comes to light and when it does of course it has the chance of hurting other real victims of domestic abuse. Maybe someone won't be believed all because of Amber's lies.  Not only is she not an advocate she abuses not only Johnny but she is hurting other real abused victims. I'm so sick of women saying this is a step back for women because the Liar that wasn't abused was found guilty. I don't feel this is a set back because Amber is in a whole nother league of her own. Whether you're Male or Female and if you have a half a brain you see right through her. So I don't think women who are really abused will be looked at the way Lying Amber is looked at. You forget in the beginning everyone believed Amber and Johnny was canceled. He was Guilty until proven innocent. But when all Amber's lies came to the surface people started seeing the truth. Maybe what they should be focusing on is that Men are abused too and they've been too embarrassed or ashamed to come forward but they shouldn't be. Johnny is helping the abused men have a voice. I swear I can't wrap my brain around the way some people think. And let me point out again that Amber is the real villain how dare she pretend she's an advocate for abuse when she doesn't give a damn how this is hurting real woman of domestic abuse. Amber in her statement said that it was because of her powerful husband that no one looked at the mountains of evidence. Reality check she had no evidence it was a lie which is why she lost. She also talked about her right for freedom of speech and she was silenced. She's so Delusional reality check yes we all have a right of freedom of speech but we don't have the right to defame someone and tell lies and ruin their life. She hasn't learned a thing you can tell in the statement she put out after she lost. They are the same words that landed her in court and ruined her career and got her bankrupt and probably soon jail and she deserves it all. She's a selfish self centered person. People like Amber never blame themselves for their own actions its never their fault. TRUTH! You need to watch this YouTube of Lawyer Nate talking about you! He is 100 percent correct!

AH has been torturing him for years maliciously. It's NOT SPLIT VERDICT, and any media/journalist or press organization that spins it that way is not truthful and lying to people.

@lexyortiz5412,"It's sad than anybody still believes her after her own 'mountain of evidence' proved that SHE was the abuser and that she faked/edited photos of injuries.  It's also a shame that her threats to put fake bruises on and take pictures if JD didn't give her everything she wanted THE DAY BEFORE she alerted TMZ to come photograph her 'bruise' as soon as JD denied her all the money and property she was demanding from him.  She literally sent text messages.  None of this was allowed in court.  As for the UK case, it wasn't against scAmber so no evidence was allowed to refute her lies or prove her perjury.  Not to mention the judge was corrupt, his wife knew scAmber and his son worked for the publication JD was suing, which is why he RETIRED directly after that case!  This ruling is a TOTAL WIN for all REAL VICTIMS of dv/sa, and a warning to those willing to lie and make false accusations as an act of revenge!

Areva COULD NOT have watched a majority of the US case and say with a straight face what she is saying. PLUS, anybody who thinks ALL women ALWAYS tell the truth in ANY kind of situation, including abusive ones, is delusional. Men don't have a monopoly on lying! There are just some bad people in the world, and some of those are men and some are women. I can't stand blind team mentality. It is ignorant and harmful.  ...   And there is not even any proof that Johnny had anything at all to do with his former attorney's decision to make a statement that Amber tried to stage one crime scene. The fact that he was found liable for that is so unfair. But even if he did tell his lawyer to say that, which I highly doubt, that is NO WHERE NEAR or remotely comparable to the life-destroying ""wife-beater"" sacrilege Amber falsely accused him of.

While it is true that it is hard for women to get justice for the abuse they suffer, it is even harder for men because no one will even listen to them. If they ask for help or admit to it they get laughed at. (Just look at SNL making fun of JD.) 
This is a great win for domestic violence victims of ANY gender. 
The Abuser lost, her lies were exposed for the world to see, and people are starting to see that Equality only works when all sides are treated equal.

You really need to change the name of the Me-Too Movement.. you should call it Just-Us Without Amber Heard Movement and just get over it.. He Won, She lied.. And one more thing.. Look up the Australia audio of that day where he lost his finger and tell me what happened.. They wouldn't allow that to be played in court because one of the voices on that audio is dead now.. And really that's all the evidence one would need to put this lie to rest.. the audio you can her saying that she was sorry for what she did and that she didn't mean to do that, while the entire time they were looking for his finger.. I want the audio you hear Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, his doctor and nurse.. Also the security person, and he's the one that passed away.. And there's also several hours of audio with them arguing online now.. I played them through a decent Amplified Bluetooth Speaker and that is needed to get the just of it.. On several spots of the audio recordings you can tell that she's talkin lower and he cannot hear her.. So she can make fake evidence against him..  And if you don't believe me then there's a channel that has one of the videos broken-down that proves it.. the channel name is Christina Pykles and a video length is 19:52 long..

@t.soares1125,"Why does she think the jury got it wrong? The judge in the UK trial assumed that she did in fact ""donate"" the money. That isn't true (fact).  A lot of Depp's evidence wasn't admittedly in the UK trial. There was a lot more evidence in this trial and both had evidence that wasn't allowed in. There's a lot out there that wasn't admitted and that is available to the public that makes her look even worse.

What mountain of evidence is she referring to? What she stated happened and the evidence submitted do not match. And, by the way, she actually wasn't on trial in the UK case, the Sun was.  I watched this whole trial and went in not knowing much about it. In the end, I think it was pretty clear. The jury got it right in my opinion and determined that she was lying and did so to cause him harm. All genders are capable of vile things and that's what the evidence seems to suggest here for Heard. I think based on the preponderance of evidence from both sides, the decision makes sense. His version of the story is far more consistent, more believable and bared out by the facts. 

I'm sorry, this isn't about men and women. This case is about Depp and Heard. They do not represent an entire gender.  If people want to make this about broader societal issues, that's on them. Men can be abused too.

The vast majority of women who claim DV or SV are telling the truth. Everyone should be listened to and all allegation should be taken seriously and investigated. We can't just state that we believe someone based on their gender or because it is consistent with our ideology or something? We want to be true. We need to listen to the facts.

@bmuseo,"To put it bluntly, this is a load of crap! Did any of these so-called reporters watch the trial? The evidence was crap and so photoshopped. Her picture of bruises without makeup didn't even look like a natural bruises, but rather like color edited countouring makeup. The colors were way to even. Bruises are multicolor. Ice may reduce swelling, but it doesn't make it disappear. Amber's stories changed and never matched with her friends accounts, not to mention the police. The apartment was torn apart, yet it miraculously was put in order within an hour or two before the police showed up? Remember when the police camera showed all of the tchochkes were everywhere in perfect place including the random signs of life, like a purse and daily items placed around the room? Oooh, a picture of spilled wine? With all of the drinking going on, are you surprised there is spilled wine? You all are making laughing stock of yourselves. And for your information, I'm not a big movie buff. Hollywood hardly ever creates good movies anymore. I only started watching when a coworker mentioned it. I had absolutely no opinion either way until I watched the trial. Amber herself ruined her credibility. She repetitively lied and her witnesses were half baked yes-men. I'm sure Depp is not perfect, but I don't believe he was the abuser. In the recordings, Amber always seemed to be trying to ratchet the arguments up, while Depp tried to keep it calmer or disappear.
This is not about men or women, it's about RIGHTING A WRONG. To say this sets women back is only correct if you continue to perpetuate her lies and the lies of those like her. A person of honour admits their errors, shortcomings, and THE TRUTH, they do not cry ""wolf"" where there is none! Forget this nonsense of ""his/her"" truth; it is a lie! There is only THE TRUTH!

@dani3640,This is why I have stopped watching the main stream Media.  On something like the Depp Heard case there was an extreme amount of evidence to prove she was a liar and an abuser. She is a self admitted abuser and liar. If we now need more evidence than what was presented in this case then women or men of domestic violence are in trouble. This lady gets on TV and says well what amber says on those tapes does not count because well she's a woman. WE all know had that been JD saying those things she would be saying lock him up  He does not fit their profile for domestic abuse. So in her head what we must do is punish the victim (JD) at all cost. This is some backwards crap. I do not know who this woman is but as a woman she does not speak for me. We don't decide victims on whether they are male or female because at the end of the day they are human beings. I find it disgusting that the me too movement made Amber an ambassador and they have no one to blame but themselves. To go around and try to destroy and minimize JD claims and the jury's verdict and continue to make amber a victim just goes to show this movement is not about me too it's just about them. I suggest they get wiser people to speak out on their behalf if not they will lose trust and support from the women who have suffered from abuse.,0,2022-06-04T00:54:55Z,2022-06-04T00:54:55Z

@colleenkerr4237,"Seriously makes me sick that CNN analyst think Amber should have won. I agree with others statement, that OBVIOUSLY you did NOT watch the trial. Depp's story has NEVER changed, not once! Amber's story on the other hand changed multiple times and after 6 years she added stuff. She was fake AF on the stand and couldn't even cry. Most of the time ""Real"" DV & SA victims have a very hard time getting on that stand and it's very traumatic to get up there and relieve what you be through. She had no problem what so ever. I mean come on her bruise didn't even appear for 6 days After she seen Depp. She called TMZ and told them what side of her face, yet miraculously the bruise was gone the very next day. She was out the next day after the court house visit living it up laughing on the street with her EX friends. She let Franco over the very same night she changed the locks. She was in a full blown relationship with Elon Musk 3 week after filling the TRO, but here they were actually seeing each other a whole yr while she was married. She would egg Depp on during fights. He'd try to walk away & she'd chase him. What really gets me is she had no problem taking pics of Johnny passed out but not one single pic of her beaten up. Then to make matters worse her lawyer is going on every national TV station and blaming first Johnny on one channel, then Johnny's lawyers on another station and now blaming the jury on another channel saying oh I know they watched Twitter and tictok and the news while we were in a week break and when they went home every night.

Believe every victim until the evidence shows lies and distorted facts. This case exposed a woman who lied about small things, who lied about medium things, who lied about big things. Irrefutable facts, but we are supposed to overlook that because she's a woman?! WTF kind of twisted misogyny is THAT?  

It's not ok to ruin a person's life""for the good of the movement"". MeToo needs to distance themselves from Heard ASAP. They are setting the bad example here.

Of course a lot of us liberal progressive feminists are well aware that women lie and commit crimes - cause people do that. In this case DEPP was the victim so this whole video is victim bashing!

@KingOfFvckingEverything,"Arghh.. it was not just about the headline! READ the verdict forms! It was Heards team who wanted  it to say headline and not statement, have the other statements separate. 
This woman on the owner doesn’t think very far. Nor do the men it seems, but please ask yourselves the following.
What if it happened to you? That one day you are not only falsely accused if physical abuse but now also sexual violence?? Imagine the shock.
You lose your job, your friends. Imagine also if it happened to  your father, your husband, partner or brother, your own son! A crazy woman coming out and accusing him. You wouldn’t sit and believe what you just said here, that’s for sure. 
The mainstream medias reporting and labels are such hypocrites and can’t be trusted. 
This is as much important for men as it is for women btw.
The outpour we have seen from female victims of domestic violence was astounding! 8m one of them. Very few are Depp fans. We know who he is, but I haven’t seen any if his movies. We saw for ourselves the evidence, their testimonies. Ms Beard lied so many times in the stand, Why shirked we believe her if she lies about one thing? She didn’t take ANY accountability that she acted wrong,
She didn’t say it was dumb to speak on a tv show, bragging about having donated her 7 million which was a LIE. She tried to weasel herself out if it by saying “I couldn’t give any thing because Johnny sued me,,,   Again false,  SHE had the seven mill in her account for over a year and didn’t donate anything! 
Btw, don5 get it twisted, it was Ms Heard who threatened to sued Johnny for defamation before her Op Ed.
She couldn’t ,et him live in peace.  He was forced to take her to court because otherwise she would have talked about him forever!
Who on earth can blame him for it? He really tried t9 talk sense with her in one of the many recordings but she used extortions, such as corroboration, evidence. That’s when she said “see why wil believ you Johnny, a man, for being a victim of domestic violence and see if the judge and jury, the world will believe you”.  That’s s9 disgusting and threatening coming from her.
Do t forget her extortion letter she and her lawyer sent to him just days after his mom died, when he was in Europe, before the restraining order. They gave him less than a week to agree to give her the penthouses,  at and 50k a month otherwise she would seek restrung order and go public. He didn’t like to be extorted so we saw what she did when he didn’t agree with her extortion.
Regardless, he have her 7 million and in there was a clause prohibiting BOTH parties for: speaking Anita their relationship.
She breached that when she wrote that Op Ed!!  OF COURSE IT WAS ABoUT JOHNNY.  Who else had she been dating two years prior??.
Elon Musk? James Franco?? THINK before you speak woman, in that kamel, the men too.",0,2022-06-03T23:58:53Z,2022-06-04T00:03:43Z

REAL victims of abuse hate Amber Heard! She's an abuser and you, ma'am are  an abuse ENABLER. In fact, the verdict correctly identifies Amber Heard as the abuser and Johnny Depp is the one true victim at the trial. Victim of Amber Heard. Did you even listen to the evidence? Or do you just open your mouth and say stuff and hope it sticks? There is a fact that you need to know and it is not a new fact. The fact is there are very bad women in this world who have been abusing kind men. They physically abuse them; goading them to try and force them to hit them so they can call the cops. They commit parental alienation. They make false testimony against their husbands accusing them of non-existent abuse. They poison their husbands. They exploit their husbands. They parasitically feed off of their husbands. They robbed their husbands. They neglect their husbands. They cheat on their husbands in extra marital affairs. As the primary female role model, these women teach their daughters to do the same to men and as the primary female role models, they teach their sons that that is all they deserve to be treated like garbage just like the mother treats the father. You people at CNN are vile, corrupt, despicable ABUSE ENABLERS and you CNN Representatives and monsters like Amber Heard set the me too movement back into the dark ages! Johnny Depp winning judgment on this trial is a huge and monumental win for men everywhere. For all REAL abuse victims men and women. NOW BEHOLD, as your viewership plummets in direct response to your irresponsible news casting. You have the power and you abuse the arbitrary power and hurt good people. This is going to come back and bite you. The strongest person has the capacity to hurt someone and chooses not to. You are not the strongest people. You are solids. Black woman with your big earrings you may consider yourself correctly as an embarrassment to the female race. Shame on you. I hope you're not a mother because you are not correctly having a capacity to identify a real abusive woman. A sea hag named Amber Heard. And you men standing there with your suit and ties pretending that you are all sophisticated
... You are very embarrassing representatives of CNN and all three of you should be fired for this crap you were spewing on the news; misrepresenting a very good outcome of a trial that says finally no to women beating men; putting out cigarette on the man's face, punching him in the head while he's sleeping, committing adultery non-stop in and out like a turnstile while Johnny is at work, inviting parasitic friends to turn the beautiful homes into a flop houses. And you endorse this. Conclusion? birds of a feather. All three of you must be of the same ilk. What happens behind your closed doors? Lady are you hitting your husband?

@justkaren6450,"Apparently, Areva didn't watch the trial, for starters. Secondly, the UK case was not against Amber Heard, it was against the publication, The Sun. From what I understand, the judge in the libel case from the UK decided because Johnny Depp has struggled with addiction for decades, nothing he said was credible, which was wrong.
  Now, just because Miss Areva Martin, you happen to obviously be a man-hater and a bigot....that doesn't make you correct. I watched the trial from beginning to end. There was not one damn thing that came out of Amber's mouth or the mouths of any of her experts, that should be deemed as evidence. Thank GOD the jury didn't have the same man-hating ways as this woman here. 
   One thing you are right about is this being a big win for men, but the insinuation being made by the word powerful is just plain wrong. Her opinion is as bad as Amber Heard's, and until now, I had yet to see someone who supported her. I think it takes an extremely gullible bigot to believe anything that lying hussy said! How many times did we hear the phrase, or something else that meant the phrase, ""I could never hurt Johnny'? She didn't say, I never hit Johnny....she said she couldn't hurt Johnny. Which, in the heat of the moment, probably ticked her off more than anything. Nobody is trying to imply Amber Heard was capable to kicking Johnny's butt or beat him beyond recognition, that's not the issue with female abusers.
  The problem with female abusers is they are usually with a man who WON'T hit them back. They can hit a man over and over and over and over, if he won't fight back (because society has taught him he can't hit a female, even while she keeps assaulting him), that is abuse. And, even worst than just domestic violence is the mental and emotional toll that would take. Personally, if you didn't watch the trial or were too ignorant to understand why Depp won this one, then I don't think you should give your opinion on the matter. If that women is affiliated with CNN, then they just lost another viewer. When CNN makes me agree with Fox News....I can no longer watch it!",0,2022-06-03T23:38:50Z,2022-06-03T23:38:50Z

Let me get this straight: It’s NOT.a setback for women!! Anyone including Ms Heard and this panel who believes that needs to understand this: What she did was really harmful to REAL victims of abuse. Both women and men.
Why has this trial meant so much for victims everywhere (women and men)? Because they are sick of this bullshit MeToo narrative. It’s destroying it for real victims out there. It was never a grassroots movement but a highly coordinated politicked movement funded by ACLU, DNC and other left wing organizations.

Anyone who thinks we should believe all women are delusional. There are plenty if female murders  and abusers out there. Why would we believe a woman just because of her gender? Where is the equality in that? 
This trial was also so important for all the men out there who never had a chance against their ex wives, can’t see their kids. Some of them are no longer on this 9net because they couldn’t stand seeing without seeing their kids. It’s very true that the court favors women in family law.
Don’t you think that hurts so many men? Women can be extremely manipulative and it doesn’t take a lot of lies for her to get full custody. She can lie and say he’s violent without any shred of evidence.

Look at all the comments here and all over the place. You are on the wrong side of history by sticking up for a lying, conniving abuser instead of daring to believe that men can be victims too. I am myself a survivor of DV and I have eyes, ears, and a brain and could easily see that Amber was lying almost every time she opened her mouth.

She also hasn't a clue about the UK trial. Heard wasn't a defendant, the Sun tabloid was, so discovery wasn't allowed. The evidence Depp presented in the VA trial wasn't allowed in the UK. 
Judge Nichol believed Heard's LIE about already having paid the Children's Hospital and ACLU. He should have recused himself, anyway,  for conflict of interest because of his son's ties to the Sun's parent company.

The jury based there decision on facts. trial testimony and evidence.  It does run against the faction of MeToo that hijacked and important principle and took it to an extreme. 

That extreme   makes any woman who claims abuse the MOST  powerful person in that equation, and evidence be damned. Heard leveraged that extreme faction of MeToo  and got by with it for 6 years.  Finally, the truth prevailed in this courtroom.",0,2022-06-03T23:28:00Z,2022-06-03T23:28:00Z

@MukiMuki688,"Amber didn't think Johnny would be so willing to show all the ugly bits of his life to the world just to expose her. She probably thought that was the safety net against ever having to corroborate her claims, Johnny being too shamed and scared that the world will see his flaws. But she harmed him and his name enough that he probably thought “Well I’ve got nothing to lose; let's do this. You have more to be exposed than me.”\

“That’s why I wrote the op-ed.” Amber wasted a lot of the court's time trying to dismiss the case because she denied writing the op-ed. If this wasn’t televised the world would never get to witness all the evil that is Amber Heard.

Amber: Tell them, Johnny Boi. Tell them and see who sides with you...
Johnny: ...Okay

@neryskkiran1820,"Progressive feminist here. I had no opinion or favor for either Heard or Depp before this trial started. I've worked in battered women's shelters, and am a survivor myself. I watched the trial, and I believe the trial outcome is correct. Depp is a survivor of domestic violence inflicted by Heard. If you hadn't already come to that conclusion, then you need to watch the trial as well. I guarantee that you won't look at it in the same way by the time you get even a third of the way through.    



This trial outcome hasn't set women back. It hasn't set back SA and IPV and DV victims and survivors. It has shown that no matter what, it's worth it to stand up for yourself, and tell your own side. This will ultimately enhance the strength of MeToo, in that the movement will not be usurped by an abuser claiming victimhood. It's not 'believe all women'; it's believe all victims/survivors. It's looking at women and men equally. If women can be victims, so can men. If men can be abusers, then so can women. 



I was astonished and so deeply disappointed watching and reading coverage of this case by news outlets that I've been turning to for years. The subject is important to me, and I had the opportunity, and made the point of watching each day of the trial. At the end of each day, it was clear from the reporting that many of these journalists hadn't been doing more than reading other source summaries -- often-time basic facts were reported wrongly -- conspicuously incorrect to anyone who had watch that day's trial. Holy sh*t!



It turns out they were reporting on a celebrity trial. But they were supposed to be reporting on a domestic abuse trial. And they were reporting in alignment with their political leanings, not with the truth. 

As I mentioned, I'm a progressive. I'm a feminist. To hear incorrect reporting that turns out to be politically aligned with the so-called progressive or left view, to hear trusted sources deliver outraged reports about the treatment of Amber Heard, saying she's a victim; a survivor; a MeToo; a representative of DV-IPV-SV -- to hear all this at the end of a day watching the trial -- I feel like I'M being gaslit!  



For years, who's been saying the left/progressive media isn't truthful in their reporting?   I'll tell you who: The FAR-RIGHT!!!!    WHAT the ACTUAL FLUFF?!!!    Those aren't my people!!! 

But now I'm in a situation where I'm agreeing with what my political opposites are saying about the reporting on my side, at least on this one topic, and OMG, WTF?!!!!   You can see how I'm feeling gaslit!!!  Have I been wrong about other things as well? But I have to set that mind-warping dilemma aside for now, because that's a whole other thing that can't be looked at right now. 


Because this is a very complicated case. That the people involved are celebrities is irrelevant, except for that without their money and fame, this trial would never have happened, much less been opened up for anyone and everyone to see.

It's very easy to look at TikTok or some blurb for a summary of what happened. But in this case -- and this is a very important trial -- if you believe in MeToo, if you want the truth, then I implore you to watch it. If you want to know who was the victim and who was the abuser then please watch it. Go to any of the LawTube channels. Some of the hosts have clear political leanings, but ignore that part - it's irrelevant - and listen to the trial. Do some research of your own. 

If women and men are equal, then their voices must be heard equally. Likewise, women and men are equally capable of cruelty, and necessitate equal scrutiny. 


To diminish men's voices because our own has been stifled for so long is not progress. If we're going to demand and expect that all women who are, who have, and who might have been abused are listened to, then men MUST have the same right. We cannot overcorrect to compensate ourselves for past injustices. We have to level it now, or it will continue to swing back and forth. 

And so, it cannot then be that ALL WOMEN must be BELIEVED. Instead, it must be that ALL PEOPLE must be LISTENED to. We have to listen very carefully. And that -- the listening, is the key, and is the difficult part of this case. It's the difficult part of everything.


Amber Heard got to speak. Johnny Depp got to speak. They both said some awful things. In the end, I believe that Johnny Depp proved that what he said about what happened between them was true. I did not believe Heard. She did not prove her case. Please watch it yourself. At the end, I think the acceptance of her story does and has done a terrible disservice to all people who have been abused.",0,2022-06-03T22:53:54Z,2022-06-03T22:53:54Z

@nickespinosa7154,"Did Areva watch the trial? With all the evidence brought forth by Amber and her team, there was not a shred of physical abuse. When facts are flashed to your face about your own stories and show inconsistencies, when you show photos of evidence of everything but don't have the actual photos of bruises of the alleged abuse, how is that going to be believed. Yes, they were both verbally abusing each other but she physically abused him and instigated most of the arguments. In short, it was a toxic relation but the OP-ed defamed Johnny, that was the case. On top of that, Amber's legal team was outclassed and out witted by Johnny's legal team. Johnny's team were precise, unemotional and matter-of-factly. I imagine it was a very hard case to represent when the cross-examination started. 
Women will always be more believable in abuse cases, hands down, but Areva must admit that there are many times when the man is the one verbally and physically abused...I don't agree with Areva at all.

Believing a domestic violence victim simply because the claim is that they are a domestic violence victim and nothing else has to be the single most stupid idea ever.

And how about the audio tape where she belittles him, calling him ""weak"" and a ""baby"", telling him, ""if you tell that you are being abused, no one will believe you"" (because he's a man and people, like this CNN guest automatically believe the woman and assume the man is guilty).

@barbaralarocque9180,"CNN- Areva Martin first of all the jury got it right they sat through six weeks of Amber and her team lies! She was caught lying over and over again.  I'm so sick of media trying to defend this crazy women the only thing I can think at this time is that you didn't see  all the testimonies and videos played out in court for the past six weeks like the rest of the world did.  Areva Martin you sound so stupid and uneducated.  Not all women are to believed. Just like all men are not to be believed!  The person who TELLS THE TRUTH is the one that is to be BELIEVED PERIOD!!!
  This win for Johnny does not set back women of DV, if anything all of the lies that Amber told has disgusted all the real survivors of DV And SV.  I'm a woman and this stand that CNN is narrating on their show is outrageous and disgusting.  They are  basically saying fuck the evidence fuck the jury and fuck the world because she,s a woman  she should have been believed.  There is all this talk of her having mountain of evidence and yet each day I watched  and  waited to hear it but what we got was lies after lies! And then she couldn't even keep her lies straight!!! 
Areva Martin you sound so stupid we are not interested in hearing your so called expert opinion.  You are supposed to do your job and report the facts and the facts are that Johnny won he proved Amber to be his abuser.  So  you and your CNN team can try to narrate your false story and your false Headlines to the world but it's not going change the fact that Amber heard lost her case because she lied and the jury and the world saw right through her bullshit!!!
All I can say now is CNN you all should be ashamed of yourselves PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!! I hope the world after seeing your show cancels CNN or any other media outlet that wants to throw in their bais apponions instead of reporting the news from a factual basis.

She committed perjury on the stand in Virginia (the donation issue).  She then doubled down on the lie by saying that she did not donate the funds because JD had sued her.

Elaine is walking on broken glasses in regards to Amber and should be very wary of finding herself in a position of being professional compromised if she continues to go down this path.

As a survivor myself I can assure you that Amber was not a victim by any means. The fact that she was caught out to be have repeatedly being  lying on numerous occasions, I find sickling and shocking.

@eddiek8179,"Err. The statement why the jury found the defamation statement for Heard is wrong by the host.  Here's a little bit more info, taken from another commenter who is a lawyer - The only reason she won her ONE counterclaim is because all the officers (JD's witnesses) testified to there only being one 9-1-1 call, when questioned by Amber's attorneys. The officers are not dispatch. They were unaware of how many calls came in to dispatch. Based on their honest (non-biased towards JD testimony), Amber won her ONE counterclaim because the only evidence the JURY saw was the phone call that IO made to the police. The Jury did not know that another phone call was made prior to IO's call, from Rocky who was at the penthouse. Her winning claim stated, ""...called the cops, and when that didn't work, they roughed the place up, spill a little wine, and CALLED THE COPS AGAIN"". The only evidence the jury had in front of them, was ONE 9-1-1 call. Which also tells me the Jury was paying attention, and trying to do what they felt was right.",0,2022-06-03T21:26:09Z,2022-06-03T21:26:09Z

@eddiek8179,"There's a difference between the UK case and the US one. First of all, the UK case is Depp vs The Sun not Heard who was a witness. The sun won and their win doesn’t prove that Johnny did any of what she claimed. It just proves that they believed what they were reporting and didn’t act with “actual malice”. There’s a lot about the UK that was kind of fishy. He had the evidence. He brought it forward in the US where he was able to. A lot of evidence was not allowed there. They couldn't even cross examine. The judge also should have recused himself because he had ties with lawyers in the case and his son worked for the tabloid and a whole lot more. The judge also believed that Heard donated the 7 million which she didn't. You guys should really research this and not perpetuate misinformation and falsehoods. Depp was a victim and instead, you guys are protecting the actual provable abuser.",0,2022-06-03T21:12:24Z,2022-06-03T21:12:24Z

@idatschichoflos6446,"I would appreciate it if mainstream media would take their role seriously and inform themselves in detail before coming out with their general opinions into which they press the case in question even if it is as absurd as with Amber Heard. I watched many sequences of the trial in full and I took to lawyers' livestreams explaining the legal background as well as their impression of the credibility of witnesses. I found no one on YouTube who the longer the trial went still believed Amber Heard. What I found where dozens of commentaries under every video from DV victims who 98 out of 100 didn't believe Amber Heard and felt enraged about her unconvincing and very inconsistent acting as a victim. The meaning of defamation is that you can proclaim whatever vicious lie you want with the goal of revenge and getting social, material etc. advantages for yourself which decidedly is not the meaning of MeToo.",0,2022-06-03T21:11:34Z,2022-06-03T21:11:34Z

@ashleyrussell9188,"You guys are losing a lot of reasonable minded people out here - we watched you when you went after Trump - because the facts & evidence bore it out in the face of gaslighting - equally we will switch you off when you bring talking heads on who either didn't watch the trial enough to hold a valid opinion, or are blinded by an idea - in the same way Trumpists are. 

Your LH guest is issuing opinion without taking into account all the facts to hand . Additionally, we don't buy your tacit attempt to make this about left/right politically either - many people who you would place in the right wing camp on this trial are in fact very left wing, some are right...it's not political - we started watching this trial  fully on board to take abuse allegations seriously adn ready to consider all the evidence - but Heard's case, and Heard herself, were not supported by credible evidence - and Amber herself on the stand was derided by multiple DV case legal professionals as lacking credibility in almost every regard - making her testimony an act of egregious harm to real victims of DV - putting their case for support back literally decades.

Instead of coming out and blindly defending someone based on their gender - and falling into the very same 'emotion vs facts' paradigm you (rightly) accuse Trumpists and the right wing of - you would better serve yourselves - and your audience - if you stood on the same fact based journalistic platform we started watching you for in the first place.

Same goes for MSNBC - both channels that I've previously regarded as fact based and credible, are frankly making unsupported and ridiculous claims based on emotion. Just stop it - you either stand for facts or you don't.",2,2022-06-03T21:02:37Z,2022-06-03T21:02:37Z

@roses2155,"Ms. Martin clearly is unqualified to comment on this case.  She either didn't watch the trail with all the evidence, testimony, and dynamics surrounding this process OR she doesn't understand the law.  Her apparent thesis is that when someone is defamed, they do not have the right to sue if they are men and/or rich.  Last time I checked, men, regardless of wealth, are citizens on the United States.  

Being a lawyer, Ms. Martin surely is aware that defamation lawsuits and the judicial process, in general, In the UK is substantially different than the US.  Regardless of the Sun Paper defamation case/outcome in London, it has no bearing on what Virginia courts will consider, allow, or deny.   There is a segment of the legal profession that thinks the US should adopt decisions and findings of foreign courts.  These people are known as ""idiots.""

She also seems to think that justice has to comport with an extra-judicial agenda.  Rejecting the facts of the case and rendering a judgement in order to, ""make a statement about abuse"" is wrong.  Not only is it wrong from an ethical standpoint, but it's also actually AGAINST THE LAW!  Ms. Martin may be an attorney, but she is not qualified to be a commentator if her jurisprudential views include endorsing the denial of redress to a United States citizen and passing judgements that violate the law.

Lastly, CNN continues to swirl down the commode with this sort of silliness.  I can't remember the last time CNN actually had talking heads that could articulate the facts, avoid the easy partisan talking point recitation, and offer debates/commentary from folks that are experts, not ideologues.",0,2022-06-03T21:01:05Z,2022-06-03T21:01:05Z

@annbest7453,"I am Disgusted By this attitude that CNN are putting forward,... the evidence was clearly reviewed by a Jury and a decision was made,... How dare they a bunch of reporters think they know better than an appointed Jury who were well and truly saturated with facts during this trial,... I am a woman, and I feel having seen a lot of the evidence during this trial that Amber Heard was Lying, and Johnny Depp was the real victim of abuse... CNN it seems would rather an innocent man remain with his reputation tainted, just because this decision could effect womens rights,... that's Utterly Indefensible and I am appalled...

Did this team actually listen to all the evidence, and the tapes, because I'm finding it hard to believe they're taking this viewpoint if they had seen everything put forward in the trial... 

This is NOT a Major setback for women,... THIS was a Victory for Mis justice for Men and Women who have been wrongfully accused of physical and sexual abuse which is a disgusting thing to be accused of, when you're innocent...The UK court case has a dubious result as Depp was suing the Sun Newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch,... No Jury just a judge, and Who did the Judges son work for,... He worked for Rupert Murdoch,... and there has been many comments about that result ever since it was given,... and I live in the UK and my nephew works for the Met police, so you hear things,... 

Anyway Re the American trial,... the evidence, the tapes everything pointed at Heard Lying,... From listening to the tapes alone, IF you are the victim of domestic abuse YOU DO NOT antagonise, and bitch, and try and create any situation which could then possibly result in you getting hit and assaulted,... You are compliant, and quiet and try to de-escalate any situation where you're potentially going to get hit or worse,... Amber Heard Taunted, Provoked, Ridiculed, Berated and Hit Johnny Depp in these audio tapes, whilst he tried in several of them to walk away and de-escalate the situation,... those tapes in themselves were very telling, and spoke volumes,... as in Amber Heard was the Abuser, not Johnny Depp,...

To accuse someone of not only Physical Abuse, but also Sexual Abuse, is a Wicked, Vindictive, Abhorrent thing to do,... and Amber Heard in my mind is an Evil, Manipulative, Vindictive individual,... To claim to be a Victim when she Isn't, and to use the grief and trauma of real victims to punish a man who had had enough of being beaten and abused and was going to leave her, is Utterly Indefensible,...

@EchanteDante,"SO ARE WE JUST GOING TO IGNORE ALL OF THE FABRICATED EVIDENCE AND LIES??
If women should be angry at anyone it isn’t anyone involved in this trial except Amber Heard. She is the one who set women back when she lied, photoshopped photos, didn’t have a single testimony that that added up or made sense. While every audio recording, every photo, every testimony from Johnny’s side did add up and did make sense and was truthful. 

Why is it so crazy to believe that Amber may be abusive and spiteful enough to want to try to trash Johnny further since she could no longer belittle and abuse him in person so she took to the public knowing abuse allegations would destroy him and get people on her side. BUT SHE DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PUBLIC SEEING THROUGH HER SHOTTY EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY. 

She basically said while on the stand why doesn’t anyone believe me that everyone except me and the people who benefit off of my career? 

I don’t understand how the media can have people on still talking about another powerful man winning and their victim losing and setting women back.

People shouldn’t not believe accusations when they come out however when evidence and information comes out proving that those allegations are in fact not exactly true then WHY WOULD PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THEM?? 

Basically what some of you are arguing is that because she is a woman and only 10% of women lie about abuse we should believe her and all women even when they have been proved to be one of those women who fit into that 10%?? It make NO SENSE!! 

I think anyone who is now thinking all women are liars and that women are just lying about abuse 100% of the time shouldn’t be taken seriously. Of course female victims should be believed!!! But so should Male victims! And when either gender accuser is found to have been lying especially in a courtroom I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SIDE WITH THE PERSON WHO FACED BACKLASH FOR THOSE FALSE CLAIMS.",0,2022-06-03T20:33:07Z,2022-06-03T20:33:07Z

Johnny had the burden of proving beyond all reasonable doubt that Amber maliciously lied about all of her accusations in an attempt to harm him. All she had to do was TELL THE TRUTH! JUST ONCE! She did not produce a shred of proof that she was physically or sexually abused. She accused every single one of Johnny’s witnesses of being liars. She even claimed the police were lying about not seeing injuries on her. She called the TMZ guy a liar when he said the cabinet video came from the source and was edited. She lied about photos that the whole world saw. She’s the type of person to spill a drink right in front of you and claim that it was you. That is why she lost the case.

Johnny Depp did nothing wrong, and Amber Heard completely ruined his life and ripped off part of his finger. Heard has basically no real evidence that Johnny did ANYTHING to hurt her, quite the opposite, he stopped drinking for Heard, while she kept pouring the alcohol down her entitled Neo-Nazi Feminist attitude in front of Johnny while he was trying to stay sober JUST FOR HER! If you've watched the whole trial it's crystal clear that Amber Heard is a master manipulating gold digger whose only purpose in life is to destroy men publicly. The lady defending Heard needs to get a clue or a lobotomy, because clearly she didn't watch the entire trial. I'm so happy to finally seeing men get justice against abusive and manipulative women. It's about damn time the courts start looking at men and women as equals, and not this bullshit of always taking the woman's side. I hope Amber Heard loses everything she's worked for, she's a cruel, cold, calculated, and callous woman who deserves nothing but the worst life has to offer. Finally, men are starting to reject feminism, in the toxic state it's in, and move towards misandry instead. MISANDRY FTW!!!",0,2022-06-03T18:20:30Z,2022-06-03T18:20:30Z

@namkebanyanklariti,"It's not a big win for ""powerful men"" but rather a big win for the truth. Not all reports of domestic violence are true and sometimes women lie. We have seen this happen in false rape allegations made against that black football player whose budding career got ruined only to learn later that she lied about the whole thing. She didn't even return the money she took for the lie and she was not prosecuted for the lie either. This shows you how powerful the gynacrosy is in society. We saw pictures and tapes showing her crying with no apparent tears flowing and lying repeatedly to ruin the good name and character of Depp, yet all these commentaries still prop her up as if she is the poster child for feminism and domestic violence. The jury unanimously spoke with the verdict that they did not believe her and her fakeries. You guys at CNN need to start covering the truth and stop pandering to women viewership, lying to them even when it is proven in a court of law that she lied. She was shown to be mentally disturbed (feces on bed) and violent by her own admission on admissible tape recordings in her own voice. Why is it that when a woman abuses a man and he hits back then the woman aggressor is still given the benefit of the doubt and still seen as the victim? When men assault women in dv situations and the women hit back, the woman is still considered the victim and the man the perp or aggressor. Why the double standard? Why propagate double standards media? A journalism that tells the truth and explores these nuances is credible and worth viewing.  What you have here is trash tabloid, sexist and misandrist coverage of a serious issue of domestic violence and the apparent fault lines in feminist discourses. Your headline wreaks of desperation and lies! Bring back the Muckrakers please! I yearn for objective and common sense journalism.",0,2022-06-03T18:13:21Z,2022-06-03T18:18:02Z

This is a wan who lied about charity money, did jabe the common sense to take pictures of any of her  numerous injuries but took pictures of JD sleeping etc and you want us to believe her bcos she is a woman. Woman cannot chose to be equal to man as and when it suits them. Somebody punches your face with huge  rings on all his fingers and there is no medical records, photos etc. The lady in the interview will be a terrible jury and judge in such a case.  Man are and can also be Domestic Abuse victims. The jury got it right this time and I hope more men came out so the world will know it's not only women. Most of these so called commentators didn't even watch the full trial only clips and want to sound like they know it all. Amber Turd actually dared Johnny to go out to the public see if they would believe him as a domestic abouse victim. She is a horrible person who physically and mentally abused Johnny. Good riddance to all these liars ruining peoples lives.

@heatherkempf9897,"I'm sorry but Amber Heard repeatedly physically abused Johnny Depp, in her own words multiple times on tape, and Amber Heard was not a believable witness, her retelling of her stories' were over the top, performed for the jury, her expressions flickered on and off in a nano second, all of her sobbing without a single tear ever, the creepy way she made her statement turned to the jury instead of replying to the attorney asking her the question, either her own or the opposing side. She was aggressive, haughty, and thoroughly unlikeable. That will never go over well with either a jury or viewer's. She has a past arrest for domestic abuse of her former partner in public, and a video of her hitting her sister in the face. Amber Heard is absolutely an abuser. I was not convinced at all that Johnny Depp ever abused her. Her mountain of evidence was a washout, her photos were proven to be photoshopped by an expert, she was proven not to have PTSD by a forensic psychologist who met with her and studied her in person, as well as all of her record's, and diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. She sounded like a maniacal demon on the one tape where she was taunting and calling Depp name's, etc. She admitted on tapes that she started physical fights with him and he would leave, which really made her mad, she said Oh yes you did the right thing, you are so admirable! You are such a baby Johnny! Grow up!  She slipped up and called her makeup pallet a bruise kit (which could be used to fake bruises, just as easily, more easily than to cover them up actually without professional palettes) and she stated that you put on foundation, then concealer, then the color to counteract the color of the bruise on top. That's not right. If you had blue/purple bruising and used orangey peachy color to counteract it, and put that on top of your foundation and concealer, you would see the orangey peachy color. It would be foundation, color corrector, concealer. The bed damage she showed that she claimed was caused by Depp's boot while assaulting her (and there was a large pocket knife in the bed in the picture) was thoroughly debunked by a lawyer (YouTube Law and Lumber) who is a woodworker in his spare time, the damage could only have been caused by a sharp objects, like a knife, inserted between the grain of the thick slab of wood (nearly an entire tree) an then wedging the knife back and forth to splinter off a piece. A boot could not have caused the damage, a boot likely wouldn't cause any damage at all, the most a blunt object could do was dent the wood and that would take considerable force. That wasn't introduced into the trial, just more evidence that she lied and staged ""evidence"". There were no medical records, ever, and considering her many ""broken noses"", as an actress, that is rather unbelievable. Or being sexually assaulted with a broken whiskey bottle, who wouldn't be going to the ER or at least their gynecologist after that, plus she claimed to have cuts all over her arms and feet. But did not seek any medical attention and this is an aggressive, assertive woman, with no regard for her husband, her many male late night visitor's when Depp was out of town or country and her OpEd proved that, as well as all her photos of him passed out, or sleeping, which she would then text to her friend. The video she was secretly recording of him slamming cabinet's the morning after his mother died and his accountant and attorney had embezzled a great deal of his money, smirking smuggly into the camera at the end. That part was deleted before she gave it to TMZ, yes, a TMZ former employee risking a lawsuit against him by TMZ testified that the edited video was given to TMZ they hold the copywriter and that can only come from the original owner of the video. Just as she slipped up in her deposition for the divorce by admitting that she tipped off TMZ that she was filing for divorce, not what she testified to under oath in this trial. Another lie. The fact that TMZ was tipped off in advance when she filed for the restraining order, that she would stop at a specific spot when leaving the courthouse and they were to capture the bruise on the right cheek. Which was miraculously missing in a paparazzi picture the very next day, outside her lawyer's office remarkably fresh faced (certainly looked like no makeup, not even blush, with NO bruise. I'd say that she lied about everything, the abuse to her, the DONATED money of $7 million dollars to the two charities that she never made but claimed she did on more than one TV show, in the UK defamation trial Depp vs The Daily Mail, and she tried to claim it in this trial. She is a pathological liar. And as a survivor of domestic abuse myself, I can tell you she certainly doesn't act or react like any survivor of domestic abuse I've ever seen or known. She doesn't speak for or represent me. And while I admit that Depp is a talented actor, I'm not one of his fans, I don't follow his career or personal life. But I did follow and watch this trial because it was about DV claim's and defamation. I watched it all and I don't believe her and I didn't believe her ""witnesses' "" whose stories didn't corroborate her's and they never witnessed the abuse. Depp was believable, his expert witnesses' were professional, and concise, and proved her expert's wrong every time and most of her witnesses' did not follow ethical rules of their profession and more than one of them was a complete freakshow. Her lawyer's seemed inept, but when you are serving a client that you know is a liar and fabricated evidence, because if they were doing their job, they knew, there isn't much you can do. And the whole First Amendment, Freedom of Speech, garbage, apparently she believes applies only to her and that her right's have been violated, but doesn't Depp have those same rights? And he is a powerful, wealthy man, blah, blah. It didn't do anything for him in the UK, did it? And here in America people now, automatically believe the woman, and I do believe that when a woman claim's she has been abused, in any way, or a man, they should be taken seriously, but it is innocent until proven guilty. She maliciously publicly twice ruined his name and reputation. But she never filed charges against him, did she?",0,2022-06-03T15:45:53Z,2022-06-03T15:45:53Z

You need to prove that what you said is true ! And the only one I heard and saw in videos and audios insulting and abusing and also admitting hitting someone was Amber Heard ! So that’s why she lost the case ! Because she lie ! And justice has being serve ! She should be hold accountable for her lies ! Because we deserve respect as real DV survivors !! The true is the true ! And not matter how u want to hide the true it will always came out !! She was the real villain ! Everybody testified she was the aggressor and the jealous one for Jhony so career ! She was even so ungrateful that Jhony got her the Aquaman role and this is how she pay him back the favor !! Now she got what she deserve for lying ! And trying to pretend to be a real victim only to get revenge in her ex ! She should if being taking to court by Jhony for abusing him as well !! God is big and he gave the justice to the inocent one ! So fake news stop reporting what you want to brain wash people about what real happen !

Instead, watch the trial for from beginning to end.

She's thankful for doing this because if you listen to legacy media outlets, you'd think the events of the trial were the complete opposite.

@florisPH,"Disgusting. Depp winning is bad because he's a man and Turd losing because she's a woman is unfair apparently. 
What the hell happened to equality? One human abused another human and in this case she's the abuser. General statistics don't make any difference to one single scenario and they certainly don't decide whether she's telling the truth or not.

With the evidence and testimonies provided, which anyone can see, Turd was lying and contradicting herself so many times that no one will believe her anymore. Except those in her gaslit bubble.

Again, absolutely disgusting to discredit the truth and the work put in by the judge, jury and other parties to make this a fair trial to at the end just decline the verdict.

What a bunch of sad, blind, deaf and dumb people you've collected around you, Amber Turd. Perfect for a lying human piece of crap.

@jedheart8059,"Jury stated Amber Heard was defamed May 21st 2016, testimony by police officer by stating Heard trashed the apartment when actually the apartment was cleaned before the police came to check on Amber. She didn't know the police were called. So Johnny made up a story because he thought the police saw what he did, messing up the apartment. Apparently he did not know it had been cleaned and the police never saw it messed up. So Johnny lied. The problem is that the Jury stated Amber committed a hoax while also finding Johnny lied about at least one statement of fact. That means Johny did in fact defame Amber intentionally. It begs the question whether he also lied about other issues. Which given an argument to clarify may win her case the next time.",0,2022-06-03T10:26:31Z,2022-06-03T10:26:31Z

@isairshad5472,"No, a big win for truth and evidence, evidence and credibility won!  Defamation headline of op-ed, which was the focus of defamation trial had allegations of sexual assault and domestic assault, not the verbal insults that came about during course of their arguments.  I think all married couples are guilty of that at some point in relationship, does that mean all wives can come forth and claim domestic assault?!! Women can lie!  what about the proven abuse that Depp suffered by Amber Heard?!  There should be no discrimination regarding which sex or what level of success you have attained, it doesn’t give someone of lower success the right to lie about you!  Lodging lies about someone, proven lies, lies proven by tons of evidence is an abuse of freedom of speech and if half of the people reporting on trial actually watched every
bit of it, like I and most people invested in the truth, they wouldn’t be saying half the shit they are.  The jury used common sense and the evidence at hand and at the end of the day #JusticeforJohnny was served!  I don’t agree with the onslaught of hate for her but had Johnny not fought to have libel trial displayed for public, how would he ever get his truth out to his millions of fans and haters who didn’t know better?!  People did believe Amber initially and did give her the woman the benefit of the doubt, until all the evidence was leaked online and then came this trial, it was not a domestic abuse criminal trial, it was a defamation civil trial, which means that sensitivity of subject be damned if she had no feelings about writing about it in the Post and feeding the Sun in UK grim details of fabricated lies and evidence to gain notoriety and become a spokesperson for the cause, to feed into and publicize her Mera hero complex, for a cause where she was an abuser, why should J feel anyways about publicizing his truth?!! He was the victim here, why are they dismissing that, because he is a man?!  CNN is very out of touch on this subject, and their commentary is useless.  I don’t believe it sets back women’s rights, it sets the stage for equal rights for all abused victims which is what it should have been to start with.  Women and people of colour, and different religions always face persecution and discrimination, unfortunately that’s the ignorance of the world, being abused and coming forward will always be hard for the abused person.  Johnny would never have told his story, had Amber not played the victim card and recklessly slander him to the world.  Men deserve the same rights when it comes to abuse.

Yes, this is win for a powerful people's men, a man who is victim/survivor of D.V, false allegations, defamation of character. He is powerful because of his innocent, his honesty, truth, good heart. He is powerful because he spoke against Domestic violence, violence, assault, injustice and he seek justice for all victims of D.V. He is powerful man because he is people's men. Amber doesnt represent us all women and victims of D.V. Still this people are calling her Victim and Johnny just to be powerful man is pathetic, disgusting and horrible. Johnny is victim of D.V.

Also, how can you be so sure she doesnt belong to the less than 10% of women who lie about domestic violence? I am a feminist, so i naturally believe women who bravely comes out from hiding.

@TimothyHuffGuitar,"This lady (Areva) is a women siding metoo nutjob. I don't think she did anymore than get trial highlights. I believe it would be nearly impossible for ANYONE who watched the trial even halfway to not see that Amber Heard was the instigator and the fueling abuser in the relationship. 
""I didn't punch you Johnny...I didn't lay into you...I hit you!!! You're a baby Johnny...you're such a baby!!! What are you gonna do Johnny...you gonna tell? Go ahead Johnny, tell the world...that *I Johnny Depp am a victim of domestic abuse*""
Her attitude throughout the trial, the tone of her voice in the recordings...Amber Heard is a VERY TOXIC ABUSIVE WOMEN!
I will say that Johnny was partially guilty in that he stayed in the relationship knowing it was toxic. She was far too young for him anyway and vastly less mature. Also Johnny really should have gotten help for his drug and alcohol addiction. 
Many videos were staged up by Amber and she fanned the fire. Like when Johnny came home from the hospital when he thought his mom was dying and he was raging against inanimate objects out of frustration and that little bitch used that incident as ""evidence"" that he was violent!",0,2022-06-03T01:45:26Z,2022-06-03T01:49:50Z

@angellayaright9009,"Where the hell did you find that first speaker? She clearly hasn't done her homework on the UK trial. The UK trial was a joke. And much of the evidence wasn't even allowed in. He never got to really speak to the abuse he suffered or plead his case. And Amber wasn't even the defendant in that case. She also obviously hasn't watched the trial or she would never say that crap. She also shows what kind of person when she is when she says 'less than 10% of women lie about being abused'. So we should just allow those 10% to ruin men's lives? Just so that other women still feel comfortable coming forward? Which btw is a cop out. This won't stop true abuse victims from coming forward. But hopefully it will make those 10% she talks about think twice. 

You also make this sound like it was a draw. That they both were equally found defamatory. Untrue. The jury just thought one statement Johnny's lawyer made about one of the instances was not true. When he had claimed she and her friends staged the house to look like there was abuse when the first set of officers didn't find any sign of domestic abuse. Then called the police back. Though IMO the lawyer had every reason to believe his statement was true considering how much other 'evidence' she fabricated and the number of times she had already lied. So I don't think there was any malice. I think the lawyer honestly believed they had staged that scene too. But regardless, on the other hand, the jury flat out said Depp was not an abuser and she was lying about being abused. They also did not find it defamation that Depp's lawyer had also said it was a hoax. Yet you make it sound like they were both found equally wrong. Bull!

This was a giant win for Depp. He proved she was the abuser, not him. Why the hell are main stream media trying to spin this as if they were both found equally culpable? That was CLEARLY not the case. Holy spin. Lost respect for CNN on this one. What news organizations won't do to save face after helping destroy a man by calling him an abuser even after audio and video were released showing Depp was the one abused.  And now stacking this interview with idiots that are clearly biased. I think this has finally pushed me over to the 'hate main stream media' side. No freaking integrity. None.

Isn't it mind blowing how much these leftist ""woke"" advocates will twist facts and details to fit whatever narrative they are pushing that day.  
This actually gives more victims of dv/ipv, male victims can now feel more able to come forward and get the help they need. 
I hope Johnny pushes for a charity that helps male victims of dv get shelter and protection and help, just like female victims do. We don't even know the true number of male victims out there because even admitting to being physically abused will absolutely get you further shamed and humiliated.

AMBER HEARD and AMBER HEARD ALONE is responsible for any set backs female victimsight have to face iim light of this trial. All though I fail to see how a male victim finding justice for his abuse means female victims will now no longer be believed or helped when they are abused. Unless they to are lieing and were in fact the abuser. Just don't collect evidence trike Amber, see a Dr if your bleeding from your genitals. If there is blood evidence from an attack, make sure to photograph that as well as the other evidence. Don't photograph everything BUT the REAL evidence that PROVES an assault, almost immediatley, like alleged blood splatter evidence on bed sheets. Amber said she was attacked so roughly in a sexual assault that the bed was covered in blood. You know the incident she claimed to of happened and she showed a picture of a footboard with a piece of it's wood jimmied off with a knife, (boot couldn't have done the damage she was claiming tho), but she failed to take pictures of the bloody sheets while she was photographing the foot board. Mor did she collect and stash those sheets, covered in her blood, as evidence either.

@Deus_Imperator,"Where is the video that this is actually a big win for women everywhere?  Can anyone imagine what might have happened if amber heard had gotten away with her lies?  You think women are not believed now?  What do you think would happen then?  

Why does cnn continue to report this verdict as some miscarriage of justice?  Is it that hard to admit that a famous woman actually lied and betrayed women everywhere?  That she conned and manipulated millions?  There were no mountains of evidence in her favour. She had nothing but inconsistencies, debunked lies, and antithetical behaviour. No receipts. No records. Exaggerations. And lies. She tried to play the jury but they saw right through it. Its time to admit she played you too, if youre a supporter. 

Millions of men AND WOMEN all over the world are rejoicing she lost because it secured the dignity of abused men AND WOMEN everywhere. 

Good grief some people just cant step away from the abuse narrative. 

Amber Heard is the equivalent of the woman years back who claimed she was at the WTC when it fell and tried to get sympathy. Shes the military's ""stolen honor"" who tries to be a veteran when she isnt. 

She was the spokeswoman for abuse. Do you not understand why having a woman who pretends to be abused occupying that position damages a woman's credibility when she makes an abuse claim?  The creed is ""always listen"" when a woman claims abuse. It is not ""always blindly believe no matter the evidence."" She was listened to for six years and now everyone knows the truth.

@frayjajjarian5015,"I have never been more disappointed in Areva Martin 

1. The UK case was heard by a judge that is a relative of the party involved - now that this case has ended the correct way Mr. Depp could go back to the UK and have the case reheard by a non corrupt Judge. 

2. In this case Miss Heard who recorded everything never once recorded a single abuse event and her photos don't fit - police video's show she is lying and her rape with a bottle story is just not medically possible to walk away from. If you listen to her words you will figure out what she is claiming or should I say how.  You also have to believe that he did that while holing her down with a severed finger. Along with all the evidence that did not match her lies. 

3. As a person who has been abused I don't believe her at all - she is the abuser and that shows in court the Jury made the right call. 

4. As for the statement that this sets back women being believed - Miss Heard did that when she lied repeatedly SHE GAVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO SAY SEE WOMEN LIE!

5. Mr. Depp's win in this is a victory for every woman, man & child that has tried to get help and was called a liar. He has given us our voices back.",0,2022-06-02T20:11:06Z,2022-06-02T20:11:06Z

@katiedaniels3997,"Mountain of evidence?  Check your facts.  Did you even watch the case? Looks like this person is just repeating what Heard's lawyer said in a 5 minute interview. Heard was proven to have repeatedly lied, even exposing it herself.  Such as when she claims she never wrote the op-ed, then when she was trying to defend another lie, she blurts out "" That's why I wrote the op-ed!"" Like when she declared J Depp severely assaulted her sexually and repeatedly punched her in the face and yet she was able to go on to a talk show the next day laughing and being very animated showing no signs of swelling or bruising.  She also did not seek medical attention for her severe sexual assault.  Many witnesses such as her hair dresser saying she saw nothing, no bruises, no swelling.  Heard claims she used ice packs and covered up with make up but any doctor can refute that and tell you that it can take weeks to recover from a facial assault. Impossible to cover up swelling with make up.  Plus it is very painful, yet on that talk show she is laughing and showing no signs of pain. Not to forget her sliced up feet from walking on the broken glass. She was photographed the next day laughing and walking down the street with her friend Rocky and her husband Josh looking very happy. Not something someone that had just been severely beaten and sexually assaulted would do. Her slip up when she had previously passionately denied having told TMZ about her going to get the protection order against J Depp then saying when they told TMZ so they would be there for the photo op.  Lie after lie after lie and people are defending her.

On the other hand, great point at the very end about the second statement that AH actually won. I've heard several people in the media say it's inconsistent with the verdict that JD was defamed. No, it isn't.

@onceuponadime978,"Not every woman crying abuse is honest. It's a loss for amber heard not ""women everywhere"" its a little rediculous that we just automatically believe all women or else ur a sexist. I mean people lie women included, and you can't say that when one is found to be a liar it sets all women back,  I mean I watched a lot of that trial and amber heard was totally unconvincing. I'm not a fan of either one so I'm about as impartial a person about it you'll find, we have this mentality now that we have to believe all women even when it's a liar and screw the man and what damage it does to him. I mean you talk about setting women back what about setting men back? I mean depp came out as an abuse victim but we r supposed to ignore that? Despite the fact that abused men are even less likely to come forward as women who are? I mean I just can't get on board with this kind of thinking.  I mean I look at each case individually, these blanket statements are a) not how people work and b) ignore any facts that are present. The woman is always right and to be believed and the man is always wrong and to be despised no matter what? I mean that's basically what this lady on here is advocating for and it's not right. All that does is divide society further than it already is. 

Not believing amber heard does not set all women back. Stop being so melodramatic. Language like that suggests it's improper for any outcome in court regardless of anything except the best pne for the woman and worst one for the man, and I've been victim to that kind of thinking personally and i think it's not only moronic but its a lie too.",0,2022-06-02T18:50:13Z,2022-06-02T18:50:13Z

Isn't it clear that if you send bullets, they will start killing, and if there are a lot of bullets, then there will be even more murders and the conflict will drag on even longer. It's simple logic. If you want to help Ukraine, send food and medical aid, but not weapons. At the beginning of the operation, Russia destroyed only a couple of warehouses, and the rest of the destruction was only from weapons sent from the United States to Ukraine. Peace is when there are no weapons, not when you ship tons of them. From which I conclude that the United States in Ukraine only needs the blood and death of Ukrainians otherwise they would not have sent weapons.",0,2022-06-02T18:36:56Z,2022-06-02T18:36:56Z

It is not the Ukrainian army that is fighting in Ukraine, but specially trained terrorist detachments led by Zelensky! These terrorists were trained for 8 years in special camps, for example, one of the camps was in Mariupol. The fact that the news says about Mariupol that Russia destroyed it is a lie, Russia destroyed the training base of the Azov terrorists. The news is lying to you.

Also no victim should go around telling the public their story.  She should tell the police and her lawyer and that's just about it.  You can never tell the full exact story about any complicated relationship, and you cannot present the other persons facts either, so whatever you say in public will be not fair or complete.  So she intentionally went to the public to ASSAULT his reputation.  And also to the title, In case you have not been watching only above average wealth people succeed in any legal environment.

@waspfan6072,"DEAR CNN - Can men not be victims of abuse?  There are men who are abused everyday and the embarrassment and shame keep them from coming forward.   There are many men who were taught to never raise their hand to a female, who were taught it is their job to provide and protect their family.  When they find themselves in abusive relationships, they find themselves alone and isolated.  And one of the reasons for this is how the media immediately sides with the woman.  In this case, there was plenty of evidence showing Amber Heard was verbally and physically abusive to Johnny Depp.  Yet, Areva Martin is allowed to come on and say this is a big win for powerful men.  This was not a win for powerful men, this was a win for abused men.  As Areva put it, statistically, less than 10% of women lie about sexual abuse... so does that mean when a woman does lie about sexual abuse that those -10% of men get punished for the good of all women?  Do they deserve to have their reputation, careers, and personal lives ruined?  I generally find your network fair and balanced, but not in this case.  A jury of seven people, who heard and saw all the evidence found that Amber Heard was untruthful.  That she did not suffer the claims she made.  That Johnny Depp had everything taken from him, from someone he had loved, who not only mistreated him, but then used him as a springboard in the #MeeToo era to advance her station in life.  Areva should not be upset that Johnny Depp won, she should be upset that Amber Heard's lies and manipulation has potentially cast a shadow of doubt on women who actually suffer domestic abuse and want to come forward.  That is not on Johnny Depp, that is on Amber Heard and every network and publication that gave power to her lies.  Promoted her lies, sold copy on her lies, gained ratings on her lies.  You don't have the right say the outcome was wrong, what you have the right to do now is apologize for being part of the problem.  You judged and sentenced Johnny Depp before the truth was known, and now you should make it right.",0,2022-06-02T18:26:31Z,2022-06-02T18:26:31Z

Also, the ""powerful men"" narrative that the Heard team is desperately pushing is really stupid. Depp was NOTHING going into the trial, he was an actor with no acting gigs or contracts, money problems, and a labelled ""wife beating rapist"". Yeah, he's so powerful his career was nuked by a single statement made by a ""powerless woman"". The real problem for Heard's team is that people saw both sides of the story for the first time.

It's funny that the lady said that 10% of women that claim to be abused are lying. Well AH is clearly part of that 10%. I'm not sure why they can't see that. This isn't about men or women, this is about people that are falsely accused of abuse coming forward and doing something about it. Maybe the media should focus on that. Stop making this about the sex of the victim and make it about domestic abuse as a whole.

Johnny’s lead lawyer was a woman and so was Ambers. The judge was a woman and there were women in the jury as well. This trial was about the truth and had nothing to do with women.

@Andre-nd6nk,"the UK trial was a sham. The Judge, Andrew Nichol is intimately connected with Dan Wootton, The Sun’s journalist who posted the defamatory allegation that JD was a “wife beater”. The connection is through the Judge’s own son, Robert N Palmer, who works alongside Wootton at TalkRadio, part of the same group owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Wootton, is a journalist and broadcaster from New Zealand, an executive editor of The Sun newspaper and a regular host of TalkRadio’s drivetime show. An incestuous conflict of interest, putting it mildly. Why, knowing of this conflict did Mr Justice Nichol preside over the case we ask? Why, in such a high profile case did the Lord Chief Justice allow Mr Justice Nichol to preside over the case, when any other judge could have done so?

They can win against an abuser that everyone believed just because she made it her mission to ride this tragedy's coat tails to big fame. The jury made the right call in every respect. Defamation and abuse were proven to a jury that had to unanimously agree. That's how compelling the evidence was. In the UK trial a lot of the evidence wasn't available or analyzed properly.

@michaelutech4786,"""inconsitency ... on one hand this is a hoax ... on the other hand [this is also defamation]"" - That's not inconsistent at all.

The statement that the jury considered defamatory was that Amber and her friends fabricated evidence on one specific occasion.

AH showed that the two calls to the cops were made before the first cops arrived, so that Waltman statement was not true, they couldn't have known that the cops arriving first would not find evidence. That does not mean that there was no deception on Amber's side or that her claims were true.

But this is really a reference to a specific incidence, whereas other Waltman statements had a wider scope concerning the entirety or larger parts of Ambers claims. The jury agreed that these claims were a hoax and that does by no means contradict their finding on the specific incidence and how Waltman characterised it.",0,2022-06-02T15:43:45Z,2022-06-02T15:43:45Z

@tonkinbray,"This is making me angry now, did the media not watch the same court case as the rest of the world? All her 'evidence' had no credibility when placed under scrutiny. JD was never criminally convicted of anything. It was EXTREMELY clear in the trial that their relationship was violent and volatile. But this was not abuse. The uk trial was not the same case as this one. JD sued the sun newspaper not amber. There were different stipulations and as Amber wasn't the defendant her testimony and evidence wasn't as scrutinised. Also there was 'mountains' of evidence that JD couldn't use. Also the UK judge believed that AH had donated her divorce settlement, which has later shown to be false. This case definitively PROVED she lied, therefore the media needs to stop calling her the victim. I wish no ill will towards Amber,  I hope she finds peace and focuses on her own family. But the media needs to change their language and stop siding with her, everyone saw the trial. She WAS NOT CREDIBLE, her evidence was NOT CREDIBLE. She clearly LIED or at the very least exaggerated. The both abused substances, were volatile and violent. I actually think JD was the one physically hurt more than AH. He seemed to hit out on objects and AH hit him.

@michaelutech4786,"""the heading ... may have affected ... just sexual abuse"" - There were three statements from the op-ed that were up to the jury to evaluate. What the judge decided was that these three statement are the focus of the jury, but at the base of all three statements were all the detailed allegations from AH. They have not been ignored. Her lawyers got the opportunity to define the meaning of this verdict from AH perspective and they abused this to mislead the jury into making this a case for free speech.

Making this a case of free speech, were Amber appears to be an American hero defending the first amendment, at the same time her counter claim attacks the first amendment exactly the same way as she claims JD did and she actually succeeded in defeating the right the pretended to protect by succeeding in one case of her counterclaim.

Not only does the first amendment not apply to private interactions, she immediately contradicts herself by asking the jury to grant her the right to violate the constitution - if that was a violation.

This is why this verdict was exactly the right and the best thing the jury could have done. She deserved to loose because she abused the public, she abused victims of abuse and she tried and failed to abuse the court. And after all, she might very well have abused JD.

@michaelutech4786,"""Obviously JD can afford..."" - The guy has a valid case, in the USA, success in a legal contest is at least as much a function of your wealth as it is one of truth. But that is not specific to cases of domestic abuse, this is a problem at the core of this society. There is no partial solution for cases of domestic abuse and there should not be. Either the rule of law is about justice or it is about a darwinistic advantage. That's up for Americans to decide.

In this case, wealth was not an issue. AH had millions to spend. Not her own property, she decided to spend the money she pledged and pretended to have donated to children to defend herself. And she did not divert the money from these charities to defend herself, she diverted it from them to keep it. We know that now.

There are much better examples for people failing to preserve their legal status because they can't pay for it facing an overwhelming financial force. You can find these cases in every court room every day. No need to wait for this cinematic case.",0,2022-06-02T14:51:09Z,2022-06-02T14:51:09Z

@michaelutech4786,"""I think it is another big win for powerful men"" - The judge in the UK found the allegations credible, the jury in the USA did not. The public opinion did not find them credible.

So as far as the USA as a society is concerned, there is a broad consensus that the allegations are not true. Should the verdict in the UK then supersede that in the USA? I don't see why.

The jury did not see the mountain of evidence. There is no evidence that objectively proves either side. There is actually very little evidence that AH actually incurred any physical injury that raises to the level that we understand as a result of domestic violence. The evidence presented by AH was contradicted by contemporary evidence, neither of these are conclusive which at least leaves quite some doubt. 

""They could have found that even one instance of abuse occured"" - They could have, but they didn't have to, because there was no conclusive evidence. The problem is that as soon as AH is caught in an obvious lie, the case of her donnations is such an example, her evidence is considerably less reliable.

""To believe that AH made all this up"" - That is exactly what happens if you make a number of allegations, if you claim to be a model case but then get caught in one false allegation. If she had conclusive proof, of if she just was a victim, then she had no reason to make up anything. The price for making up allegations and getting caught is a loss of credibility. It is like that and it should be like that.

This lady is giving the opponents of the me-too movement exactly the argument they are looking for. This argument is that you cannot ""believe women"" if believing women would mean that ""you cannot believe men"".

In a situation were powerful men can take advantage of women and do not have to fear repercussions, women in deed need protection. But they don't need protection because they are women, they need protection because they are and especially if they are victims. Part of why they are victims is because they are weaker in that situation. But not every women is weaker than every man. Power is also not only about physical strength or money. Public opinion and awareness can be power and this power can be abuses just as any other power. Amber Heart apparently and now officially abused the power of public opinion and the me-too movement.

There is no way around the need to evaluate evidence. If ever we accept that the evaluation of truth is a function of gender or any other static attribute, then the rule of law degrades to become a privilege. The rule of law is corrupted to some degree, that is why men in power often have it so easy to get it their way. That is why corruption needs to be opposed and fought. We still see the problem, because nobody fights this corruption effectively.

We have to believe women, if we can. AH does not have to be believed, because we just cannot believe her as a result of her deceptions. She did not loose this trial because she is a woman, she lost it because she is not trust worthy as a result of objectively verifiable lies.

If the me-too movement experiences damages, it's not a result of the verdict. A different verdict would not have changed the public opinion that in the end decides the outcome. These damages would be a result of AH actions.

Areva Martin damages the cause of the me-too movement just as much as AH did. She proposes to take the UK verdict as more important than both the US verdict and the public opinion. The goal of the me-too movement must be to create awareness of the corruption and to compensate for this corruption by leaning more credibility to victims of abuse. But you cannot be absolutely credible just because you are a women, and Amber Heard provided proof for that. She is a woman, she claims to be a victim, she lied, she got caught. If the me-too movement sides with Amber Heard, the me-too movement would loose its credibility and it would fail to protect victims.

How can someone practice as an attorney who has such an invalid view of justice? How can you be guilty because you are a man? Why would you falsely claim that there is objective evidence, even though it's both obvious that this evidence is not only not conclusive but not even believable, by a jury, by a gigantic margin of public opinion?

Amber does not have 49.9% of support for her credibility. She might have less than 1%.",1,2022-06-02T14:45:34Z,2022-06-02T14:45:34Z

@JoshDennyAltAccount,"This is ridiculous. She’s making this more about the issue of domestic violence in general rather than this specific case. There were several differences in the UK and US trial which this “expert” obviously didn’t consider such as the fact that a majority of Johnny’s testimony was thrown out because he was allegedly on substances, a lot of testimony and evidence didn’t come out, and the fact that she said she was going to donate money in the previous trial (which gained her favorability) vs this trial where it was proven that she didn’t actually donate the money. The only set back is to not follow the evidence and just blindly give the verdict based on the MeToo Movement. Innocent until PROVEN GUILTY. Stop throwing around statistics and look at the facts of this specific case; she lost so much credibility throughout the trial and there were numerous holes poked in her testimony.",0,2022-06-02T14:14:17Z,2022-06-02T14:14:17Z

@sanjd6882,"I am astonished by Areva referring to 'mountains' of evidence in Heard's favour. There were duplicate photos presented as originals, a facial bruise outside the courthouse that mysteriously vanished the next day, the TMZ leak that was implausibly denied, allegations regarding regular use of a 'bruise kit' that was not at that time commercially available, testimony from Heard and her sister that was contradictory about the staircase incident, and a lack of any medical corroboration of her injuries. And of course there WERE audios of Heard admitting to physical abuse, something she also admitted to in court, whilst her aggressive belittling of Depp was utterly inconsistent with the battered, terrified woman she sought to portray. Disappointing from Areva but not surprising when she quotes statistics about only 10% of women lying about DV, and 1 in 3 women being subjected to it as if that's meaningful. Here's another take on those numbers: some women DO lie and two thirds of women are NOT abused. Based on what I've heard this past many weeks, my money is on Heard falling into these latter groups and the jury having reached the right decision.",0,2022-06-02T14:12:58Z,2022-06-02T14:15:49Z

I am shocked at these reactions. Did Jake Tapper, Areva Martin and Renator Mariotti watch the trial? 
How Amber Heard lied under oath during the first and second time on the stand was cringe-worthy!
Come on, @CNN, you can do better than this? I've never believed that you put fake news out there, but THIS? 
So instead, if you're not entirely informed about a case or situation, DON'T REPORT ON IT. If you have to report on it, find better-informed experts for the discussion!
I NEVER thought I'd watch a Fox News (with Sean Hannity, no less!?) session (Hannity: The Heard-Depp circus is finally over) and find their reporting more accurate.

Yes, we should be sensitive towards people who are TRUE victims, because of the fact that they have trauma and it's hard enough for them to come out and tell their story. They should be protected. They should be believed. Nobody who is commenting in this channel believes otherwise. And certainly people WERE on Amber Heard's side before all of this.  However, Amber's story began to fall apart at the evidence. She presented photoshopped pictures as evidence and tried to pretend these were taken in ""different lighting,"" which is just an insult to the intelligence of the American people and the jury. She was caught in her big lie on the stand about donating her entire divorce settlement to charitable funds and ""wanting nothing""  turned out to be total garbage. The ""mountain of evidence"" was clearly just a bunch of lies. The Jury got this right. If we are going to live in a society that wants to make room for true domestic violence abusers, those who plan on trying to use this system and shift in cultural thinking to their advantage should feel the full wrath of our culture to disincentivize people from making up lies in order to try and obtain large divorce settlements and promote their careers.

Idk if it's true, because I didn't watch the verdict, but I have read that the jury  ruled that they believe he  did abuse her (I'm going to have to watch it) which if so makes even less sense he won his defamation lawsuit against her.

Thank you Jesus for  keeping Queen Elizabeth in good health 🙏🏿🙏🏿
Long live the  King  Queen Elizabeth,and the royal family,,
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
They will save us in the future  times if  any great danger like covid 19 from Asia,,,
We must keep our Royal family heritage ( Queen Elizabeth and the power of Bughiham palace  and King of great Britain, British empire,,)
Joe Biden is a good doctor for CHRISTIANS during the times of pandemic troubles,,(  Joe Biden is a covid-19 specialist,)
He said a great cure ( prescribed an oinment, soothing. Courage ,,) for coronavirus diseases and that is Psalm 30:-5
There is a verse about ,,,a good sacricial life ,or duty of a man for family and God's kingdom,,,
Matthew 19:12, which could be translated as follows: 'For so: some are incapable of marriage from birth, some have been converted into it by men and some have made themselves as such for the sake of the kingdom of heaven
I am a protestant man but I found ,,
We need nuns and fathers to do good works 
,,they sacrifice their marriage life for God,,,,
And God needs them in service and worship of God ,,
,, because as a family member you can not do it ,, it's very difficult,,,,
We need a higher authority like President of America,,
Different body parts for different works ,,
1 Peter 4:- the full chapter gives us what our principles in our life ,,,( philippines chapter 1 says paul never feared for death in his past as well as now ,,a sword in our hand death is only a gain and if we live or  he wants to live for church,, otherwise death he likes ,,)
Peter 4:-1,and 2, verses says is accept persecutions ( sufferings body ,,),,
But in some places we get psychological insults,,( both sufferings  in body and psychological insults are the same ,,),,,
We try to get rid 😂😂😂 of it ( sufferings in body,,)
And we want to FORGET 😁😁😁 the psychological insults,,,
But here we need to remember a Comfort  verse of psalm,, distress lasts in night but rejoice in the morning,,,
So in all our sufferings we must take it as ,,it is 1 Peter 4,;:-1 and 2
But God will help you forget the INSULTS bear the sufferings of body , and rejoice in the dawn ,,
Philippines chapter 4  and  Peter 4 
paul says to us to do good even though you are very sick
Medicines and ointments are ,,,
1)◄ Philippians 4:8 
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
2)Psalm 30:-5
weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
But Peter 4 says ,we must try do to good even if enemies or our family members or the church has cut all your legs ,,
You must do good work,duty ,, at least by crawling 😁😁😁

God bless East india company,,
 slaveries are  existing in the world ,, even today,,But ,😁😁😁
There was a cruel SLAVERY existed in the city of asam india,,,land Lords were powerful ,, when the land lord was died they buried him with all costly materials that  he used and also all his servants buried along with him alive 😁😁😁 😁 British and East India company  abolished this evil SLAVERY in india in east india company rule by a special law God bless uk
The ""breast tax"" (mulakkaram or mula-karam in Malayalam) was a head tax imposed on the Nadars, Ezhavars and lower caste communities by the Kingdom of Kingdom of Tranvancore (in present-day Kerala state of India).[1][web 1][web 2][note 1] They were expected to pay the tax when they became laborers, about the age of fourteen.[8][note 5] The lower caste men had to pay a similar tax, called tala-karam, ""moustache tax,"" independent from their wealth or income.[5]
British india abolished this evil SLAVERY ,,God bless East India company British rule ❤️ abolished many cruel  slaveries that existed  in Tamil Nadu india 🙏🙏🙏🙏  for example,,in the year 1934 a British collector issued  1,.2 million agriculture lands to socially untouchable people ,,One needs to go back a hundred years to understand what was owed to the community, that gave a ray of hope, only to be snatched away abruptly. In 1892, J.H.A. Tremenheere, the British District Collector of Chengalpattu , submitted his extensive report on living conditions of Paraiyars (a caste under Scheduled Castes) titled “Notes on the Pariahs of Chingleput”.1 The report carried detailed studies of the deprivation that the community was living through, and ended with policy recommendations to the government in Madras Presidency in order to improve their living conditions. One of it was to give plots of ‘waste’ lands to the Depressed Classes, including Dalits.
In September 1892, the Madras Presidency passed the orders to assign plots conditionally to members of the community. Conditions dictated that these plots could not be transferred to any person who is not a member of Scheduled Castes through sale, gift, mortgage or lease. It is said that up until 1934, land in the order of 1.2 million acres was assigned to members of the community and such plots are known as Panchami Land. In particular, Panchama means the fifth, which can be taken to refer to the the place attributed to ‘Untouchables’ outside the varna system. Hence, the land for Panchamas was named Panchami.
Thank you Jesus for East India company 🙏🙏👍👍👍
The social structure of caste in India is rooted in the Varna system which segregates the Hindu society hierarchically into four Varnas namely, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. The Panchamars or “untouchables” (present day Dalits) are placed below the category of Shudras and exist outside the four fold Varna system. The ideology of caste is based on the notions of purity and pollution. The Panchamars1 were considered the lowest in the society and apart from serving the upper caste landlords they were assigned common duties like removing dead cattle, cleaning drainage, and played a pivotal role in death and funeral ceremonies. Due to the nature of their work they were considered “untouchables” and lived in the fringes of the village. Denied access to mainstream society, their very sight was believed to cause pollution. “Untouchables” were expected to tie an earthen pot round their neck so that their sputum did not fall to the ground and pollute the,,, agriculture lands to these people are to help them live with respect and DIGNITY 
🙏🙏🙏👍it is quiet marvellous to understand that the earth is rotating and we are living in it ,,
Human race ,animals , female or male ,death or life tells us that God is immortal,,❤️❤️
We can believe God,,and we must fear Him 
We all must try do good  works as East India company or British empire ❤️ did  🙏🙏👍🙏God bless you 🙏 amen
God bless President Joe BIDEN
God bless prime minister boris johnson ❤️
When you keep a stethoscope on your chest and check your heart beat or lungs function,,and if  you find it sounds bad function,,
""Do not be afraid then ""
But say rejoice in your heart ,thank God ,,our time to meet lord Jesus is very close ,,
Rejoice ,,
We have no FEAR of death ,,says apostle Paul 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Final results or end of any opposition or attacks from the world or Gentiles is death ,,,
But we must be sure ,,
All our hairs are numbered,,
Not even a pigeon falls on the ground without the will of father,,

Her testimony was the tell of way too many women in this world, but not hers. Many of her statements were debunked by impartial witnesses. More subjectively, her lack of credibility on the stand was outstanding,  and even the doctored photos she submitted as evidence did not add up with the awful accounts of abuse she declared being subjected to.

@pigfacecanshop1691,"SHOCKING TO HEAR that people, especially the experts, are still using the female gender as a winning tool in an abuse case. Isnt Don’t evidence count? Whatever Amber said in detailed or not, that are all hearsay, isn’t it? Where are the evidence? Stop talking about setting women or abused victims back. Liars and manipulators are the ones we are watching out for, regardless of race and gender. Did Johnny Depp ask the millions of supporters to wait outside court, post on social media? Or did he ask the celebrities to support him? Did he fake those audio recordings of Amber’s vile actions? No, no, no. Amber doesn’t represent any women nor any abused victims. She is herself, in true form, in the court and working in the film industry, all under our eyes. People know and people can assess. Therefore stop saying Amber is a representative of woman, it makes me sick.

B- the judge's Son can be tide to the news outlet,  in the US that could be seen as  conflict of interest...
C- the Judge didnt allowed many evidence, and testimony's on Depp's side, basically took miss Heards words at face value, wich is ABSURD, considering in the court procedure here, we witnessed how mister Depp testify and had witnesses and evidence to support his case, Heard had mostly only her word...
dont get me started on the altered photos, the photo that was admitted twice for two different occasions..
the slip up with the bruise kitt, the severed finger, the audio recordings, the cut video sent to TMZ which she says wasnt sent by her , but was taken with her phone, so it was either her or she shared it to a person she knows, and that person did send it... 
and all the witnesses, based on her version (but did not say it, cuz that's liable) apparently perjured themselves by lying to the court..
i dont know this Areva Martin lawyer/person, but i think she watched an alternate reality version of what we got to see for the last few weeks..

Fortunately for society, the general public are able to know a lie when they see it laid out bare in front of them. This is not a blow to women, it is a blow to the biased MSM. It is a blow to ALL false accusers regardless of their sex. 

Man or woman, if you abuse someone, you will be found guilty by your peers in a court of law. The MSM do not have the right to ambush the truth and spin the facts to suit their own agenda (as in this very one sided report).",0,2022-06-02T11:23:01Z,2022-06-02T11:23:01Z

These panelists assert we must automatically believe a woman. But not give the same benefit of the doubt to a man, therefore gender bias, smh.The liberal media's coverage on this case has now assured me the left media CANNOT be trusted to report the facts of a case in an objective manner.

They are completely missing the point that the person who actually let these women down is Amber Heard who misappropriated their experience by claiming wildly outlandish sexual violence, simply in an effort to raise her profile.  If you watched the whole trial you will be in no doubt that she was not subject to physical or sexual violence at the hands of Mr Depp. Yes their relationship was toxic and some of his behaviour was abusive but that is not what she claimed. She claimed horrific sexual violence for which she presented no evidence other than her testimony and for which there was quite a lot of evidence to the contrary. Also, it is wrong to claim that the UK trial found the Sun was correct in calling Mr Depp a wife beater. It was actually found that the Sun had not defamed him because they had believed it to be true based on the fact that they had a source - Ms Heard - who has since  been shown to have a scant relationship with the truth.

@margaretbongiovanni8424,"Avera Martin is an attorney and should know better. That “mountain of evidence” was nothing more than a slag heap of unsupported allegations. No matter how important it is to remember that 90% of DV/SV/DA/SA victims tell the truth, it’s critically important to acknowledge that 10% lie about it. The setback to women’s (or to victims of any gender) believability is in claiming that a jury who sifted all the evidence presented at the trial was wrong in determining that Ms. Heard belonged in that 10% category. 

I’m curious about how much of the trial Ms. Martin actually saw. 

First there were expert witnesses called by both sides. Mr. Depp’s experts were clear, concise, and presented their findings backed by specific data and their conclusions by applying that data. Ms. Heard’s experts were all rather bombastic, expecting the jury to believe them purely on the strength of their reputations without offering much in the way of supporting data. More than one were insulted by Mr. Depp’s lawyers poking holes in their testimony and became overtly hostile. 

Then witness after witness, including Ms Heard’s home visit nurse, her treating physician, and four LAPD officers who answered the 911 call testified that she had no visible bruises or swelling. There were no medical records at all to confirm any physical damage of any kind throughout the entire marriage. In fact, after describing horrific acts of being punched over and over with hands armored in multiple heavy rings, being held by the neck against a wall, being raped with a broken bottle, experiencing excruciating pain, and detailing the minutiae of the environment at the time, Ms. Heard claimed that there were no such records because “she didn’t need medical attention.”  And still, no one saw any bruises. That is, until she filed her TRO and invited TMZ to come film them but denied knowing that they were there. 

Finally, and to me the most pertinent testimony regarding Ms. Heard’s relationship with the concept of truth, were the two witnesses towards the end of the trial who never expected to tell their experience in front of the jury. The first was an ex-TMZ employee who was in charge of dispatching paparazzi to film Ms. Heard as she was leaving court after filing the request for a TRO. His testimony about how the tip had to be confirmed as reliable made it clear that TMZ had received the tip from Ms. Heard. He further detailed how Ms. Heard had to the one who gave permission for TMZ to use the clip they received of Mr. Depp slamming kitchen cabinets because she was the “owner” (creator) of the clip. Then he revealed that the TMZ clip had been edited because it was missing the beginning and ending of the original that had been played in its entirety at court. (The original showed Ms. Heard setting up and hiding the camera and retrieving it at the end.)

Then there was the owner of the trailer park hotel who utterly refuted Ms. Heard’s claims that Mr. Depp jealously caused a scene in the lobby and then trashing their room and causing the manager to become angry about the destruction. He stated that Ms. Heard was the only one having a jealous fit, not Mr. Depp and reported that there was no “trashing” of the room, only a broken light sconce for which he charged Mr. Depp $65. That he reported himself as a survivor of DA and stated that he was triggered by Ms. Heard’s treatment of Mr. Depp in the lobby made his testimony extremely credible. 

Thus a jury concludes that Ms. Heard is lying, not once or twice, but multiple times in multiple events. 

Ms. Heard hijacked the ‘Me Too’ movement and attempted to use the “always believe the victim” axiom to make false allegations about DV/SV. She used the “powerful men are never held to account” axiom to accuse a man who had never, during his entire career, or in all the relationships he had on a professional or personal level, been accused of DV/SV by anyone. The PI with a reputation for “digging up the dirt” who Ms. Heard hired couldn’t find even a whisper of impropriety on Mr. Depp’s part. 

If there’s anyone to blame for setting back the “Me Too” movement, it’s Ms. Heard. Her impersonation of a victim shocked, dismayed, and angered real victims (and their supporters) all over the world. The jury didn’t have access to those responses.  They just had a preponderance of evidence that pointed to a web of lies and demonstrated that Mr. Depp was the actual victim here. 

The jury indeed believed the victim, they just had to make sure who it actually was. That is a victory which should be celebrated, not bemoaned.",0,2022-06-02T10:48:09Z,2022-06-02T10:48:09Z

@catloowitlatkla6116,"Stop telling me victims of abuse and women are equivalent.

I dislike being told over and over that survivors will relate to Amber. I have never once related to her. 

Maybe they should recognize that what some survivors are capable of seeing when looking at Johnny is another survivor; and when looking at Amber some might see someone similar to their own abuser (even if the genders are reversed). 

Talking about why it was so difficult for him to come forward sooner might actually even help other victims come forward. One would have to be ready to face whatever their own shame is, because that's often what is used to isolate victims. 

It's talking like this, assuming that despite all evidence to the contrary Amber must be the victim because she's the woman, that creates the very set back described in the first place. You would think any who is part of any organization that has a job that is really dedicated to helping survivors of abuse would know this.

.. give me a damn break... these idiots aren't even staying FACTS..... Depp said nothing defamatory but Jurors did fInd that Adam Waldman ,Depp's lawyer, acted as an ""agent"" for Depp when Waldman made a  statement to the Daily Mail calling Amber heards claims a hoax. Because of this Depp was held liable (unjustly so might I add)though they awarded $0 in punitive damages.THE U. K. CASE was not against amber heard so she didn't win anything in that case...it was against the newspaper and completely different type of lawsuit...so saying am we heard won in the UK trial but not this one is a damn lie! I went into this case completely biased and if there was any bias it was originally for Amber because I've been in a very absolve relationship.but evenidence QUICKLY SHOWED  Amber heard is a sick human being and referring to her as a human being is being very courteous... This woman providing her shit option is an absolute ignorant ass and I don't think she even watched the trial at all... If she had she would have seen that the evidence clearly showed that amber heard to bean abusive, narcissistic, manipulating, pathological liar... Ive been raped and abused both physically and mentally/emotionally... And from experience and bond sound others who have been through abuse & Nothing amber heard said or claimed was Genuine at all what so ever. She doesn't know how to feel anything. She mimics her behaviors like a typical narcissist... It makes me sick!! She is a shame to all women",0,2022-06-02T10:07:31Z,2022-06-02T10:07:31Z

@workoutwithgato,"Areva - I AM a survivor of domestic violence and abuse. I am also a woman. As part of the group you are so concerned about and offended for - let me tell you what I think about this case - Amber DID do unspeakable damage because now LESS women will be believed when they find the courage to speak up or get out of abusive relationships and situations. Amber lied, period. Johnny was the victim and I support and commend him for having the courage to stand up and say ""no more"". It is NOT about gender. It is about stopping abusers. Your disregard for his suffering because of his gender is appalling. If you have EVER actually been in an abusive situation you would be able to recognize via body language, tone, micro-expressions and other ""non-verbal"" forms of communication who is the aggressive one and who is not. You are ignoring these FACTS because they don't fit with your narrative. As a survivor of domestic abuse and violence I am over the moon with happiness for Johnny finally being seen and heard. Now he has a chance to get the help and support survivors need to recover. She tried to cancel and destroy him because that's what abusers do. Stop looking at this from a sexist perspective. I know men who have been abused by women and women who have been abused by men. It is NOT only one gender inflicting it upon the other. And the men who are abused are far less likely to speak up than abused women because society makes it next to impossible for them. Think on THAT fact. Run THOSE numbers. Get in touch with THOSE statistics. If you want to fight for a good cause then let it be to stop ALL abuse, not just gender specific abuse. ALL abuse. That means having compassion and understanding for MEN who are also victims and suffer as well. And if you are dead set on focusing on women's rights - consider this - it is only proper and fair that women also be held equally responsible for the crimes they commit against men. Women need to be just as accountable for their actions. Otherwise you aren't interested in equality or justice or fairness - you're only interested in creating a wedge and a rift of inequality between the genders. Stand against ALL violence, stand against ALL abuse. Not just when it suites your agenda. You cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of so many victims simply because they aren't women. We are ALL human .We ALL deserve to feel safe. Not just women. Not just any name you want to slap on any group. ALL of us. ALL humans.

@GrilloTheFlightless,"I don’t understand why the woman in this clip finds it so hard to understand the verdict. Amber saying she was abused doesn’t mean she was abused. Depp also said he’d been abused but, unlike Heard, he had some pretty good evidence. Combine that with the rather ‘actressy’ and less than convincing way in which she presented her testimony, and I find it baffling that anyone could believe what she says.

And for those who talk about setbacks to women who are abused, I say this. A heck of a lot of men suffer domestic abuse from women too. But they rarely come forward because there is a stigma attached to it in society. Many men find it humiliating. And, historically, when men do come forward they’re not always taken seriously. The attitude is that of “how can a man be bullied and beaten up by a women”. Those who speak up are often subject to emasculating jokes. It’s one area where the whole misconception that “women are the weaker sex”  actually works to women’s advantage, and I believe that Heard was trying to exploit that. She more or less admitted as much in the audio recording where she tells Depp that nobody will believe that he’s been abused.

Bear in mind also that many of Depp’s ex partners have said that he was never violent towards them, whereas Heard was arrested for an act of violence against a former partner, even though the charges were dropped.

The way she presented her evidence and the way she continually looked at the jury whilst speaking gave me the impression that she was being manipulative. Not to mention earlier on in the hearing she’d mimic the clothing that Depp wore the day before, including a neck scarf with a very distinctive bee motif, gives the impression to me that she was trying to unsettle, or maybe even intimidate, Depp.

Her sister’s account t of how Depp pushed her downstairs (from behind and lower down the stairs than her) not only sounded implausible, but also contradicted Amber’s own account. The only other real evidence were photo’s, which may or may not have been subject to tampering, of easily faked injuries such as bruises which suddenly disappeared the next day. Given how many photos she took, she never took any of the swelling or the pus oozing from her scalp that she mentions. Convenient, that.

But there will always be those who, for reasons of their own, will somehow try to make out that this is a blow against women from the big, bad patriarchy. It’s nothing of the sort.",0,2022-06-02T09:08:31Z,2022-06-02T09:08:31Z

Yet they continue
 to projector  her as someone who was wronged!!!
Unbelievabl!!!!
Best to Mr.Depp.
Unfortunately he was right no matter what the verdict this was this will  follow him the rest of his days.
I am very proud of him for putting his truth out there. This had to be very difficult to put his life out in the open for all the world to see. But very necessary, he was the defamed.  He was a victim of  D V. The jury deliberated and came back with a just verdict.

It's a win for society to be confronted with many issues about the way partner violence is dealt with in the feminist era. Issues such as the validity of categorizing partners into 'perpetrator' and 'victim' when most partner violence involves both parties committing various forms of violence. Issues such as allowing someone victim status even though (s)he was the predominant perpetrator. Issues such as the weaponizing of our legal system for women unfairly to damage men. Issues such as the frequency with which a woman crying in Court is considered to be proof beyond reasonable doubt. None of this is likely to make any quick difference to the feminist juggernaut but some seeds have been sown that might grow towards a much fairer system.",0,2022-06-02T08:22:52Z,2022-06-02T08:22:52Z

@ferdee9182,"Amber Heard is for sure not innocent.But do you really think Johnny Depp is?It's obvious that they were both monsters in this toxic relationship.But he was the one with much more power, money, life-experience and of course physical strength. So this is what makes abuse possible:The inequality of power. She was a 25year-old maybe crazy and greedy girl, but he was a 47year-old! Father of two teenage kids, millionaire and one of the world's most famous actors with bodyguards and an army of fans. How frightning could Slim-Amber have been for him?Maybe she was a challenge for his self-esteem as an aging man, yes. But fear of physical harm?No.
Idon't believe everything Amber testified and she really seems cold, superficial and quiet unlikeableto me. But is that important? I cannot imagine how I would feel and react under that kind of pressure. She must be desperate no matter what. What happens to her now is just a cruel witchhunt.Even if she made up certain things, you can easily imagine that there has been some kind of violence against her from JD, maybe he can't even remember, because he was drunk or high or whatever. But though there is some evidence, that he could have been violent against her, the public opinion is without doubt:He is an innocent victim and not capable of ever doing wrong. In the meantime she has become the personification
of the evil, beautiful, man-eating cheerleader cliché, that steals your boyfriend or if you are a man, humiliates you or hurts your pride, because she laughes at you or ignores you.

Women make false & or inflated allegations all the time that ruin lives & they rarely ever receive any punishment for doing so.
I believe that both of these people were abusive to eachother. However,  Amber's lies and manipulations were so enormous and ment to ruin Johnny's life. It was only after Amber's viscous public attack on Johnny that his lawyer made a rebuttal to Amber's allegations. Had Amber who was also clearly mentally, emotionally,  & physically abusing to Johnny, just simply gotten a divorce and said to herself,  we have both F'd eachother over and let's just move on with our lives, then none of this would have happened.

Amber Heard would have been better off had she presented less evidence and even better off had she not testified at all. She was convicted by her own words. Her evidence didn't match her testimony. Her testimony didn't match her witness's accounts. Most importantly none of it matched the many audio recordings that she created both legally and illegally. In those recordings the jury had the benefit of her own self-confession. According to her own words, she starts physical fights and Johnny Depp runs away and acts like a baby when she hits him. Johnny Depp's victory is not a colossal blow to women. It's a victory for victims of domestic abuse regardless of their gender.",0,2022-06-02T07:56:49Z,2022-06-02T07:57:50Z

And if you believe people in the UK, they say the UK trial was a farce! That should have been the end of that. But Amber continued with her lies. She wrote the op-ed. Pushing her narrative in the United States and why? Because she just couldn’t leave Johnny Depp alone. She tells you that herself! The recordings speak volumes. She was the abuser! No one ever saw Johnny hit her. But many saw her hit Johnny! That’s what they testified to! It doesn’t set women back! It exposes an abuser! Johnny sued her because she would not be quiet and kept accusing him of abuse. I strongly believe she never banked on Johnny suing her. In the recordings he tells her he loves her very much.

Did she listen to the multiple recordings of AH taunting, screaming, belittling, calling him names and telling him to suck her dick? you know, saying all the things that would be the opposite an abuse victim would say to their abuser? Did she hear the recordings of JD always trying to escape a confrontation with AH? And how she would follow him to each room he is hiding in to continue berating him? again, doing stuff that someone who fears for their life would not do. Did she question why AH had no visible wounds or medical records from being punched repeatedly in the face so many times she lost count and became unconscious. punched with a fist with huge rings on every finger (think brass knuckles) that would certainly break through skin - and then the next day, she's at an event and flawless. Does she think an abuse victim would leave a pile of human feces on their abuser's side of the bed? Did she see AH not shed single tear while testifying, as hard as she tried? It was very telling when her acting couch witness testify that AH can't cry when she's acting? CNN - can you please consider having apposing view points when 2 contributors are commenting on a newsworthy story?

@jmcg9329,"Absolutely disgusting how this ""legal analyst"" essentially blames normal people for coming to this decision after over a month and a half of trial proceedings, observing and reviewing the evidence, and taking more than three days to reach a verdict. 

Anyone who actually watched the trial could easily see that Heard had no evidence to corroborate her claims while Depp was the one with mountains of evidence. The only thing these people have is the UK trial. Sorry, but who gives a crap? This is the United States, not the UK. The UK doesn't even have jury trials for most cases. So, it's going to be interesting because soon I'm going to suspect that the people who are die hard Heard supporters (most of whom admit didn't watch the trial or most of it) will now start to argue that we need to get rid of jury trials in the US because the public can be ""gaslight"" by these people accused of abuse.",2,2022-06-02T07:17:58Z,2022-06-02T07:17:58Z

But the narcissistic media seem to want still push their narrative. The uk court didn't rule on the fact that Johnny was the abuser but more on the fact that the Sun didn't act with malice. It was no ruling on him being the abuser. The evidence was presented clearly before you and yet you side with Amber Heard the abuser because you want to push the false feministic narrative that women can never be the abuser. When you say that 10% of women lies when it comes to abuse claims, what then gives you the right to disregard the possibility that Amber Heard's claim could be part of that 10%.

This is the problem, even when in such a public trial where the whole world is watching, it is quite clear that AH is a psychopath who lied constantly. How does anyone defend her when she has just put the protection of women back years. Women’s rights organisations should be livid with her, not defending her lies. She spoke out publicly about abuse that didn’t exist, and all she has done is make people doubt when women do speak out. When women make accusations we are supposed to believe them because it’s such a hard thing to do, and AH has used that to get attention and further her image and yet none of it is true. JD may not be perfect, he clearly has substance abuse problems, which AH has clearly proved to have too, but there is no evidence that he physically abused her, and definitely none of sexual abuse. On the contrary, all that this proved was that she was abusive, and the net result of this is that women who in future do speak out are going to be even more scrutinised. I just hope that this trial weeds out the women in future that do make accusations that are false, because abuse needs to be put a stop to, and so do women who falsely accuse men of abuse for gain.

@n3xtc3n4,Amber Turd should be going to jail for ruining Johnny's life. There should be a law in place and enforced consistently for people getting jail time for making false allegations on innocent people. There are many innocent people in prison right now because they were falsely accused of sexual violence and the courts believe the women and many times it is without any evidence. Much like what Amber Turd tried to do with Johnny. This is not only a big win for Johnny but a big win and a big step in changing the ways of the courts of just believing women solely because they are women and to make women think twice in making false allegations because they need to provide real evidence in court.,1,2022-06-02T06:43:56Z,2022-06-02T06:43:56Z

@IcariumGaming,"I was abused for years by my ex-wife, I did my best to protect my son. When she finally stabbed me, not the first time she has physically abused me or cut me, I had enough and called the police. She was arrested, charged, and subsequently convicted. However after she was removed from the home she filed an emergency divorce application for custody alleging that I was the abuser and that she suffered for years.

I lost my son for six months. I had to pay spousal support as she refused to get a job, child support, and $350/two hour visit every other week with my son for nearly six months. 

I finally got evidence that she was leaving him home alone to go out with friends, and shopping. I used that with the courts and they gave me 50/50. He was 5 at the time, 4 when she stabbed me.

The courts are so rigged to believe women, that I am happy to see a man win in a domestic situation.",5,2022-06-02T06:42:12Z,2022-06-02T06:43:32Z

Facts so troubling for a major news station to be derelict of.  Late night talk shows made sport of this trial but at least they knew who the real monster was.  Day time talk shows and major news media continually crucified Depp without watching the trial at all. Many participants  poopooed why this case would receive national attention.

And with all the testimony regarding abuse from both sides to fail to give the jury instruction re what DV is legally, how could they answer that question. Since they could not fill out the forms correctly I wonder if their instructions were clear. **Remember those text Depp wrote.....horriblly sexually abusive language.** His words speak to who he is and what he was capable of doing.

@kateashby3066,"This is for your female opinion (don’t know her name)- here’s the deal, when a jury gets a sense that you’re lying and maybe that you’ve lied a LOT, it doesn’t matter if ONE of your claims was truthful. When you’re dealing with someone willing to manipulate evidence and lie under oath, it’s FINE to toss out everything they say because they’re acting in bad faith AND you now know you can’t trust them. The jury acted 100% spot on here and they were fair too. They got JD on the count where his lawyer said AH wrecked their penthouse before calling the cops (speculation, not fact). He shouldn’t have said that unless he knew it went down like that. That was careless. But it’s absurd for this chick in the video here to say that all it takes is once. Guess what? Too bad! If we can’t believe her because she lies all the time- it’s AMBER’s fault that the jury couldn’t buy ANY of her story. Not the jury’s. She totally stained the “me too” movement and frankly I’m glad she shed an important light on this basic fact: we presume innocence until proven otherwise in America. That is until this movement came about. Since then we have seen a few really bad apples ruin good peoples lives. No more. Men AND women are victims of DV and moving forward we need to hear all sides out before assuming. It’s sad we can’t trust ALL victims. Blame Heard, Smolette, the woman who accused Aziz of not being able to read her mind when she didn’t wanna have sex with him but did it anyways.",0,2022-06-02T06:18:48Z,2022-06-02T06:21:47Z

I am disturbed by this because these are what I consider liberal news outlets doing this, and I consider myself at least partially liberal.  So I consider them at least partly on my team, and right now, my team is dead wrong.

The only one that this is a bad day for is anyone ignorant enough to listen to this lady and all the hate she is spewing because it was a mostly male jury.

There was a really high percentage of people who were not fans of JD, but siding with him because they themselves had experienced DV or other narcissistic abuse - they all just said, that all the  behaviour of AH reminded them of their abusers. That was the reason for a high percentage of people watching this trial - to see justice win against a bad abuser with a really bad Cluster B personality disorder. Why so? Because in many cases narcissists convince people to believe the abuser instead of the victim. So psychologically spoken: In AH, the verdict was against all their ""own"" perpetrators.

@4whirledpeas,"Dr. Ramani Durvasula estimates that 1 in 5 people are narcissists (a cluster B personality disorder very close to the ""histrionic"" disorder assigned to Amber Heard, as reported by the psychiatrist in the trial).

That means that MANY OF US have been subjected to some sort of narcissistic abuse.  WE KNOW that covert narcissistic abuse is insidious.  And we recognized it in Amber's testimony.

This is not a male/female thing.  It is an unmasking narcissism thing.  

Narcissists systematically destroy all sense of identity and ability to trust oneself - as in the movie GASLIGHT.  They cycle through the pattern of love bombing,  gaslighting, manipulation, and devaluation .... then hoovering and love bombing ... on repeat.   Amber even had a cadre of ""flying monkeys"" (I believe that's a technical term) for people who enable the narcissist and help to completely destroy and shred the target. When the target finally loses their minds, the narcissist uses it as proof of the target's guilt.  They blow things completely out of proportion.   A narcissist will trip you so they can be the ones to help you up -  - portraying themselves as indispensable.  

If anyone REALLY wants to know what animates Depp's supporters, please look up the insidiousness of covert narcissism. 

The media keeps wondering WHY this case has gotten so much attention.  My guess is because SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF ABUSE (and that they have suffered in silence because the perpetrator often gets away with it).  Many, many people (both male and female)  would like for it to finally be identified and exposed. 

The internet is FULL of videos and websites dedicated to narcissistic abuse!!!  (Just look for yourself!)  Why is so this difficult for the media to understand?  We want ""justice for Johnny"" because we want justice for ourselves ... and all of us.",0,2022-06-02T05:05:47Z,2022-06-02T05:05:47Z

@John-vp2jq,"Pointing out the statistic that only 10% of women lie in their claims against others, even taken at face value, is misleading in this context.  One other fact is that Heard was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  Borderline personality disorder includes a propensity to lie or otherwise manipulate others in the pursuit of control over them.  As Dr. Curry so brilliantly pointed out at the trial, it also carries a heightened likelihood to abuse the legal system for one's own aims.  Thus, Heard's diagnosis on its own materially increases the possibility that she would lie to get what she wants in this case.  I am glad the jury noted the inconsistencies in Heard's testimony and other manipulations on the stand, in conjunction with her diagnosis, to find her claims less than credible.  This is a win for survivors of IPV/DV, as much as the typical gender roles in this particular case have been flipped.",0,2022-06-02T05:04:12Z,2022-06-02T05:04:12Z

@TheDonosul,"I hear and have a great deal of sympathy for Ms Martin’s POV, but, in my experience the vast majority of the negative comments about Ms Heard on social media originate from females!

So you can not have it both ways and in relation to her statistic that one in three of women (who presumably were asked the question) reported experiences of physical abuse within a relationship. My question to her would be: how many men who had similar experiences feel confident about sharing that information?

But I would spare her the time required to think about, try to research and answer that question because, frankly: nobody knows the answer.

What I do know from my own experience of living and working in truly diverse communities is that many women are openly and habitually both verbally and physically aggressive not just towards men, but to other women too! Try getting such people even investigated, let alone reprimanded for such behaviour and see how far you get?",0,2022-06-02T04:48:47Z,2022-06-02T04:53:08Z

How can ANYONE be upset that Amber Heard didn’t get away with lying about someone r@ping her with a liquor bottle??????!!!!  Seriously??? That’s mind boggling. If you’re upset by that you’re probably the type to do the same type of crazy BS.  If JD ever abused her, had she been honest about it, not altered photos, not recorded herself gaslighting him (only to get evidence that he assaults cabinets) perhaps she woulda had a better day in court. If she was truly a victim then she wouldn’t have felt the need to manufacture evidence. It’s not right to expect the jury to try to figure out what was true and what wasn’t. The jury absolutely got it RIGHT.

She straight up lied to everyone- millions across the world saw it.  Worst case scenario, she could be in trouble in 3 different countries.  This was a big win for victims without a voice- not “powerful” men.  It was never about the money for JD- he wanted his life back after the hell he and his family have endured for years.

Not just regular citizens, but body language experts and insane amounts of lawyers have spoke out and made it very clear - this was a performance from the get go. She had way to many holes in her story . Changed and evolving over time.

And how about the evidence that didn't make it into court, like the tape of Austrailia proving that she was not only NOT sexually abused...or abused in any way, but she was crying and admiting to having cut off Johnny's finger. No real witnesses for Heard.  And yes, men used to have freedom to do whatever they wanted to their wives but Johnny Depp should not have to be sacrificed in order for victims to move ahead.

Therefore, this attorney has changed the narrative just to accommodate her agenda, which is to take the woman's side no matter what, no matter if they've lied blatantly.  Three of Amber's lies:  1) she donated her money, where she truly tried to mislead the jury 2) she didn't throw the bottles and can't remember, when there is an extended recording (which the jury didn't even get to hear) where she exposes herself clearly and 3) he abused her with a vodka bottle, when she only came up with that recently.

CNN is complicit in trial by media and they haven’t done this only to Johnny Depp but others are well.

Amber is on the hook for $8M ($10M minus the $2M she was awarded), plus $350K (the maximum allowed punitive amunt in that state). But she has the $7M she hadn't yet given to charity, so I suppose she will divert those funds to pay for this. So she will only be in the hole for 1.35M, plus her lawyers' fees. Where she will really hurt is in future work. Depp's supporters are as rotten and vindictive as he is. They will rally to have her out of Aquaman and continue to tear her apart in Social Media.

@davego3340,"This jury rejected the mountain of evidence that showed Amber Heard had been abused by Johnny Depp. Really? Didn't you observe all of the contradictions that she made?  

You think bringing up the 10% lying statistic means that Amber is 100% telling the truth? Despite having misleading narratives, such as 
- saying she's never landed a blow on him while admitting to and slapping him in the face 

- Claiming her police officers, doctors, maids, managers all chose to ignore or didn't see bruising on her for various reasons
- Mixing up dates by years, while testifying that she'd never forget the first time she was abused
- Heard's lawyers explaining how she uses a very specific makeup palette for her bruises (which didn't exist when she claimed to use it), and Heard testifying, while slipping that she actually used a ""bruise kit"" to hide her bruises. Bruise kits actually create the appearance of bruises
- Claiming she's never played a guitar for some reason? 
- Testifying that she uses donate and pledge synonymously while avoiding the word ""donate"" when questioned, and explaining how she couldn't donate a single cent more of the money that she didn't even want from Depp for over a year because 13 months after she won, she got sued

I'll stop there with the examples. Is it at all possible that Amber Heard is within this <10th percentile of females who lie about sexual abuse?

@scorpioschild706,"The reason the jury didn’t believe the allegations is that she freakin’ lied. Don’t lie and justice will prevail. The female journalist  doesn’t address the preponderance of evidence that this woman didn’t want the truth to get in the way of a good story. I think amber’s dishonesty is what is hurting the “movement” which constitutes a special interest group by now as fronted by the ACLU. 
What about false allegations?What about the damage? This woman is telling me that the judgement was flawed and that the reason Johnny Depp should have failed is that he is a powerful man…which is really cliché at this point. Thanks for the bias.
People are people. They behave like people do. There was enough information to indicate Amber was dishonest. Her diagnosis has much to do with her choices, her thoughts, feelings and behaviours. 
The outcome is not at all surprising to me. The jury aren’t the only people who think that her story is unbelievable. The whole world can see that. 
So I feel for those who have to go through DA because they will have to fight their way through the stigma created by the attempted deception. I am one of those people. I am a man and I got abused. Perhaps the fact that I’m a man having anything to do with the judgement needs to be addressed on a very fundamental legal level.

However I have watched the trial and seen what evidence was given and while I dont think Johnny was completely innocent in any of this, I definitely do think beyond a doubt that Amber was the power in that couple and ensured that johnny knew this.

a) the defendant in that case was a newspaper called The Sun, amber was just a witness
b) he was found guilty because so much of the evidence in the US trial wasn’t allowed into the UK trial as it wasn’t deemed ‘relevant’.

AH was in it for the money. DV victims have evidence, AH had NO evidence of physical or sexual abuse. AH lied about the violence, lied about the sexual abuse, and lied about the color of the sky. By her own testimony she abused JD far worse than he treated her. She verbally & emotionally abused him when she antagonized, instigated, criticized, attacked, lied to, humiliated, mocked and gaslit him. She physically abused him when she threw pots and pans at his head, threw vodka bottles at him, and physically hit him. The jury saw through her lies, the public saw through her lies, please tell me how Areva Martin did not see through her lies?

Women are just much more likely to report it and file a TRO. Women are also more likely to be injured by the abuse. I wish men would speak up more often. The fact that they do not demonstrates that chauvinism is alive and well.

I watched the entire Depp v. Heard trial, and yes, Amber Heard appeared to have made up ""out of whole cloth"" all of the allegations of physical and sexual abuse. She is a conspicuous liar, and almost everyone could see it. Not only did she not have a ""mountain of evidence""; she could not even scrape up a mole hill. She took numerous photos and videos of herself, and the media took many more. And yet somehow Amber forgot to take a single credible photograph of the broken nose or bruises she would have sustained when Johnny punched her in the face multiple times with his ""big chunky rings"" as she testified. 

Real victims of DV do not file TRO's and then get caught laughing with their friends walking down the street conspicuously missing the bruise on their face from the day before. Real victims do not become ACLU ambassadors and publish Op-Ed pieces in the Washington Post calling out their perpetrators. Real victims shed genuine tears when recounting their abuse and are afraid to look their abusers in the eyes. Real victims do not scream ""I'm a victim"" and seek the limelight; they quietly tell their stories and hope that the right people are listening.

Amber Heard is directly to blame for any damage caused to women and the MeToo movement. I do not, however, believe that the women's movement has been set back. I think everyone just needs to realize that men are victims too and that some people are flagrant, unabashed liars. It's difficult for us to accept that there are bad people in the world because we cannot imagine that people intentionally behave that badly . . . or that they look like beautiful, blonde, female movie stars. Moreover, most of us do not experience these people on a daily basis. But they exist, and they come in both genders. Blame Amber. Don't blame Johnny; all he did was show that men are victims too.",22,2022-06-02T03:31:19Z,2022-06-02T03:31:19Z

@Kaitos11,"You can't claim to want justice and then scoff when an outcome doesn't conform to your views. I'm a firm supporter of the Me Too movement because there are tons of dickward men who abuse their power for sexual gratification and they need to be called out, shamed and be jailed but at the same time, we need to protect those from people who would co-opt a movement to hurt a person they want to destroy. Less than 10 percent of abuse victims lie? Amber falls in that statistic as her testimony was riddled with inconsistencies because, unlike other trials, this trial was public and we could all see it with our own eyes.

Abuse isn't just done by men, women can also abuse men. We can't start a trial with an already biased view without hearing the facts. Innocent until proven guilty, after all.

THAT being said, I'm troubled by how Heard was portrayed at times when this trial was covered. Among other things, pictures of the trial showed Depp relaxed and smiling whereas pictures of Heard showed her angry and ""ugly crying"". There was a clear campaign done to portray her negatively even before she testified. When she finally testified, even more ridiculous stuff was being spread like Heard supposedly snorting cocaine while on the stand.

Perkins Coie as a legal entity made this admission to Congress about having had an FBI portal on their premises since 2012.  

Perkins Coie is cooperating.  It's only explanation.  

Elias left Perkins Coie first, about 3 months ahead of Sussmann getting indicted. 

Sussmann was either fired or resigned immediately after he was indicted. 

PC gave up the billing records and emails and memoranda in response to the Durham grand jury federal subpoenas.

Johnny wasn't a saint by any means, but he wasn't a monster either and didn't deserve what she tried to do to him out of spite.

Same as most women getting full custody of a child when the man has been just as much a part in that kid's life, but they're favored because they're a woman. How many men win those cases?

There is nothing sacred that people will not lie about nowadays. 

They didn’t believe her because the evidence gathered contradicted what she said actually happened. Not to mention multiple law-enforcement speculations that she was lying because every time her story would change. The physics didn’t match how she said the events between her and Johnny took place. Remember to take every recording that Amber heard presented with a grain of salt. Remember she knew she was being recorded which means she was careful in what she said and how she worded things. She was on a malicious campaign she directly gave evidence to TMZ and other media platforms to further defame Johnny Depp‘s character. 

If anybody faced the wrath of Hollywood it was Johnny Depp considering all his losses if anybody benefited it was Amber heard she ripped the luxuries of playing a victim and had all these people falling at her feet.

Amber was asked whether she thought the whiskey bottle was broken insider her vagina. She said she wasn’t sure. EVERYONE with a vagina will tell you, you will know if that happened. 

Plus if it were true, she needed to get medical help for that. She never went to a hospital for any of her alleged injuries. None.

Johnny winning is real justice.

Something you know nothing about CNN. 

You and your irrelevant guests that nobody know who they are and who support an abuser just because she is a female.

Based on her false allegations that she couldn't prove because she was lying. 

Amber didn't prove anything in this trial and the UK case was Johnnys defamation case against a UK newspaper. 

They proved nothing in that case against Johnny and the UK judges sided with a UK newspaper.

@penguinguy9820,"Amber Heard: Shits in his bed, cuts off his finger, hits him, throws things at him, puts out cigarettes on him, falsely accuses him of DV, uses her make-up artist friend to create fake bruises, calls the police to try and have him arrested, publicly damages his career.

Amber Heard Stans: Just awful how these powerful men are beating down on the poor women.

Also, Amber got her 15 minutes in the spotlight, will get 2 million in damages, and will no doubt go on to have an illustrious career talking about ""her abuse"" at any event that will take her.

Yes, we need to end the belief that all victims of DV and rape are liars. But supporting a liar, and then having it very publicly blow up in their face, only perpetuates this belief. Instead, we need to support real victims, which means maybe holding off jumping on a story for a few minutes and actually picking the case apart. Only when real victims get justice, will we progress.

If you want a world where victims of DV and rape can speak out and get justice, you need to stop supporting liars, because it makes the world more sceptical of real victims.",13,2022-06-02T02:11:30Z,2022-06-02T02:11:30Z

And they always had the question who was around them is it because of their Fame and Fortune or somebody really trying to know them and it was always Fame and Fortune so you got two Rich people. Spoiled ass brats got married couldn't offer each other anything but pain and suffering deceit manipulation lying because they never knew what love really was. Because love came with a price of Fame and Fortune and yet I don't even know why the court wasted time with this. Spoiled ass rich people talking about each other doing what they want to do behind closed doors and then they come out talking about defamation of character use a drug addict that was beaten on this woman and she was looking for love and don't even know what love is so she's giving you her pain and suffering and you giving her your pain and suffering and you two are destroying each other talking about you in love.

The jury was common folk who saw through the fake testimony that AH gave. A true villian. She said that all the witnesses including police officers were lying under oath. The footage, voice recordings, photos were all there. She manipulated them and tried to come off as an innocent person. I've read several comments from actual survivors (women)who have said they didn't believe her either because of their own experiences. AH truly is guilty without a doubt and justice was served.

She is everything that is WRONG about the #MeToo movement. I'm absolutely disgusted by people like her. And shame on you, CNN. Shame on you. Men can also be victims and they deserve justice as well.

@joetube141,"Much of the verdict starts from the TRO play against Johnny to leverage more money with the extortion letter and the TMZ tip off. 
Countless credible witnesses that found no injuries on Amber's face. Right before the TRO that included a TMZ tip-off Amber had a letter sent to Johnny which amounts to extortion with Amber demanding three penthouses, $50,000 a month and the Range Rover !!! Johnny said no way !!! Amber had been working early on to entrap Johnny, Amber even included the Joker villain maniacal laughing too !!!
This is a big day for the millions of men that are not big and powerful who have had to endure highly abusive women and even more often than is believed physical abuse too. The CNN folks are ignoring many other things involved in this case and the other half of society that is not all big powerful super rich men. Also Amber got paid good money for the Johnny kitchen cabinet video she sold exclusively to TMZ. She lied about that and everybody in the courtroom knew it. 
Amber Hijacked the #Metoo movement with emergency TRO and TMZ.
Let's not forget the ACLU and the Washington Post. It is very generous of Amber to donate other people's money to charity and then not pay all of it for 13 months before Johnny sued her. 
People can make up lots of excuses.

She says that like it's a small number. 10% is huge. But even if it was some miniscule fraction, you can't decide cases based on broad statistics. The question was whether Amber Heard defamed Johnny Depp, not whether women in general are truthful.

However, I do agree that this might lead to precedent where affluent men use the legal system to shame their accuser. That's a problem, but the social lynching associated with metoo also has exactly the same problem.

@blue-calla,"Areva Martin - lnform YourseIf‼️ It’s an easily proven fact that Justice Andrew Nicol who presided over the UK case (as judge) of Depp v The Sun is corrupt. The 7 points below ⬇️ show his multiple connections to Amber Heard, her attorney, and The Sun, which caused conflicts of interest that were never disclosed. He should’ve recused himself.

1️⃣ Jennifer Robinson (who was Amber’s attorney) is friends with Camila Palmer (who is Justice Andrew Nicol’s wife).

2️⃣ Justice Andrew Nicol wrote a book with Geoffrey Robertson (Geoffrey Robertson is a mentor and employer of Jennifer Robinson, who was Amber Heard’s lawyer).

3️⃣ When appointed to the case, Justice Andrew Nicol was employed by Geoffrey Robertson’s firm, Doughty Street Chambers.

4️⃣ Jennifer Robinson took Amber Heard to a private dinner party, in July, during the trial (there were photographs of this event in publications). Also attending that dinner were Baroness Helena Kennedy and the party was hosted by Kathy Lette.

5️⃣ Baroness Helena Kennedy was also employed by Doughty Street Chambers, and Kathy Lette is Geoffrey Robertson’s ex-wife. They’re also close friends with Jennifer Robinson and Camila Palmer (who is Justice Andrew Nicol’s wife).

6️⃣ These women have been supporting Amber Heard for years in her UN functions and by publishing their support during the trial.

7️⃣ Lastly, Justice Andrew Nicol’s son works for Talkradio, who employs Dan Wootton. Dan Wootton is the one who wrote the article calling Johnny Depp a “wife beater;” the article that made Johnny go forward with the libel case in the UK.

Even if the judge didn’t realize every single connection, he undoubtedly knew most. Even one would be too much. But the judge carried on in the trial and decided that Amber Heard’s hearsay claims and speculations were credible, and dismissed most of Johnny Depp’s hard evidence, including surveillance footage, emails, audio recordings, pictures, tapes, checks, and even the witness statements of Johnny Depp’s bodyguard and LAPD members. He believed everything Heard said even when there were massive holes in her story and proof she lied (even about donating the $7m to charity — which Nicol said was the reason she couldn’t be a “gold digger,” b/c she donated $7m, which was proven to be a lie). He also didn’t allow Depp to appeal his ruling. He retired shortly after.

The US jury ruled in JD’s favor b/c they actually looked at the evidence. Cope harder. 🙄",0,2022-06-02T01:02:42Z,2022-06-02T01:02:42Z

@chriswylie253,"A BIG win for victims of spousal abuse, including defamation. When a rich, famous, powerful, male is vindicated for what he suffered, the jury sent a clear message of ZERO tolerance for spousal abuse, including defamation. No more excuses. Ironically, some ""feminists"" are using the same arguments that were used against women for years, that they should ""toughen up"" ""stop complaining"" or as Amber Heard yelled at Johnny, ""I didn't punch you, I hit you, stop being a baby"".  Women also were told for years that if they were well off financially they should tolerate a spouses abuse. The jury said NO MORE.  In the age of gender fluidity, feminist's are now  outdated relics of a different era when women were seen as victims. Modern women don't buy the victim mentality. The jury didn't buy it either.",0,2022-06-02T01:00:58Z,2022-06-02T01:07:03Z

@smellyolegoat150,"The loss for women is that Amber Heard lied like a rug.  She really damaged the credibility of other real victims.  What she did to women’s credibility is unforgivable.  Blindly defending Amber Heard also damages credibility.  I personally, even as a gay man have known multiple women throughout my life that told horrible lies about abuse.  One of them went so far as to hit herself, scratch herself, and tear her own clothes up.  Another that I had set up in her job, and remodeled her house for her told a bunch of lies that made my life a living Hell for months, and probably permanently damaged my reputation with some people.  She came back over a year later.  She was trying to apologize.  She told me, “she liked to think it wasn’t her” as in, she wasn’t herself because she was stressed out and had inappropriate feelings for me.  There are others, but this comment is already to long.  
So please don’t try a blanket defense of women who claim to be victims.  My personal experiences with women tell me that unfortunately there are all too many willing to say or do anything out of jealousy and plain evil spite.
I’ve been known to joke to friends that there is a reason I’m gay when referring to too many women I’ve had the misfortune of having in my life.  You know what they say about jokes and teasing……….",0,2022-06-02T00:55:19Z,2022-06-02T00:55:19Z

@cuttru8041,"These can't be serious ""legal"" analysts. It seems obvious that they didnt actually watch the trial and just make generalized statements and push narratives. 

There was no mountain of evidence for AH in this case, but there was a mountain of evidence against her and that she lied and did it with malice. Just look at her story at Hicksville where she made up a story about the Manger and that same Manager came forward to contradict her story. Also, look at Dr Curry's testimony where her psychological evaluation showed that AH grossly exaggerated her symptoms of PTSD so she could get a diagnosis. The evidence also revealed that AH admitted on tape to physically abusing Depp.

Allegations of physical and sexual abuse should always be taken seriously, but in this case, the evidence shows, that AH was not a victim but only pretended to be one. People like AH are a disgrace to real victims of sexual and physical abuse...

I am starting to believe CNN no longer operates in reality.  You seem to be stuck in a echo chamber that is clearly not a part of reality. 

yes this is a win for powerful men and its because amber heard gave them this win by being a manipulative liar.  Johnny Depp spent millions to prove that he was a victim.  And you make him a villain because he has the money to clear his name.

CNN has officially become degenerate trash.  

Amber Heard made people question women like me and the Millions of us true victim that was too scared to speak up.  AMBER HEARD slapped us in the face.  Not the patriarchy, not white male privilege, not weath but THAT WOMAN.

I'm sure CNN will ignore my comment and the Millions like mine.  But make no mistake:  CNN is not too big to fail.

Discovery acquired CNN and will systematically flush the diseased filth that has become your news room.  CNN will continue to bleed money until the shareholders step in and completely shut CNN down.

At what point will you actually analyze an incident neutrally without making it sound a bit political. Please stop with the narrative that this is wrong for women because it isn't. This only confirms that no one (men or women) should be publicly humiliated over an allegation until proven so. I hate it when mainstream media just refuses to see things as it truly is. It was very clear that Amber was untruthful in many instances based on evidence and facts. 
Do you want a society where a Man could never be believed??

But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).
Come now,  and let us reason together,  saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.Isaiah 1:18

For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves     
it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. Galatians 2:21

I'm not down playing real domestic violence. But, she's not a victim of Johnny Depp. She's done nothing for women. She's done more harm to women with her lies. I can't believe that CNN is trying to take her side. She proved nothing with her allegations. She NEVER went to a doctor. She said she was s.a.'d with a bottle but never went to the hospital. She even had her own nurse and doctor! We have to be on the side of the truth. Not on the side of a gender. The audio's alone showed she wasn't scared of Depp. She belittled him and egged him on. That's not what an 'abused person"" does. She lied about paying a ""donation"" to charities. She said she uses ""pledged"" and ""donated"" synonymously. You can't. They have complete different definitions. She kept the 7 million dollar divorce settlement for 13 months before there was a payment made. NOT by her but Johnny! The next from Elon! None from her. She shouldn't have gotten a settlement at all. The ""trashing"" of the apartment should've been fought by her lawyers. It was not. That's not Johnny's fault. She followed him, harassed him whenever he tried to get away from her. That's not her being abused. That's him being abused. Even her ""friends"" went against her. None said they ever saw Johnny be physically abusive to her. She defecated on his side of the bed! What sane person does that? I am a woman and I felt such distain for her because her blatant lies. I mean after the expert talked about Metadata, the next day Amber was an expert too and said she couldn't tell the pictures she put to the court of the same picture but different dates because the Metadata was in the way?! You don't have to go to law school to know that was a lie. I more than not agree with much of what CNN analyst say but here, you all have it 100% wrong. The UK trial was a different entity from this defamation trial. The verdict over there has nothing to do what this trial here was about. She was caught in most of her lies.

Take the L with dignity, CNN (and the rest of the Mainstream Media). YOU LOST. JOHNNY WON. THE PEOPLE WON. IT'S OVER. AMBER HEARD'S CAREER IS OVER! THE DAYS OF PEOPLE BELIEVING YOUR FALSE NARRATIVES ARE OVER! 

Keep in mind, I am left-wing, and I still supported Johnny over Amber. Because I believe in sanity, not gender or politics when something as important as this calls for it. It's not that hard of a concept to grasp! 

This has to be a wake-up call for people who fall for this ""Believe all Women!"" nonsense. If you still do believe it even after all of this, it reveals who you truly are.

@msboncat1959,I guess you did not hear Amber freely admitting that she was being abusive to Johnny. Telling him that nobody would believe he was abused by her.  She dared him to tell his story because nobody would believe that a man could be abused by a woman.   There was another tape with Johnny asking her for a divorce. Amber was begging him not to leave her.   It is plain that Amber was attempting to turn things back on Johnny because he wanted to divorce her.  Amber's own words caused her to lose her case against Johnny.  Amber is not a battered woman she was just trying to get even  and make it so Johnny could not act again.  Amber is not helping women who really have been abused by their spouse.   We all need to take note there are men out there that have been abused by women.,0,2022-06-02T00:20:07Z,2022-06-02T00:20:07Z

Amber Heard set back women with her lies. Woman can speak up and speak out and now so can men.
