@EaZiE01,"Hallelujah! I never knew what happened as I don't watch politics because I already knew they were corrupt. If only we could have overthrew our piece of shit government forever but I know that'll never happen because they have all this money and they'll just punish ALL the American people. Also, I don't agree with white supremacy but when you look at the democratic party its almost an appropriate response the way they tease the whites by pampering to other races. All that immigration isn't because the dems love all people. I have to spell it out for them - its to get their numbers up. And Jesus Christ would it be so shocking if the gov stole the election? Is slavery and native plundering not shocking? Conclusion: is a government that you can't overthrow worth having? No, but the riot is a representation of how people feel about it It - the entire 2 party lie.. Money has priority over people in capitalist government.

@MarilyRodriguez-j9v,"What you are watching is very selective clips of what happened on January 6th. The people that are being destructive are not magga. They are antifa disguised as magga that were bust in at some point and infiltrated the crowd. There were also FBI agents in the crowd stirring people to commit violent acts. Where are the videos of the police escorting

Where are the videos of the police, the capital police, waving people into the capital as people calmly and peacefully went inside without guns, without rifle, and without any motive to create an insurrection since they weren't armed to begin with..

The video doesn't show how MAGA supporters came up to police and begged them to intervene because some people were getting violent..

And of course, what President Trump said, this video is editing and clipping things he said to make it look like he was stirring an insurrection. And this is absolutely disgusting.

At around 25:50 you say that we are more divided than ever in ways that cannot be healed. And I agree. It would indeed be nice if we could all get on. But then you say ‘the people who stormed the capital think that Jews, gay people etc are subhuman…’

What, all of them? Like, every single one of them? 

Sure, there are groups who do. Oath keepers, proud boys, other Nazi groups I don’t want to know the names of etc etc. But what about the other demographics who were there? The ones, for example, who genuinely thought it was their patriotic duty to halt the ‘stolen’ election based on lies they’d been told over and over for weeks, even months? Do they all hate Jews? All of them? Does every single one of them hate black people to the point of thinking they are subhuman?

Look at all of our hard earned tax payer dollars going to wars across the world, GOING TO ISRAEL TO SUPPORT THE GENOCIDE. There was crack found in the White House. I’m not saying the right doesn’t have major flaws, I mean just watch the video, but also look at the hours of footage that’s been released throughout these 4 years of the riot. The economy and the world was better under trump even if he said and did dumb things the left is literally trying to send him to prison so they can win the election. There’s a whole “documentary” if you can call it that of the media lying about things trump did that are proven false. I just watch this guys video on how liberals are a threat to western civilization and how they say they’re on your side but really arnt go watch that video and come back here. Like I said before there are major flaws on both sides but the left could genuinely care less about our country they lie to us and do not care about us at all they only say they do to appease the people.

@kidz4p509,"Donald Trump’s time as US President is forever scarred by his “racist” views.

Before and throughout Trump’s time in office, he has often shown general hostility towards Hispanic folk, mainly immigrants from Mexico. When he became president, Hispanic folk living in the US have been constant targets for racial discrimination, ranging from kids getting bullied in school, to adults getting harassed in the streets, almost as if Trump made it legal for US civilians to harass Hispanic folk and get away with it. Then, in 2019, El Paso, Texas became the scene of a shooting massacre, committed by a white supremacist who echoed Trump’s words.

Then, 2020 came, and the coronavirus pandemic occurred, and thus, Trump and his followers found a new target: Chinese folk. Since the virus originated from China, people of Asian origin (and I say that since non-Chinese folk are often mistaken for Chinese folk) were racially harassed as well.

That’s why the January 6 Riot had white supremacists in the mix. They wanted to maintain the status quo of non-whites getting discriminated.",1,2024-03-22T02:29:05Z,2024-03-22T02:29:05Z

Meanwhile real poor people worked dairy farm's picked vegetables and fruit in 100° heat no breaks no bathrooms below minimum wage and lived in 8 to a 2 bedroom others in their cars and extended hotels.

Now they had a race and class hating signing monkey to the white good ole boy wealthy class destroying any aid to the colored and poor Americans what Obama administration took 8 years to actually aid.covid came 3 years later and exposed the real actions of Trump administration with Mitch McConnell at the wheel and couldn't get it done in 4 year's so they tried to force him into a second term to finish us off.

@k.s783,"Omg, stop making shit up about conservatives, there’s no evidence of conservatives being racist, white supremacists or nazis. There’s always crazy people on the fringes of society who claim to belong to the party but don’t actually represent the party. 

How convenient to leave out extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and their role in the Jan. 6th riot in your propaganda piece. 

There’s evidence showing they were the section of the gathering that had actually planned on entering and came prepared unbeknownst to the others in the crowd who you simplistically described as being a single entity. Wow, how nuanced of you! 

Trump’s speech didn’t trigger or motivate people to invade. Read the actual post. It’s available for you to read! Does it say to invade the Capitol? No. 

People outside the Capitol shouldn’t be grouped together as a monolithic extremist group. Clearly you did an awful job at actually weeding out who committed crimes vs happened to be present outside. There seems to be zero attempts at actually created anything resembling an objective account of events. 

The Oath Keepers are an anti-government group, in other words these aggressors were not even true Trump supporters but right wing extremists. They said Trump wasn’t doing enough! (Google Oath Keepers to confirm). 

I couldn’t care less about Trump, I never liked him. However, I do care about the labeling of 80 million Americans as racists and Nazis. It’s simply false and unethical to make up BS like this. Prove it! Show what the government policies are that are racist! You can’t, because you’re a propagandist and a commie liar pretending to be objective. 

Not a single leftie complained when every major American city was on fire in 2020 —criminals running wild and police in retreat.

No leftie cared in 2018 when rabid feminists descended on the Capitol to protest Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

And no leftie cared in 2017, when a deranged Bernie supporter targeted the Republican Congressional baseball team’s practice, shooting Rep. Steve Scalise.

When it’s your extremist counterparts on the right reeking havoc the Left has something they can use for their political agenda. This short documentary is an example of that and it’s so full of falsehoods it should be flagged as disinformation and propaganda, because that is what it is. 

You’re not going to change the world through lies and smears. It doesn’t give you ANY credibility rather it gives people a reason to dismiss you completely.",1,2023-06-03T00:58:32Z,2023-06-03T00:58:32Z

To these people getting the familiar clown back in power was the only plan, if any (""better the bad one known than the better one unknown"", or whatever that goes).
Biden is not showing any progress in that regard. He doesn't have a clue, or the stamina, to overcome the real power behind the presidency.
Republican or Democratic are as different as any other country's two parties, nothing too American based about it.

Today we have, all over the world, not only in ""Amurica"", the same kind of realities. The very people who suppose to represent us is working against us in a clear bold way.

@AlexDrums482,"I really don't like the take that there can be no social or legal consequences for violent insurrection because it might set a precedent for government crackdowns on ideological groups. This isn't a slippery slope. You have the right to organize and speak your ideas, even if they're pretty radical. McCarthyism is dangerous and un-American, but accountability for people who participated in a violent coup attempt isn't that. It's completely appropriate and necessary. 

And Trump voters are not good people. We need to stop infantilizing them. They know exactly what they're supporting, and it has nothing to do with economic anxiety. Their living standards didn't improve a bit under Trump, but they will suffer happily if it means having an openly racist administration that greenlights and legitimizes all their hate. They only talk about economic concerns when Democrats are in office because they want to couch their criticism in something that sounds reasonable, but it's not what drives them and never has been.

This event was our neighbors and US citizens. 

 I don't own a gun or ever want to but on that day I kind of wish I did for that moment.  I was scared the riots would replicate in every city and they would raid houses. The mob mentality looked confused and like they could do anything.

So what is your point??? I agree with you calling it the dumbest day.

@earthjustice01,"This is the second video I've watched from secondthought.  I really take issue with your oversimplification of the political scene, your equation of the two political parties as equally complicit in allowing corporate malfeasance.  It's disingenuous to claim that the democrats benefit from not being able to legislate when they would be far more popular if they could get legislation passed.  Just imagine that they were a parliamentary democracy.  There would be no question that a simple parliamentary majority could pass any legislation as long as it was legal.  The problem here is the corruption that has come about because of the weaknesses of the U.S.  political system.  Having a nonrepresentative body like the Senate be the gatekeeper for the legislation drafted by the congress, and further,  the requirement of a supermajority of sixty percent to avoid a filibuster is a recipe for political stagnation.  The Republican party is now full of opportunists who are exploiting this flawed system in order to seize permanent power.  This would be much more difficult to get away with if the U.S. was a parliamentary democracy.  It's the political system that's at fault.  That's the reason for the extreme polarization as well.  As long as you have an unrepresentative political system it benefits the Republicans to support and encourage right wing extremism.  Look at the character of politicians - so many of the Republicans are con artists and grifters.  The Democrats are more dedicated to upholding principles of democracy.  The Republicans are nihilists.",0,2022-01-19T06:56:13Z,2022-01-19T06:56:13Z

@eliasholmes9467,"This is an old video so you can be forgiven on going by the information you had at the time.
That being said, we now know that there were feds amongst the rioters.
We also know that they were let into the building because police literally pulled the barricades out of the way for them.
We know that feds are notorious for egging people on to commit acts of terrorism that they promise to support.
Then, when those people decide to act on those beliefs, the feds swoop in and pretend they busted up a terrorist plot that without them would have never taken place to begin with.
This happened multiple times in the wake of 9/11 to angry Muslims that were tired of always being looked at as terrorists.
We also now have video of some Trump supporters asking the police why they were doing nothing because not all the protestors there entered the building nor even wanted to and wondered why the cops were refusing to do anything but stand there.

January 6th was allowed to happen because the deep state loves nothing more than to put even more restrictions upon the poor and working class.

This is in no way excusing the fascists amongst the rioters.
I'm a leftist who is sick of the fact that leftists seem more bent on making sure people use the right pronouns, comedians keep their jokes respectful to trans people, and that Hollywood has diverse enough casts in movies and TV rather than actually fighting against the ruling class.

All that being said, I really don't care if those folks went in there and killed every last one of those corrupt pieces of shit both Democrat and Republican.

The politicians in Washington D.C. knowingly and without hesitation make decisions every single day to murder people in this nation through things like maintaining the for profit ""health care"" system and also through the war machine overseas.
Millions have died and billions suffer in poverty every day in this world because of the decisions those people make.
So, I could not care any less if any of those horrible, narcissistic, sociopaths and psychopaths get strung up by their feet from the rafters of the capital building.
I won't shed a tear and may actually cheer.
Not sure yet.
They deserve absolutely nothing but the worst that can possibly happen to them and it's time that everyone stop acting and speaking about them in such a civilized way because civility, decency, and humility has nothing to do with how they conduct themselves on a daily basis and the actions they take.

""Civility"" is nothing but a game that the ruling class play to cast people who stand up against them as unhinged and violent while they sign off on coups and wars that kill millions all with a smile.
If that's what counts as civilized then count me out.

We need a revolution.
Every revolution in history has started with a profound hatred for the murderous narcissists in charge and if we are to have one in this nation we need to feel the same about the ruling class here.
Also, everyone always talks about a revolution but no one really wants to talk about the fact that revolutions result in deaths.
No one wants to talk about how any revolution will have to involve breaking the laws the ruling class put into place to protect themselves from the poor and working class.
You really can't have one without the other.

America either needs to get serious about revolution or sit down, shut the hell up, and accept increasing poverty, suffering, and more restrictive laws on things like free speech and protests for themselves, their children, and their neighbors.

Say what you want about these right-wingers but they got closer than anyone has to actually making the psychopaths in charge shit themselves more so than any leftists have in a very, very long time.

The left needs to start taking notes from those people and start looking at actually having the guts to stand up against this murderous insanely corrupt system before it's too late.

The left needs to start arming themselves and protesting with guns.
A black militia down south did this and not a single cop tried anything out of line with them.

@Mr.Nichan,"I would agree that democracy is not the core objective. It's just practical. Politics is too complicated for anyone to really understand, so more wisdom would lead to more competence. Majority rules spread over the general populace does not lead to the wisest decisions, but it is a good way of ensuring government does not lose touch with the goals and values of the most people affected by the state, which is always a threat when democracy disappears. The whole problem of big money swaying elections through advertizing and people reelecting politicians who lie because they believe what they hear and are convinced by propaganda demonstrates the problem of lack of wisdom among voters on average. Also, even if this problem did not exist, freedom of minorities (or minority interests) from the tyranny of the majority (or majority interests) is generally more important than majority rules, anyway.

Capitalists (pro-capitalism anti-communism people) frequently fearmonger about socialism by saying that socialists want to trade freedom to make their life easier (and also that it might backfire and create or entrench huge inequality like in North Korea or apparently China). While that trade may be justified to some extent, we should definitely not support a form of socialism that would make these fears come true. For example, democratic, or even undemocratic non-profit, governments may run big industries in a way that is more beneficial to people than the plutocratic way they are run in capitalism, but that's also combining the power these corporations had with the more directly dangerous power governments already have, increasing threat government poses if it becomes your enemy to greater than what either big companies or the government could do separately.

(I can already predict someone's going to tell me they aren't separate now, just because big money influences politicians, but even then, at least corporations fight each other when there aren't common interests like fighting government regulation or anti-corporate sentiment.)",1,2021-09-02T02:43:15Z,2021-09-02T02:43:15Z

@Devi8Nation,"I watched this on C-SPAN live. For those of you who don't know this is a media outlet that for the most part  provide live coverage without the talking heads constantly telling you what to think. 

Their feed was live as people stumbled through the Capitol building. They then began to allow individuals to call in and share their thoughts and opinions on what was going on. What preceded could best be described as 45 minutes of individuals calling in and either regurgitating their sides nonsense And people desperate to say they do not subscribe to the system in which allowed this event to occur.

The previous day I worked a 24hr shift, this is standard for most public sector  ambulances. Because we are usually on standby we have a chance to sleep. But that particular  shift I had no such luxury. Because our cities two fairly large hospitals needed to transfer critical Care patients due to them not having the capacity. We transported from the Dallas area to Oklahoma City three times that day. All three patients were on ventilators. Requiring constant monitoring because bumpy roads and tubes down airways dont mix well. All while pumping them full of anesthetics and paralytics. These patience won't even be able to remember this $8k+ road trip. 

I came home to see this circus storming the Capitol building. I sat there in my work clothes and actually shed a tear at the site. My fiance is a registered nurse, we rent a 700 square foot home. Because we both have student debt. We want to pay that off before taking on a mortgage. 

These people stormed the Capitol building like it was 1812. For the man that did almost nothing to prevent those three patients from being in my ambulance, with a tube down there esophagus. All while these individuals who have the luxury of being able to skip work to participate in what is essentially idealistically exasperated tourism. 

I lost the last bit of pride I had left for my nation that day and the older I get the more I realize there was no reason to in the first place.

@TastyLiberalTears,"First off most Republicans are not white supremacists, obviously you do have a political bias. I myself am a constitutional independent conservative. What happened at Capitol Hill is disgusting and stupid but this video is just as well because the supreme Court deemed that Donald Trump did not incite insurrection. The officer did not die on scene, he died the next day from natural causes due to a blood clot that caused a stroke. People who fly the Confederate Battle flag are not supporting racism, they are supporting a pushback against Federal overreach and Federal control much like the Democrats did during the civil war. The Confederate Battle flag is different than a Confederate flag, very similar but different. The Confederate flag as I said and we'll say again is the only time that United States citizens fought for what they believed in against Federal overreach and control. But all is for not because the Confederates wanted to have independent state control which pretty much every state has now... And before anyone says the civil war was fought for slavery? Partially you are correct, Republicans wanted to stop slavery from the expanding into the western states. They wanted to abolish slavery yes, but the United States is not a democracy. It is A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. It is a republic governed by the Constitution with Democratic ideologies such as how the United States takes facets of every other government I.E. socialized healthcare, social security, police force, education system, fire department and many other socialistic qualities here in the United States. The founding principle of democracy is majority rule, that would not work in the United States due to the multiple different lifestyles that are held within the United States, that's why we have the electoral college.

@sheilayungk7815,"I have a friend who is a Trump supporter.  Since Biden's presidency, he constantly reminds me of gas prices going up.  He claims that when Trump was our president gas prices were extremely low due to the Pipeline being open.  To him, this was a good thing.   it created jobs and we were doing our own oil refining.   He is a  Fox News guy.  He will watch the other networks, but he makes them very wrong.  I understand where he is coming from because there is a lot of propaganda in the news (especially Fox, which he also doesn't get).  However, if I show him anything I watch on Youtube he calls the shows I watch  ridiculous and the people on them morons!!!  I have given up sharing anything political with him.   I know that the Oligarchs rule and the planet needs help.  However, he doesn't get it.  He is extremely fortunate.  He worked as a train engineer, driving  the trains in NY, and gets an incredible pension.  Who knew that working for the transit authority could be such a lucrative job!  Don't get me wrong.   He has worked hard and put his time in.  He did this while he suffered a disability for many years. He truly deserves what he has.  He feels that Capitalism is very important and thinks it's great if people make billions of dollars.  ""That is their right as an American"".  ""They worked hard for it"".  It doesn't affect him at all!!!  I'm sure if it did he would think differently.   I am on the side of the working class.   I have worked for a University for over twenty years.  I was getting paid less than someone who had a High School diploma and I am almost a college graduate (4 yrs.  I never finished).   Also, she received 100 hours more of vacation time than I did.   I found a lot of things unfair working for a university, but I am grateful that I will be getting a pension.

You talk down to a group of people for four years calling them deplorable, racist, and nazis don't be surprised when they get pissed off. You left out the fact that blm members were also arrested.

Did you make a video about all the blm and antifa actual murders that went on or, hell, may be still going on now. This is nothing compared to that.
I noticed you also conviently left out the fact that democrats have been inciting this since 2016.
Wait and see what 4 years of Biden does to the country and maybe you'll understand why these people wanted trump to win, which he did and to say there is no evidence is a straight up lie.

@MatthewSmith001,"We need a new and completely different government. The one we have has failed us.
Second (first is at the end): we need to get rid of the ""bipartisan"" bullshit. The only thing it's good for is gumming up the works and creating drama to keep us blinded to what the hell is really going on. Ted Cruz fled a freezing state he supposedly represents to vacation in CANCUN! No public servant should make enough money to fly off out of the country whenever the fuck they feel like it. ...All income of public offices need to be severely decreased to a cost of living ratio. Even the President. (An odd piece of trivia: the highest paid gov't office is an administrator in the EPA--not even the head figure of the EPA makes that much--$750,000 a year. The muddy waters of corruption in this country run REALLY deep.)
Next, anyone who's elected to a position of so much power needs to be monitored 24/7. They should not be afforded the rights that they swear to protect. Public cams should follow their every step, the footage of which should be available to public access at all times. While in office, the payment they earn should be held in abeyance till they leave office. The gov't pays for their housing and transportation--they should all be issued small hybrid vehicles whose mileage is constantly monitored and made public. They'll be afforded a daily or monthly stipend for food. When America runs out of food, they will too.
Next and most important: every politician in DC should be arrested and thrown in a military prison while every aspect of their lives are investigated and their bank accounts turned inside out. Any bribe taken or ""gift"" accepted from the rich elite will be found and both parties punished. Any ""Senator"" or ""Congressman"" who owns more than one home should spend the rest of their lives in prison. They were elected to help others, not themselves, and abusing that power is an offense of the most egregious nature.
Next: no individual--PERIOD--who owns stock should be eligible for ANY candidacy. That opens up too many avenues to corruption. Honestly, if one of them even tries, they should be immediately imprisoned while they're investigated. This a country of people, not principalities.
Next, any law that's been passed for the sake of a corporation will be overturned and that corporation fined a crippling amount of money. Companies will be indubitably barred from approaching lawmakers, and if caught making the attempt, that person, the CEO and CFO will be arrested promptly. Punishment for these types of transgressions will face severe repercussions posthaste, no more ridiculous rights to representation. In fact, if they make over $200,000 a year, they won't be allowed. That'll force the uppercrust to toe the line, permanently, not when it suits them to lie to the people.
And speaking of corporations... every company on American soil will be invaded by the National Reserves: every invention or creation that a company stuffed in a dark closet for the purpose of making money off inferior products that are designed to fail or medicinal cure purposefully withheld to make a profit off a perpetual ""treatment"" will be brought to light and the company abolished, it's assests liquidated for other companies to do a better job, or face the same fate. CEOs will be thrown in prison and impoverished for those sins brought to light.
Next: humanity is technologically advanced enough for the entire country (the whole world, really) to go green. The east and west coasts can run on 100% tidal power. All the companies lack is the incentive. Giant, crippling fines will abound until they've done their duty to mankind. All landlocked states can run on solar, wind, and geothermal power. The energy companies will be given a 2-year mandate. (There are of course exceptions, which will be taken into account. For example: Denver CO can't harness wind power because of their geological placement in a valley surrounded by buffering mountains. But we're smart enough to think up something.)
The rich elite: they evaded $5 trillion in taxes for 2018 and have worked tirelessly to defund the IRS, at which they succeeded. A normal person would serve time in prison for these transgressions and they will, too; no matter where they run, our military will find them.
That $5 trillion? That's where our free insurance will come from. We are the last first-world country (and if you look closely enough, you'll realize America doesn't fall in that category--that's right: our quality of living is so poor that we're a second-world country now) that still doesn't have free health care.
And first of all: we need to shut down the federal reserve. 
So... suck on that for a while. BTW: please circulate this post on any and all social media outlets in which you engage, even if you hated it and think I'm an idiot. I hate to be a doomsayer, but this is--literally--the only way to save our country.",0,2021-02-21T03:25:20Z,2021-02-21T03:25:20Z

One thing I agree with the no fly lists and treating Americans like Terrorists has shown us the government has gone way to far here, and we let this happen by not narrowing and not making a better law than the Patriot Act after 9-11. 

 The government needed to go after (and needed the tools) to hunt down Al Qaeda and Isis, I will never agree that they should be treated with kid gloves because they are real Terrorists in this world. However BLM did have many supporters and protestors whom I agree were harmless and are not Terrorists.  But some of their members, though few, are at least criminals and nothing from Antifa is good, I would label at least Antifa as current Domestic Terror group but I again believe we should be very cautous and stand up to if not stop the Federal government's abuses of their power and their authority. 

 The rioters on the Capital were dead wrong, and I was completely against violence in every way and did NOT support their actions.  However I am angry at many of our rotten political class and believe for decades they have been getting away with murder for years enriching themselves, and increasing their power at the expense of everyone, the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor period. 

 And no I do not agree with and I will take issue with this narrator's claims that drone strikes or comando raids against Isis is a form of Terrorism because its not.  The US president is justified in destroying those organizations, and being very intense and brutal doing so because the more arrested, jailed, or out right killed members of Al Qaeda and Isis means more innocents in the world will survive or be avenged. 

 DJT was not a Terrorist, and no sorry I do not buy into the scheme of MSNBC & CNN that he planned and wanted the riots to happen at all.  The entie thing was out of control, he did not handle things well at all and his pain in losing warped his ability to at least attempt to end it earlier.  But he did not say nor want anyone to harm any person at all in the Capital, much of the chaos and violence was preplanned as the bomber hooded guy in the dark video survalience showed us it was. It mattered not in reality what DJT and Mayor Rudy Guiliani said, nor did their claim of fraud matter, the riot was what these crazies and trouble makers had wanted and planned all along.  

 We see with that poor guy at the airport the US government and bad actors in society or in the FBI have now crossed the line (maybe they did after 9-11 too? I do not know) and they have now or attemting to turn society into a police state first by using this riot as their excuse dejour to push their agendas, and capture or police their enemies.  

 This is not what a Constitutional and free Republic is supposed to look like, and for many reasons which include policies but honestly the main reason I backed DJT (yes he is a naughty boy) was because I know how disgusting and rotten ghouls like Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Joe are.  They will turn society into Hell and ruin these next few years, so my party the GOP needs to get its gears in order and fix itself.",0,2021-02-19T08:51:54Z,2021-02-19T08:54:27Z

@MoneyShot033,"Actually, there is plenty of evidence of fraud so people can claim that the election was stolen, the mother of the police officer actually came forward and stated that her son didn't die from being beaten with a fire extinguisher and it was due to a severe health condition that he had, that Jaden X kid that created some group called U.S. insurgency or something like that was at the Capital Building giving a speech to a group of people and he is known to be a member of BLM as well as ANTIFA.  I am pretty sure he wasn't giving a speech about removing Trump and "" burning this bitch down"" to a group of Trump supporters.

@suzannesund4595,"A narrative of lies. Antifa was escorted onto the property by MDCP several van loads before Trump even finished his speech. Ashli abbot wasn’t murdered. She was an actress hired by the democrats to start the mayhem and get herself shot. I saw it all on a frame-by-frame analysis. You ought to look for it and give it some attention yourself. 

No one is perfect. I’m sure there were some real stupid Trump supporters that walked into the Capitol Building. But, not nears as many as the complicit police and guards of the Capitol Building. They opened gates and invited them through the doors. There were so many actors there, tone of video footage was available until YouTube took it off. 

This is a perfect hijacking of The United States of America by the democrats. They’re heathens. And every single one who participated in the illegal activities in the general election will be brought before a military tribunal, convicted and either shot by a firing squad or hung for treason. That includes Almost every single member of Congress, governors, election commission members, and Secretaries of States in every single state who blew our election system apart. 85-90% of government is complicit.

@genewilliamsmusic,"The guy who made this video mostly has it right, but he is wrong when he says it was not a coup attempt.  Just because it was unsuccessful and not well-organized like a military operation does not mean it is not a coup.  Trump called these people to DC on the lie that the election was stolen and he had them march on the capitol to stop congress from accepting the election results.  At the same time, he had his GOP congress members doing everything they could to slow down and derail the process. So you had complicit congress members and the mob working in tandem at the same time with the same objective.  Both were directed by Trump for the purpose of overthrowing the election so Trump could stay in power. And you don't have to imagine anything or connect the dots to reach that conclusion.  It is all quite simple and in plain sight, as are most of the bad things Trump does. End of story.  The only reason the guy who made this video doesn't get it is because he thinks too much about it.

the one thing i do think needs highlighted more is the action of the proud boys duirng the events of that day.  they have been pretty clearly shown as coordinating with each other and leading, as well as initial and cobtinued instigation of the rest of the crowd that day.   the proud boys clearly had an adgenda and a premeditated plan of action prior to arriving in sc that day.... so while the  majority of the crowd were there just for a fisher price, my first capital riot type of romoer room rich asshole fun  without much plan of attack, imo, it needs to be highlighted just how much the proud boys were leaders of the entire tire fire and associated shenanigans that day.... i mean, they are clearly on video starting to riot while pretty much everyone else were still at the trump spectacle down the street, so they need to have the lights shown brightly on them.....

@Salsmachev,"Uh did you just try to define fascism without mentioning capitalism? Fascism is better described either as the merger of the state and the corporation or as capitalism in crisis shedding its liberal pretensions. Nationalism, reactionary nostalgia, and the persecution of religious, ethnic, and racial groups all follow from the relationship between the (authoritarian) state and capitalism (in fact this is arguably what created the uniquely American flavour of white supremacism we're dealing with today– after Bacon's rebellion, the capitalist class actively created a racialised underclass to ensure that Black and white workers would never find class solidarity). It is possible to be a reactionary, nostalgic nationalist without being a fascist. Many modern liberals fit that description, arguably even the democrats. This is not to say that nationalism and reactionary nostalgia aren't things associated with fascism that fascists need in order to be effective, but they're not the core of what makes a fascist a fascist. It's actually kind of weird that you didn't make this part of your argument given its relevance to chapter 2 and the bourgeois/petty bourgeois character of the rioters.",0,2021-02-09T04:24:28Z,2021-02-09T04:24:28Z

@douglasblowe805,"I am a Moderate and Independent. I have now voted in I think 12 Presidential elections. I vote for the person I think will do the best job. I voted for Obama and he did a good job despite the GOP blocking him constantly. I was not a Hillary fan but did vote for her because I believed she would be better politically for the country. When Trump was legally elected, I said like always, I will give him a chance. 3 months in I was already sorry.  I taught history in public school and college. I have 3 degrees including a Masters in History Education and Psychology. I never let my students know my religious or political beliefs. I take the opposite side in any discussion. I am not a huge fan of Biden but he was legally elected and I will support him until and unless he screws the pooch. 

I did start posting that I believed Trump would try to seize power and overthrow our way over 4 years ago. I still believe he and his worshipers will keep trying. I am still afraid we could face a civil war. I think we are going to see more than a little open violence. I am not shocked by the absolute stupidity of Trump's worshipers. We need a Moderate Party to stand against both the so-called GOP and Democrats. This coup attempt scared me badly. My little sister even armed herself. I stand with the Government as long as it at least tries to protect our nation. I agree that Trump has done his best to destroy our alliances, he has linked himself with Totalitarian states around the world. I honestly think he believes that America is a huge company he bought and now owns. I also have seen how nearly every move he has made internationally has benefited Putin and Russia and weakened the country. 

We are close to becoming a police state. That happens when you allow armed police who get less training than certified plumbers to walk around and enforce the laws as they see fit and even make up laws as they go. If we do not start forcing all cops to wear body cams that are on all the time that they are on duty and then put the tapes in 3 places 1) the police station 2) the DA office 3) an independent watchdog group and then jailing renegade cops who step over the line, we will continue on the way to a police state.

@woody020354,"n Sicknick's case, it's still not known publicly what caused him to collapse the night of the insurrection. Findings from a medical examiner's review have not yet been released and authorities have not made any announcements about that ongoing process.
According to one law enforcement official, medical examiners did not find signs that the officer sustained any blunt force trauma, so investigators believe that early reports that he was fatally struck by a fire extinguisher are not true.
One possibility being considered by investigators is that Sicknick became ill after interacting with a chemical irritant like pepper spray .
or bear spray that was deployed in the crowd. But investigators reviewing video of the officer's time around the Capitol haven't been able to confirm that in tape that has been recovered so far, the official said. The case could also be complicated if Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition. It could not be learned if he did.  From 03 FEB 2021 CNN article:  https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/02/politics/brian-sicknick-charges/index.html",0,2021-02-08T05:47:03Z,2021-02-08T05:47:03Z
@woody020354,"""One officer (Sicknick) was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and beaten to death by the mob.""  That is pure conjecture and a story made to fit the Liberal agenda. Officer Sicknick died the following day at his home, not at the Capitol.  There is no video footage showing him being hit with a fire extinguisher nor any medical report or photo of head bruises/cuts.  The death was over a month ago and the autopsy report has still not been released.  So before reporting something as the truth, first be able to prove the facts.  https://www.foxnews.com/us/capitol-riot-brian-sicknick-death-investigation-no-charges-autopsy-results-pending",0,2021-02-08T05:29:05Z,2021-02-08T05:29:05Z

@agnesi8690,"Don't completely agree, but at least your pov is well-informed, regarding the huge umbrella on the right. 

This was a failed coup, simply because there were factions within the government (in Congress, in LE, and in the military) supporting the movement of the mob. 

Also your characterization of Joe Biden is not fair nor is it accurate. He is a centrist. He's not selling snake oil. He is selling the status quo. After the last 4 years, the status quo is the safe bet for millions of Americans that fear the economic instability that four more years of Trump would bring. 

Also, tell me of a society where the elite are equally as influential as members of the working class, so I may move there. Such a society does not exist. 

But overall, a very good analysis that is far more helpful than most mainstream analyses. You really went into the various groups and the symbolism and I think that is an incredible service to your audience.",0,2021-02-07T22:08:31Z,2021-02-07T22:08:31Z

Would the violence have increased? What if the crazies with mental issues had found their targets? would they have acted out their thoughts to the full extent. We will never know as this is now history but the ability for this event to have been MUCH MUCH worse is EVIDENT!!!,0,2021-02-05T23:17:11Z,2021-02-05T23:17:11Z

@togsog4101,"From my Eurpean point of view, the Trump republicans have all right to think the election is rigged. Why? Because since Obama won his first election as PotUS, the republican governers redraws the voting destricts(aka gerrymandering) so that no democrat should have a chance to get PotUS and this have being done over 12 years. 
After this long period of time it should be guranteed that only republicans can get elected as president. And now this mess, the easiest solution is the election is rigged by the democrats. Some part of the truth could be that a Donald Trump said a lot of negative things about John McCain at an election rally in Arizona, after which no one cheered to him anymore - there was silence. You find enough videos about this on YT. 
This could be one of the points that had cost him Arizona. But to say we (republicans) was to selfish we spit on our own voters, would be to say the republicans have done something wrong. (Will never happen.)",0,2021-02-04T18:26:40Z,2021-02-04T18:30:21Z

I saw live coverage, amateur and professional journalistic video footage with analysis of stills from more than one news source. Now why can't there be a full, accurate analysis including ALL the facts? Suppressing the facts is an automatic invalidation. Blah, blah, blah...if you want the 80,000,000 people to take you serious change out the false scales and bring a just one. Measure EVERYONE'S words and deeds with fair, equal weights. False scales are dishonoring. Just do a body count and accurately add up all the damages and loss of life caused by hired rioters (total rioting deaths in the 30's) last year in our cities. By refusing to mention all groups, you are adding to the imbalance of unjust scales. One thing I have observed about this universe...the very cosmic thread and fabric does NOT support unjust scales. We will all be weighed and measured. Mete out injustice and you have swung wide open the door for injustice to search you out and measure you unfairly. It may take some time, but one thing you can be 100% certain of, your unfair measurement of another human being will find you and unleash your injustice on your own head. It will come at the WORST possible moment.  This could have been a truly excellent analysis. Instead, its a common, dishonoring measurement with unequal weights and reaks of injustice.

@andrewlamothe2533,"Agenda driven dog water video. It’s pretty clear you’re a Trump hater. Those violent assholes were not typical Trump supporters. To lump the 75,000,000 Trump voters in with the thousand opportunist assholes who stormed the Capital is very irresponsible and blatantly dishonest but that’s typical from lefty’s. We all disavow Nazis and racists. You’re one sided take and focus on the violent minority of protesters makes this an obvious agenda push. By the way you left out the part of Trumps speech where he said to PEACEFULLY PROTEST!!!  How convenient. Also you failed to mention that the violent racist assholes were at the capital building before Trumps speech was over-1.8 miles away. Also convenient that ANTIFA and BLM had been rioting, looting, bombing and torching cities all over the country for the better part of a year however its really the conservatives and Trump supporters that are the violent ones.

There was a time when  judges were vetted, committeed, then voted on like 98-0 or 97-1 votes.  We do need an actual party on the right and left and perhaps a party in the middle that can make governing something that requires consideration, cooperation, and compromise.  Currently, only one party actually wants that. If the Democrats have learned the lesson of the last 20 years. Ask the republicans if they want to return to regular order and if they start playing games again they just move past them like the Trumpublicans have done in the past 12 years and move without them.

@TiqueO6,"Can’t say this enough! By Encouraging the rioters, mid-riot, TRUMP EVEN FURTHER INCITED THE RIOTERS DURING THE RIOT by started his tweeted message reiterating the ‘stolen' election lies!  (The text of the tweet is pasted below.)
 In the text spoke over about 160 words that started out with reiterating the lies about a stolen election while only about 30 or 40 of those words are devoted to calming and telling them to go home. Read it below,

DJT's tweet, sent about 2 hrs into the insurrection, invasion and riot at and inside the US Capitol building (of course the actual video contains the tone cadence and other very meaningful clues as to what he was actually trying to say and what he wanted them to really hear, so both read it and watch the video to get the full meaning):

“I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side, but you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. It’s a very tough period of time. There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home at peace.”

I think this was just minutes before if not during the moments where they dragged one officer down the stairs while beating him with various implements including metal hockey sticks, heavy flag-poles with dangerous metal ornaments on top, what looked like possible knives at some point, what look like bludgeons of all types for an extended period of time.
(There are some photos of people with very dangerous spearpoints on top of their flag poles and baseball bats as flag-poles, these photos need to be part of the evidence as well!)

We all know that if this video-tweet was a rally-speech the paltry, the few and understated words of reason would have been well covered up by crowds' cheering, hollering and chanting at the lies!  It’s the pattern and rhythm that he and his writers know all too well and was exploited even in what should have been an opportunity to quell the riot but actually was more likely to further fire-up the convictions of the rioters, both violent and violent.

As to the effectiveness of the tweet In quelling the violence it will be important to know how many people actually at that event saw that tweet at the time, how long did it take them to finally hear that message? And did they even “get” it seeing that it was overpoweringly repeating the reason they went there in the first place, the lie of the “Stolen” election?!

We have to point out more often and clearly that:
TRUMP ENCOURAGED AND THEREFOR FURTHER INCITED EVEN DURING THE RIOT!

@ricsalas7310,"I agree with almost everything the commentator argues about both parties & especially letting the Republican party die to the trash heap of history because its cause is to protect corporations, the ultra-rich, & to marginalize the working class people with low wages, inaccessible & exorbitantly expensive health care & education. American politics is based on legalized extortion where money & its financial institutions decide what programs, policies, & legislation will be promoted & implemented. The Supreme Court made that horrible decision in ""Citizens United"" that erroneously argued that corporations are persons & that regulating political contributions violates the 1st Amendment's freedom of speech, removing any semblance of accountability & disproportionately unleashing completely the privileged few completely dominating the vast majority of an unsuspecting and badly informed electorate. The breakdown of the documentary's identifying more precisely who the insurrectionists were at the capitol is excellent from small business owners, to military and police, neo-nazis, Republican elected officials, Christian evangelicals & a whole host of white supremacists & groups that had been whipped up into a psychotic frenzy based on lies. The irony by this mad mob was to overturn a democratic election & gift the presidency to an incompetent & corrupt Donald Trump who's policies & agenda is to further enrich himself, family & friends while effectively scape-goating people of color, Muslims, homosexuals, immigrants whether legal or not, & anyone else that challenged his criminal behavior. Propaganda works, almost half of the electorate believe in a fictional world creating an unnecessary crisis where the real critical issues of our time & either ignored or addressed inadequately. Government is necessary in the modern world & because it is publicly funded, it is a socialist institution, assigned the extraordinary power to decide the rules of the game. & it would be ridiculous to scrap both parties. Rather, it would be more practical to take over the Democratic party from the grass roots up to truly become the party of the overwhelming majority. Like Christian evangelicals & so-called Christian conservatives took over the Republican party in the late 60s & early 70s, conscientious, working-class people & a progressive intellectual class, have begin to play a much more important role in dominating and directing the Democratic party. Racism and bigotry have no place in a society created by immigrants and where the ethnic/racial composition of the United States is diverse. That is its strength. & religious institutions have to stay out of politics because it tends to be hostile to science, democracy, & far too often, FACTS.",0,2021-02-02T12:52:09Z,2021-02-02T12:52:09Z

@eschdaddy,"I’m leaving the Republican Party.  Why?  Because it ISN’T the Republican Party.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been called a RINO, (Republican in Name Only).  Funny thing is, everyone who’s called me that, better represents that name than I do.  See, I’ve been a Republican for 3 reasons:  

-  I’ve been born and raised that way, 
-  I’m a military man and that’s just what we are
-  It’s the party of Lincoln, a man I respect in every way.

Since I’ve officially become an old fart, it’s that third one that really appeals to me.  But here’s the problem, the party no longer holds the values of Lincoln.  Don’t believe me?  Which party’s members are most likely to carry the Confederate Flag?  Which party most believes in equal rights to all people, of all genders, races and sexual orientation?  Which Party’s members just tried to sack the Capital Building?  Which Party’s members are most prevalent in the South? (not that it matters, just thought the irony was funny)

I can’t move myself to the Democrats.  But when me, who is right of center, is too far left for the rest of the party, then to hell with them.  I’m taking the values of Abe Lincoln and going independent.  I’m so tired of hearing them cry about how the election was stolen.  IT WAS!!!  By the other 80,000,000 of us who were SICK OF THE DAMN DESPOT!!!  No, there wasn’t fraud.  Do you honestly think the judges, who Trump appointed, were idiots and just didn’t understand what brilliant evidence Giuliani was trying to present to them?!?  No!  It’s because there wasn’t any, other than proof that Giuliani use Grecian Spray-on.  So, the Dems have been crying for the past 4 years.  Yes, but at least they won the popular vote first.

Look, I’ve been trying to get the rest of my Party members to see what’s going on.  It’s what we’re SUPPOSED to do.  Keep ourself in line, so the other side doesn’t have to.  I’ve been pestering my friends over and over, not because I enjoy it, but because they need to see our holes, so WE can fix them.  They don’t want to hear it.  I look at their evidence over and over and it’s all proven shit within 5 seconds after looking it up.  I have a friend, who I think the world of and KNOW they’re extremely intelligent.  My respect won’t change, but I use this an example of what I’m up against.  They took a single tweet of Nancy Pelosi in 2017, which called Trump’s election BS and asked them to seek the truth... or something like that.  The exact tweet isn’t the point.  It’s that they equivocated that one tweet with all of Trump’s tweets, to include the one’s where they cancelled his account, and called it hypocrisy.

So... let me ask all these ‘Republicans’... when’s the last time you looked inside yourself and held your party to account.  Don’t cry about the Democrats.  They’re doing what they do and hold themself to account exponentially more than the Republicans.  The Republicans haven’t done it since John McCain died.  Well, except Mitt Romney a year ago and a 10 Reps this week.  What do they get for it?  Death threats and harassment.  Even for simply certifying the electoral results.

Then there’s the faith part of it.  I know what true Christian values are, despite some assuming I don’t.  I know we should hold ourselves to the higher standard set by Jesus himself.  But how  has anything Trump has done, before, or since his inauguration, been something to aspire to?  

When did the members of the Republican Party become completely devoid of putting themselves in other people’s shoes, to feel sympathy, empathy, or even try?  When did the suffering and death of kids at the border become OK, but family practice clinics not? 

I know the abortion thing keeps a LOT of people in the party.  Jen and I know better than most what that’s like.  But here’s the rub... the states that want to change Rowe v Wade the fastest, are also in the worst position, both financially and socially, to handle that change!  I’ve put a lot of time and thought into the best way to change that law and the ABSOLUTE worst thing you can do is change them before you first do the following:

1.  Adoption reform
2.  Foster Care reform
3.  Child Welfare reform
4.  Ensure safe abortions for rape or medical circumstances.

These changes allows women a choice instead of an abortion from lack of options.  Without ALL 4, the RvW change will result in the suffering of the same people you’re trying to save, ALL WHILE illegal abortions are done by coat hangers in the back alley clinic.  So, guess which Party is most likely to make those changes first?  I’ll give a hint... it rhymes with Remocrats.

So cry about Q-Anon or Pizza Gate or whatever.  I could give a shit!  Those of you who are true friends will understand.  The rest, I could care less about.  For those who don’t know, my wife and I have both been through medical and financial hell, so I’m already used to disappointments and embarrassing my family.  And NO!!!  I don’t want your fucking sympathy.  If there’s one reality I’ve learned from my condition, it’s that sympathy is a God damn curse, which breads complacency and self pity!

So if you think your whining about an election, that Trump legally, ethically and in all ways lost, is going to move me, without providing any type of actual proof that wasn’t created by someone who lost on Smarter Than a 5th Grader... then forget it.  If you think I’m going to remain in a political party that no long represents the values of it’s founding father... then forget it.  If you think you’re going to take my country... the one thing, other than my family, that I care most about, then fuck YOU!",0,2021-02-01T16:15:30Z,2021-02-01T16:17:08Z

@dogden6462,I have an objection to your commentary. And that is you say Donald Trump did nothing for the working class . That is not true . He had brought the economy back up better than the last two people before him . He also brought the unemployment rate down and had more blacks and Latinos working than before he took office . He also brought back more manufacturing jobs to our country  that the ones before us where sending to other country's . All this before the pandemic came into play. He promised to get a corvid vaccine in a record  time and everyone said he could not do and he did . these are all facts . As well as getting a treaty signed that   helped save lives in other country's. And he also brought to our country the real and truthful side to how our other elected officials where using the position in office to become rich with there pushing bills to get big tech company's more power . and other company's like pharmaceutical that poison our people with there opioid drugs and raising prescription drug prices and heath care cost on the low income people that have to chose to buy there medication or feed and house there family's while they get sicker and die . . he was a strong man that stood up to the corruption in our government. And how our elected officials used legislation brought into the house to buy stocks to make them richer . That could be seen to people as it is seen in in the stock market is a crime called insider trading . Also the fact that in 2019 the us became energy independent and was one of the biggest exporters of natural gas . Bringing more money to our economy. And he was given a big task created by or former vice president and Obama of the ice style concertation camps separating family's from there children   But yet you failed to point these things out . Why ? you should make a follow up video of this and please include what bidden has done in less than thirty day in office .He has caused American people to loose there jobs and be forced to go on unemployment . 8000 jobs just on the pipeline project . And he has joined Paris accord climate that will have us sending more money to fund an  some peoples eyes a useless project . That some of the worst polluting country's pay less into He has  done really nothing to help with the pandemic except put a monitory executive order into place that people have to wear mask in government building and on public transport . and then you see the house of representatives and him and other in government buildings not wearing mask . He has  called for us to come together and unify . But yet lets the democrats in his party call people that voted for trump white separatist . I was a democrat for years up till the election and i have seen how the media played a roll in our election as to paint a picture of one person as a bad guy and told lies on things they said he has done and on   the other side hiding the things like with holding money to the Ukraine unless the prosecutor that was investigating his sons company was fired. Hiding that his son was taking money from the ccp and no one can tell you why he is getting the money and having on experience in any kind of business . And then came the cancel culture where if you voice an opion on election s or on wrong doing you get removed from online platforms and surprised for your second amendment right to free speech . they place Trump supports as a radical extremists group because of the capitol riot but let Antifa and blm  burn down city's and police stations and government buildings and they its a movement and help free the people involved and support them saying its not going to stop i worn you its not going to stop even after the election  And go on saying im surprised there is not more violance and protest . If that is not inciting and supporting rioters i don't know what is  I am truly ashamed at the whole political patty they are all have gone to far . And i don't condone violance of any kind and i don't want what im saying to be taken in the wrong context by any means . But i have a right to speak whats on my mind just like the press  Just like Como on cnn and ever other cnn reporter or fox news Tucker Carlson . there words are harsh and and sometimes misinformation . But yet there not suppressed as the American public is being  done . I have now come to make my own  judgement to what is happened here . If there was no fraud in  the election . What was wrong with letting the states that where in question get an forensic audit and let it be done by a un biased company . let the states that kept poll watcher out of the vote counting areas tell us why it was done and that will bring unity to the people not hiding things and repressing the people because you don't want to let the people be trusting in the electoral process . . This whole thing is what is causing to division in our country and if there is nothing to see here and it is fair . then why are we hiding the true results and taking away our first amendment rights to freedom  speech . And ignoring our commitment to a fair and equal justice system . because in court a preponderance of evedance holds up in court . if you have the chance to present it . And election fraud is a crime that should be investigated by the highest law enforcement of the state . I mean joe blow can be served with a restraining order just by his wife girlfriend boyfriend just by her telling a judge theta he call me names and threated to harm my dog or he ran over my foot . And in most cases except in gorga that man has to go to court to defend himself . so why has a 100 signed affidavits been listed as no evedence  So now not only the people in the us have lost trust in our election prosses but have now lost faith in our justice system as well. And not to mention losing faith in our elected officials that swore to uphold our constitution  and the repress the first one on the list . Who can we trust now . The American people that stand by our constitution . I suggest that all people read it and other historic documents and take into heart what they say and read Give me Liberty or give me death and you will understand our god given rights. And we should not let money power Hungary people change it to there ideology . So they can put us into slavery that our people fought so hard to get away from . Again this is not a message of any kind to incite violance or a up rising of any kind . I am not trying to promote any kind of riot or push people to do anything but think About what this country has come to and the thought on how we need to change it . And remember  The Pen Is mightier than the sord  Write or email you reps and govener and the house and let your voice be heard and if you  get no reply do it again and again  our for fathers gave us the right to speak our opions and it shall not be repressed  Thank you and have a good day,0,2021-02-01T12:23:44Z,2021-02-01T12:23:44Z

@Werrf1,"You're wrong about one thing: The Republican Party is not strong. The Republican party is weak and brittle, and barely hanging on by its fingernails. The party's 'leadership' has to appeal to their own extremists to keep any support going, and its the extremists who have all the power, whatever the theoretical leaders might have to say. And this is happening because they have no actual ideas of how to govern, only how to stop Democrats from governing. Remember, the Republicans haven't won the popular vote for a Presidential election since 2004 - and that was on the back of a war. Discount that one, and they haven't won since _1988._

I don't know if the party can be saved at this point. Perhaps we'll see the Republicans fade away into irrelevence, and hopefully see the Democrats split so that the corporatists in the Dems can be the conservatives they desperately want to be, and let the left form a Social Democratic party or similar. But Biden is correct that we need to have a strong conservative party and a strong social democratic party",0,2021-01-31T22:15:44Z,2021-01-31T22:15:44Z

The fact they knew they wouldn’t succeed makes the charge of terrorism even MORE valid.  Terrorists know that one violent act isn’t the goal.  The goal is to instill fear and terror of future violent acts in order to further their political agenda.

The fact that this mob wasn’t violently suppressed by police is more than enough to terrify anyone who depends on the police for protection (i.e. everyone).  Anyone who opposes these people knows that they are in danger and the police will not protect them.  THAT was the goal.",1,2021-01-31T15:03:59Z,2021-01-31T15:03:59Z

@KingdomHeartsBrawler,"""News networks routinely equate communism with fascism, completely ignoring the fact that the US allied with the communists to defeat the fascists in World War II, which would indicate that one is indeed worse than the other.""

Now, I agree with the overall sentiments of this video, but this phrase (and the accompanying imagery) is inaccurate and messed up. You just acted as an apologist for one of the biggest monsters in history. Joseph Stalin tortured and killed MILLIONS more people than Hitler did, and he ruled for far longer. I'd hate to break it to you, but State Communism and fascism are the same in terms of actual practice. Both result in brutal totalitarian dictatorships that ruthlessly oppress the people and commit mass atrocities. You also left out the fact that the USSR was originally an Axis power. Stalin was allied with Hitler at first and helped him split Poland. It wasn't until Hitler broke the nonaggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union that things changed. Marxist thought AS A WHOLE is better than fascism (since there are forms of Marxist thought that are more moderate or even purely academic, while fascism is evil by design), but to specifically use Stalin being one of the Allies as an example of communism being better than fascism is grotesquely wrong and deeply insulting to the tens of millions of innocents that perished at the hands of such a cruel and psychotic man.",0,2021-01-31T14:04:54Z,2021-01-31T14:04:54Z

We could use some educated idiots. Better yet, we need an entirely more educated, intelligent population who are motivated to enact real change. I hold out at least a little hope for the up and coming progressives. 

The thing is, rich corporations and elitists cannot stay rich if there are a bunch of educated poor Americans asking, ""What the actual heck?"" and working toward fairness and balance within the working class and the businesses that live so nice and cozy off of everyone else's backs. Thanks, health insurance, pharmaceuticals, Chevron, Shell, Texaco, every oil and cable company, phone carrier, electric company, Microsoft, Bezos, Walmart, Zuckerberg, etc, etc... The list goes on. 

That the Walmart clan is so disgustingly rich and their retirees are left with zilch should be a crime. Same with every company that exploits their employees. That's the American way. Exploit the working class. 

My 65 year-old-aunt who was pregnant and married at 16, was never able to return back to school because she had to support her family, ended up working as a greeter for Walmart at 55 with zero perks and benefits. She was offered a chance to work as a cashier when they eliminated her position but she didn't want to put up with all of the jerks who shop at Walmart and had bad knees, so she couldn't stand all day. She couldn't get her knees fixed because Walmart doesn't have health benefits. 

Working with the public is rough. The video above clearly demonstrates the kind of men and women you encounter every day at work with the public. The CEOs, shareholders, and other big-wigs sit back in their offices, make phone calls, and count the profits made from the labor of their employees while congratulating each other on being so clever over rounds of golf and country club lunches. 

I'm convinced that college will only be affordable for the elite rich so they can keep everyone else down and continue getting rich off of the working class.

The fact the minimum wage has not more than doubled from $3.25 an hour 35 years ago, while the cost of living has double quadrupled is not right by any means. $17.00 an hour is STILL a poverty wage. Some states barely pay $7.00 an hour. But man, did you see that fancy Congressional label on the hand sanitizer in Pelosi's office?

Unless their *conservative media* gaslighting fear to anger as a steady mental diet is stopped or at least exposed conservatives will never change. The only solution is to clean up that media or perhaps bring back the Fairness Doctrine as a beginning.  Secondly, we need to get MONEY OUT OF POLITICS.  As long as our politicians are funded by corporations, wall street, transnational corporations and elite conservative billionaires nothing will ever change.  And all the loopholes that allow our politicians to enrich themselves and their families during and after their terms need to be closed.  Either that or term limits. There is much irony that the thing these people are supposedly protesting against will now be enhanced by their actions i.e. a stronger police force, stronger deep state and more censorship.

Historic elections were closer to ""democracy"", republicanism, and liberty however distasteful such prospects make modern drones feel: than our elections since the despotic empire established by Lincoln and his Radicals (Socialists) at the expense of the real union of States.
This despotism has progressively been augmented by all amendments starting with the 13th, Supreme Court decisions, legislation, administrative rulings, and callous or even predatory administrations like FDR, Kennedy-Johnson, Clinton, etc.

Place (not cows as that foul Supreme Court Judge ordained) = makes valid: the prospect of a ""democracy"", republicanism, liberty. 
Place (not penises and vaginas).
One to One suffrage is plunder.
Place would preserve (damn) the left and its hellish utopia(s) in Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, etc.
Place would unshakle the people of the land, God's Own, all through flyover country, all through the heartland, all through the middle of nowhere, all through Appalachia, all through rural and suburban America. Place would remove the uneven-yoke that is imposed by the metropolitan-core colonial interests against our people.

Of course, with a Place system in place, the metropolitan colonial-predators would be unable to prosper and maintain the imperial federal system, and the complacent populations of the metropolitan cores.

Place means accountability. One-man/One-vote means extortion (crooked scales, fraud, expropriation, uneven-yoke, repression, despotism, oppression). Biblical extortion excludes Tyranny.",1,2021-01-30T21:26:54Z,2021-01-30T21:26:54Z

Both sides really, all of us, full spectrum. but, the same way social media is preying on our worst human wiring, the media is too and everyone is scared cuz of the pandemic, lockdowns, unemployment & general increased violence. Humans definitely can't be at their emotional best right now and I think that's why we've seen this for the past year. Like Q? That Q stuff twisted people. What kind of minds do cults recruit from? Troubled, agitated, nihilistic, bored. So like, increasingly all of us rn lol Trump didn't necessarily do Q but his egotistical ass walked right into it. We can't minimize how for 8 months there was violence in so many cities around the country, while there were also protests in the name of social reform. That scared people too. Regardless of justified or not, it further put people in fight or flight. I watched more footage of real live Americans dying last year than in probably my whole life. That can't be healthy, ya know? There's always going to be a population of people who hate and are consumed by evil. They come in all kinds and they are getting stressedddd and that's scary. We cannot lump all 70 million people who voted for Trump into the category of conservative or even Trump supporters really. Most people truly land in the middle.

@bencoonen6652,"I got more time to listen. I do appreciate the principle that Mr Second thought has on not wanting the state to have unlimited powers and I also agree that it shouldn’t matter whether it’s against left or right. To me it should be about people who infringe on the rights of others by committing crimes especially if they victimize another in some way. But then he says around 23 minutes that 45% of republicans supported the attack on the capital.  I don’t know a single person who has said they agreed with doing anything illegal who is a Republican or supports Trump and I’ve only heard the opposite on the radio or in more conservative leaning programming.. 

Where is the substance of such a claim? I’d like this guy to name one prominent conservative voice who said they supported breaking into the capital and doing any harm to property or anyone. 

If you’re saying that 45% supported the right to peacefully assemble to let their voices be heard at the capital well that is not in any sense supporting physically attacking anything or anyone. And I would hope that it would be a lot more than just 45%!

I challenge you Mr. Second Thought to back up your statement with names and substance!

OK, I rewatched that part again. He did post some apparent poll. I’d like him to give the details of such a poll? If you ask do people agree with storming the capitol to protest the election fraud and make the lawmakers know a person could construe that to mean do you agree with people having gone to the capitol for that reason? If you don’t clarify in the questioning a distinction between lawful assembly and criminal acts the poll may not be of any real value to as to it’s numbers. 

Talk about 2 thought. You don’t get to the truth until you’ve exhausted all logical thoughts. 

Need to work on honesty and accuracy. If you spread such comments around it will give people who don’t really seem to get or appreciate what Trump supporters really feel of think, and if they think 45% of Trump supporters are willing to get violent with people they think are wrong you may be stirring up irrational fears that are baseless. Why would you want to do this? 

I truly do not believe that number is at all accurate in terms of the 75 million Trump supporters. That would suggest about 30 plus million people willing to exact violence in others.

You really think you got this right?

@politicallil7060,"I'm still trying to figure out what was the grievance.  You gonna destroy your nation's Capitol for a guy who gave you not one dam thing he promised. He gave his buddy a wealthy tax cut and allowed them to remove you from their corporate payrolls. That's who is really sucker-punching the working class.  Took their factories invested in Chinese, Asian and Mexican workers made products cheap and charged you highest prices.  Trump, could give less than a dam about the people who storm the Capitol and he succeeded in making your group of citizens the laughing stock of the world.  Whatever respect or so-called exceptionalism you might have had when going in you lost coming out.  You looked like a sightseeing group gone wild you accomplished not a dam thing other than some TV moments and some home movies clips. When the national guard shows up and the real fighting should have begun everybody went out like the building tour closing hours were just announced. But when this nation gets taken over by a foreign power not one person rushing the Capitol will be put in any position other than a jail cell and they for sure will not be rushing to a fight to defend the nation unless the other side is showing up with some 80-year-old ladies warriors ready to rage war.  All you did was give big brother a reason to clamp down on the freedoms you will one day wish you had.  One side note somebody needs to be charged with 6 counts of homicide, and whether you pulled the trigger or not, facing a felony or misdemeanor you can get a manslaughter or murder charge attached, and no Don to save you he didn't even have the decency to give anybody who stormed on his behalf a pardon which was very much within his power to do. What he did was left you high and dry and a mess for the next man up to clean up.  Both parties are running games on we the people and wondering if we the people will wake up before the game is over.

@SilverPrince_,"I hate it when people actually misunderstand the KEK flag and write it off AS a straight-up hate symbol; it didn't start that way, it got co-opted by these Neo-Nazi fucks.

The actual origin of the KEK flag was supposed to be for a joke ethnicity on 4Chan called ""Kekistan"" (I'm not making this up), because someone found out that there were enough people in /pol to classify and register as one, so the fake joke nationality of ""Kekistan"" was made up. Yes, the KEK flag is modelled on a swastika, but because 4Chan users are retards and think making a mock swastika to trigger people is hilarious.

Of course, despite that 4Chan is entirely made up of autistic shitposters who will say ""nigger"" for a giggle, the media picked up on all this and declared 4Chan to be a wretched hive of scum and villainy (or just alt-right-adjacent assholes, which they aren't; they're just retards). Of course, when something's declared a Neo-Nazi-adjacent hate symbol like the KEK flag, which group of actual scumfucks did you think were going to use it first?

Instead of this misuse of the F word  we expect the normies to get there heads around the obscure ""palingentic nationalism"" which is characterized as a ""better working definition of fascism.""  Go with the imperfect but good enough vocab people already have.  Treating this simple point like it requires undergrad coursework to understand is silly.

Defining fascism as right-wing anti-democratic politics is fine - it is what most normies think the word means.  Right now, this is a thing.  We need a concept to capture ""right-wing anti-democratic politics"" -  Normies think the word for this is ""fascism.""  Just go with fascism.  

Real left politics is not about scoring points in your online debates with Shapiro or Dinesh or Goldberg.  Get out and go work on something practical with normies.  Safe the Palingenetic nationalism talk for your dissertation.

@BlackShogun1,"Dear: Republican Party

  When it came time to protect America you refused when the Alt-Right and the Neo-Nazis came you kept the door open for them. 

When Trump back these hate groups you protected him, a P.R. statement saying you refuse to support racism, then back Trump's hatemongering declarations the very next day. 

Who are you people to accept racism as a political platform? When David Duke supports Trump you did nothing, just give me my Tax Cuts and my Judges Mr. Trump.  

African Americans are being attacked on the streets by Americans for, cooking, sleeping, shopping by Trump Supporters you could care less. 

When Trump broke the law dealing with Russia you protected him again. 

  Meanwhile, the hate groups are getting stronger, Anti-Governments Groups increase, but you Republicans do nothing. 

I say this as an independent voter you have permitted Donald Trump to become an American Dictator to keep your power. 

He Attacked Black Lives Matter for his supremacist racist base, for a Photo Op. 
The Republicans did nothing, Terrorist attacked Michigans Capital you did nothing to stop Trump. 
Trump told the Proud Boys, I'm with you 
The Republicans did nothing. 
The Capital Has Been Attacked and you have settled back and have allowed Donald Trump and his followers to commit treason.  

I say this to you honestly all of you are cowards to the Ameican People. It might not feel that way with the backing of Right-Wing Media, The Power and Money you have gained. 

We all saw it though, time after time watching you allowing Trump to do anything he wanted. 

A police officer has died and yes every one of you Republicans is to blame for his death, Fox News can't help you spin out of this. 

There is no honor, no integrity, or compassion within your party. 

Why do you ignore white supremacy and their organizations? 

Time won't heal this one, you have shown us who you are and we will never forget. 

Never Forget.

@Psiberzerker,"Keep in mind that in cases of Mass Hysteria, people can be there, and do the same things things for different reasons.  Some of them are racists, and were attracted to the anti-Obama rhetoric 5 years ago.  Some of them were at Charlottesville, while others were emboldened by it, but that doesn't mean that we can chalk it all up to ""Racism.""  Incells are attracted to the ""Grab them by the pussy"" message, or just want to see Ivanka in a tight top.  Or AOC.  The leaders, some of them are experienced organizers, and demagogues.  Not Goldfinger, he likes to think he is, but honestly, he's not that charismatic.  The point is that the real organizers know their audienceS.  The simple answer is Fear, but they tailor their message for specific fears.  Different fears in different audiences.  Recent events, September 11th told everyone that if you do this ""The terrorists win.""  However, there's a Xanatos Gambit here, they don't have just 1 Win Condition, especially when many of their followers just want to feel something.  Other than Fear, powerful, important, famous, rich, or just part of a group.  Righteous, a lot of Evangelicals just want to be told they're going to Heaven, or tell other people they're going to hell.  There were Karens in the crowd that just wanted to speak with Congress, instead of the manager.  (Goldfinger was the Manager.  That's the job of the President.)  There is no 1 simple answer, that covers everyone, so you can stop looking for it.  It doesn't really matter if a paranoiac is afraid of lizard men, aliens, or demonic possession.  It only matter that you know what they are afraid of.  So, you can slightly change the same lie to cover them as well.",0,2021-01-28T16:16:28Z,2021-01-28T16:25:49Z

But we do have to start somewhere and if we can at least begin by holding him accountable and set a precedent, that would not be a bad thing. But if we do that, we have to carry on under that precedent and hold all other government officials to account as well, otherwise convicting Trump is nothing more than placation. I also don't believe enacting protections against domestic terrorism(read: white supremacists/nationalists) to be a bad thing, but you are completely correct in that writing the bill in the most vague way possible is just asking for trouble.

The worst thing is that Trump clearly lost the election so it wasn't like these people had any justification at all for being there. I don't like Biden at all but Trump and his supporters are lunatics. And the democrats that were there just to watch the idiotic Trump supporters are just as much to blame. Trump and his supporters have made America and the Americans look like a joke to the rest of the world. I don't know how (even if you're not an extremist) can sleep at night knowing they are Trump supporters. While they not be an extremist themselves they can clearly see all the craziness and unrest that Trump causes. God only knows to what lengths Trump would have taken things these last 4 years if it wasn't for our constitution keeping him from fully abusing the presidential power. And this also should point out one more time to Americans that a Two-Party system does NOT work in favor of the people. Are choices at best are to ping pong back and forth from the two parties. There isn't any freedom during elections because we only have the 2 choices that never change their standings so it's not like you could ever get a really good president that does make good changes b/c the president has to follow what the party wants and not necessarily what the president himself would like to do. It's ridiculous that during our elections we don't have a choice for president of someone who is in the middle of the two parties. An independent doesn't have a chance b/c of how much money and the Republicans and Democrats have to deface and squish a person that represents the people instead of the party itself. It's really a shame.",0,2021-01-28T08:50:22Z,2021-01-28T08:50:22Z

Republicans do not try and take away our constitutional rights Democrats do Republicans repeatedly block stimulus bills because as a country we can't afford them the value of the dollar has gone down drastically. Trump brought thousands of jobs to America, like his oil line, that would have saved the country millions of dollars in train and trucking in oil.

@PuddingXXL,"As a German,  I thank you for your effort. Tbh though, I gotta say that I have no hopes for serious reform in the US. All my hopes relied on Bernie as an independent.. I feel for both republicans and democratic voters because they have no other choice than to swallow big corporate.

I thought our EU parliament was slow and cumbersome but at least they managed to enable policies that allow for a stricter control on rampant lobbyism. 
We also haven't got there and we have similar problems but I feel like we're on the way out.

The thing that worries me the most as a European is that a lot of right wing rethoric is intentionally sowed in Europe.  Bannon set us back about 10 years regarding rhetoric and fanaticism. He unified right wing factions in our parliament and integrated US lobbyist even into the German conservative party.
I hear a lot of American talking points being parroted in Europe which is ironic because they project the failures of the US onto our own system which functions vastly different. It's sad and makes me frustrated as I saw the US as allies and friends. I still do but only for the people living there, the US political system can eat a D***.

A texan friend owns a textile flag company and he said that one of the biggest orders coming in from month to month is SS iconography and sentences like work makes you free (this phrase comes from the concentration camp in ausschwitz BTW. ) 
He recently should make an arm badge that was ordered and it was a literal Totenkopf SS badge. (Skull SS, they are infamous for guarding concentration camps and eradicating ""inferior people"". F.e. they smashed babies against trees to save ammo and considered shooting mothers first as an act of mercy so she doesn't have to see her child being killed.

That is what these guys romanticise about and as a german I want to punch anyone who uses our darkest past to legitimise their scewed political ideology.
It's gross and despicable. My grandma was killed in a camp in Dachau which makes it even harder to see and notice this from a German standpoint.",351,2021-01-27T14:21:17Z,2021-01-27T14:23:22Z

@Theoxuesu,"“Freedom, ""that terrible word inscribed on the chariot of the storm,"" is the motivating principle of all revolutions. Without it, justice seems inconceivable to the rebel's mind. There comes a time, however, when justice demands the suspension of freedom. Then terror, on a grand or small scale, makes its appearance to consummate the revolution. Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being. But one day nostalgia takes up arms and assumes the responsibility of total guilt; in other words, adopts murder and violence.”

@sykeassai,"An interesting and well thought out video.  I can't say I fully agree with all your points, but then I'm looking at this from the outside and don't have your unique insight.

Example: I would say that the Republican party is extremely weak, but I'm using the perspective that the Republican brand has hijacked and railroaded by the likes of the Tea Party and all the other extreme far-right organizations.  But that's all a matter of what you regard as the Republican Party.  Perspective and Context.

As for any government body coming and knocking on your door, you have a right to freedom of speech.  You also have a responsibility as a citizen to challenge anything your government is doing which ultimately harms the general public.  Voting is the primary way most people express their concern, although with your youtube presence, you get to do that on a regular basis.

If the rest of your videos are as well thought out as this one, if they did try to arrest you, then I think you'd be well placed in a court of law to have the judge and jury watch one of your videos and see how balanced you have tried to be.  They certainly based on this video alone have no grounds to charge you with any terrorism of any kind, unless you are out there joining in with protests, although how you'd find the time I don't know.

No, they've been calling for _investigations_ into whether the government was _being overthrown_ for months. Something they were being told they couldn't have because they were wrong, _in_ the wrong (to ask for investigations that their opponents got several years for?), and badbadbad _evil people_ for _questioning_ whether there should even be _questions asked._ It's takes like this that solidify positions. They felt that the law was being subverted in an effort to silence them, and being told ""Shut up, wrong person!"" at every turn didn't help.
Qanon is a whole other kettle of fish, one that most conservatives don't even get or fully believe is even real, but of course conservatives are lumped _in_ to Qanon because it's easier to demonize them that way.

Forget about the dam impeachment; we got bigger problems to deal with. We got to stop this virus and get the economy back up to full strength and we need to use all resources. Let Trump go!!

@bobfrick8250,"Had to listen to it a couple times, but you think that the 2000 election was stolen? 27:50 you say the GOP got their desired outcome?  I don’t think you understand nuance when you say the Republican Party should be disbanded because they are all white supremacists.  Especially since most of the Republican Party have denounced the Capitol riot. And not once in your video about “nuance” do you mention violence from the left that was encouraged by democrat politicians and celebrities for political gain.  And now as we enter into Biden’s first term we get to watch and see the violence continue and the anti terrorism military apparatus be turned inward on its own citizens.  This will have horrific results and benefits no one.  Just because these people believe in something other than you do, doesn’t mean that violence from your cause should be ignored.  Both sides behavior is abhorrent and should be denounced and punished to the fullest extent of the law.  Otherwise we end up with a more authoritarian government.

I can explain this insurrection - and the rise of Donald - through a combination of 1) increase use of robotics in manufacturing, which has increased quality and reduced costs, but has reduced huge numbers of manufacturing jobs; 2) rise of an ultra-wealthy class, small in number, determined to reduce government in size to the extent of ""drowning it in a bathtub"", as Grover Norquist brayed in the 1970s; 3) the inability of progressive Democrats and Independents to deal with the rise of the super-wealthy class, loss of manufacturing jobs; 4) the constitutionally protected echo chambers of Fox News and Sinclair radio, telling our less-educated friends that Donald Trump would be their savior; 5) the rise of the evangelical movement and its attachment to the GOP.   There are ways of dealing with each of these causes, but it is going to be difficult.  I see our only hope in the struggle of a bare majority of Democratic Senators and House members, along with Joe Biden.  Certainly not the GOP, which is now wedded to a Fascist future for America.",0,2021-01-25T00:59:24Z,2021-01-25T00:59:24Z

@whichgodofthousandsmeansno5306,I never liked Trump since day one but I do not place all Trump supporters into one bag or claim all Trump supporters are dumb or nazis etc. He is a really good con man. He was never a good businessman but played one on TV so of course people who only knew him from TV might not know his history. And I can understand a lot of people are fed up and on edge. They trusted this president who convinced them an election was stolen from them. Granted there is no evidence of fraud to that level I can understand that inciting a coup attempt. Just when it is over a lie you lose constitutional protection. Fully explains why Trump and Colludy Rudy vanished instead of leading that march gone south.,0,2021-01-24T23:38:02Z,2021-01-24T23:39:25Z

Commentary includes facts but ignores the truth  that the Republican party includesmillions of sane right of center people with strong values that fully reject uprising like the Trump insurrection.  Same for the Democratic party that is left of center.   Fascists (whatever nuanced definition you make of it) can supersede orderly politics in a democracy when the executive branch is totally bankrupt of actual values and does not represent the vast majority of people.  Definitely the GOP for the past 4 years were DUPED by Trump.  After all, the GOP is the party that brought us the Trump tax cut during an expansion that exacerbated the concentration of wealth in the US.  Sound economic principles exist which (if followed) can prevent this .. A key one is ""counter cyclical fiscal policy"" which  requires no foolish tax decreases during expansions ...which leaves little dry powder for things like ... hmm about about a PANDEMIC!

The president can and should only do ""horrible things"" when the nation is in agreement that it's the right thing to do, or in circumstances where time constraints do not allow for an agreement to be reached, he makes a good-faith effort to make a decision that upholds the moral values held by his country.

@wylieecoyote,"The protest was a legal protest. The rioting by radicals - it does not take many to stir up a crowd = was despicable. Just like the MONTHS of riots by Left leaning mobs in many cities across the country. This one riot has gotten more news coverage than ALL of the other riots COMBINED even though HUNDREDS of people died in them. There were NUMEROUS instances of voter fraud, numerous arrests, postal workers arrested and a house committee that concluded that China actively attacked electronic voting. Where do you get your news from to conclude there was no voter fraud? 
I dont like Biden and dont care for Trump, but it is obvious that the Left have attacked him since he took office. It is sickening that so many people are taking sides and not understanding that we are ALL being cheated by these corrupt politicians.",2,2021-01-24T04:09:30Z,2021-01-24T04:11:06Z
@LadyCoyKoi,"I have a question... it has been in my head since this started... Where were these far-righties when Bush Jr signed that trillion dollar bail out for the bankers while millions of Americans are homeless and starving?  Where were these people when Obama did the same for other elitists in government power?

 I love and respect their need to do what is right in their hearts and go out and fight back, but it is so unfortunate they are targeting the wrong system... they need to redirect their demand for better and available access to the things they truly need and want... which are related to the economic system itself, not the government and who runs it. It is the monetary-market system that has screwed us as a species. Again, the execution of this protest is right, but the target is way off. They should've sends some large number of squads to Wall Street and even to the Pentagon. Attack them where it truly hurts them, their wallets.

 Every King fears the Peasants revolting, because their are more of them than royals. The kings of old knew of this, and so do Pirate Captains, they shared the booty or bounty that was taken. The chieftains or leaders only took 20% to 30% of the bounty and gave the largest slice for the lower ranking citizens to share among themselves, which made having a livable life more sustainable and possible... people were happier because of this shared slices. Modern leaders are so disassociated with the lower classes they forget to share the created and found bounty.",0,2021-01-24T04:06:31Z,2021-01-24T04:06:31Z

I also want to say that while rightwing media and the GOP would have eventually led their followers into this same action. I, personally, do think that Trump took off the safety harness that Rightwing media and the GOP were previously using, and just launched these people at whoever he could in order to stay in power.

@jantjepietjepol,"Great breakdown but i'm having issues with the airport part. 
Yes the Union has called to ad the people  present at the riot to a no fly list but i'm not certain anything like specific targeting of those people has happened. Airports have been having allot of issues with passengers the past couple of months. This is due to the masks. Passengers won't wear the masks in the plane or terminal and then get removed from the plane then the company's add those to a no-fly list. this list is company specific and is not shared. I wanted to push back on the airplort part because it's one of the only industries in America with a functioning union and it has been difficult for that industrie having to deal with the masks.",0,2021-01-23T17:43:32Z,2021-01-23T17:43:32Z

HOWEVER WE WILL DEFEND OURSELVES.
Do you actually believe that the government besides President Trump that is currently in place will do the right thing? When have they ever done that? They're ALL Either DemonRat's or RINO'S seemingly bent upon DESTROYING AMERICA from within, thereby fulfilling Nakita Keruchouve's statement that he (Soviet Union) would destroy the United States of America from within. Well, it sure seems like that prediction has come to fruition here with the Anti American DemonRatic party, the RINO'S and their lapdog's the FAKE NEWS LAMESTREAM MEDIA that constantly pass and promote legislation that benefits other nations and invading populations over actual Americans, thus destroying America from within. There is only one way left for our Constitutional Republic to continue, and it is the same way the founders and author's of our constitution did Revolution, 1776 style. And with the way this country is divided, a 1860's style UnCivil War as well. However, The Tyrant's must be removed, permanently. The time to RECLAIM our CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC is NOW!!!
Our elections have been irreversibly compromised and will never be trusted as fair and impartial ever again without voter ID verifying CITIZENSHIP and ELIGIBILITY. Paper ballots that are not only counted but also verified, MUST be used. However, I don't see that happening under this current demonic governmental swamp that is full of DemonRat's and Demonic RINO's. We really need to just clean house, Period. But if all else fails, then we need to just get on with the purge and RECLAIM the CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC that all Patriot's hold dear... 
God Bless America and God Bless President Trump.
WWG1WGA!!! 
I am a patriot, a Trump supporter and I am stuck behind enemy lines and I didn't vote for any of this liberal crap. When I joined the military I swore an oath to defend the Constitution against ALL enemies both foreign AND domestic. That oath has NO EXPERATION date. 
May God Bless America!!! It is now time for all who love this Constitutional Republic of the United States of America to rise and take a stand! We need to Listen to these Libtarded DemonRat's making threats of violence, and take them seriously and not just dismiss them out of hand. We must be ready Patriot's, as we just may have to lock and load in order to defend our nation from all of these violent Libtarded DemonRat's.
An attack by any of those very DemonRat's would bring a level of civil unrest the likes of which has not been seen since the early to mid 1860's. It would most likely make the riots and destruction that the DemonRat's current anarchists that we can't mention, look like a stroll through Disneyland. Do not become complacent in any way Patriot's as the DemonRat's mean to do us harm! Everyone who loves this nation which is the Constitutional Republic of the United States of America must now rise and get out of the trenches and fight the DemonRatic communistic take over, and now stand up and fight for Our Constitutional Republic like your lives depend on it, because in actuality they just might. This action that we all must now take may very well decide whether or not the United States survives as a free nation or descend into a banana republic he'll hole.
Yes, it is time for the silent majority to wake the Sleeping Giant and be silent no longer.
We must also remember and put into practice this simple fact. ""God helps those that help themselves"". It is WAY past time to "" Help Ourselves"" in this battle we find ourselves in. 
God Bless us all!!!  Let's Keep on Making America Great Again!!!  
         God Bless America.

It is painfully obvious that the DemonRat's and their lapdog propaganda wing the FAKE NEWS LAMESTREAM MEDIA have declared WAR on ANYONE and EVERYONE that lines up against their Warped, one world, open borders, socialistic/communistic ideology/agenda.
Wake up patriots, it is way past time for our silent majority to be silent no longer. And while I and I believe we despise violence, sometimes it can become necessary when violence is brought against us. Unfortunately, it seems to be becoming necessary as the DemonRat's have already begun to perpetuate violence against us. And it is becoming more than evident that violence is all that the DemonRat's will ever understand. The war is here and now, perhaps it is time to recognize that and begin to respond in kind. Just sayin'.
Come on people. Isn't it time to realise that the DemonRat's and their DemonRaticlly controlled sheeple and their terrorist arms such as antifa, black lives (looters, rioters and arsonists) matter along with their lapdog's the DemonRatic FAKE NEWS lamestream media have declared WAR on America, its freedom and freedom loving Americans and the DemonRat's did so a long time ago. 
Perhaps it is WAY PAST TIME to STOP pretending that they haven't declared War on OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC which IS the United States of America. 
Always remember that the DemonRat's, every single last one of them, have turned against The United States of America, becoming nothing but ANTI-AMERICAN, SEDITIOUS, TRAITORS and should now be treated as such. Are you actually surprised by this? You shouldn't be. For a long time now, the DemonRat's have shown that they represent that TYRANNICAL government that the founding fathers warned us about when they wrote our constitution. Why do you think that the DemonRat's fight so hard to disarm the American People by attacking the 2nd Amendment and the constitution in general. It's because the DemonRat's know full well that an ARMED populace WILL NOT get into the DemonRat's train boxcar's willingly. And if you think about it, you begin to understand that it is not just about gun CONTROL, it's not even about CONTROL in general. It is about TOTAL CONTROL. Over ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that ALL Americans can or can't do or say. Does any of this Sound familiar? It should.
It seems like the DemonRat's are the TRUE NAZI'S here!!! We are now seeing what took place in Hitler's Germany during the 30's and 40's and in Soviet Russia during the Stalin era, during and after WW2. Just look around and you can see the same thing taking place right here in the United States right now. Yes the history of NAZI Germany and the Soviet Union is repeating itself, but this time the target is America and the Constitutional Republic we hold dear. We must rise against the DemonRat's and their insatiable desire to control everyone and everything and prevent them from destroying anyone or anything that doesn't comply to their WARPED open borders, one world order, socialistic/communistic agenda and ideology.
Preserve the Constitutional Republic which IS the United States of America!!!
All DemonRatic Libtards and SJW's need to be institutionalized, because as we all know, Liberalism IS a Severe Mental Disorder...
DemonRat's, Libtards, SJW's, SnowFlakes and NPC's along with the FAKE NEWS mainstream media which includes their off shoot ""social""istic media sites aka facebook, u tube, twitter and anything like them.

@PEACE2U-ALL,"One other thing to consider. The rioters are claimed to be white supremacists, bigots, nazis, etc.
Yet Christians are claimed to be among them.

Forget the propaganda about Christianity and false Christian organizations (yes, YOU, Catholicism - the ORGANIZATION, not the CONGREGATION).

What's the main desire of God, as spoken by JESUS Himself as being the greatest and second greatest commandment, of which ALL the Law and the Prophets are summed up in. . . 

Love God

Love your neighbor (fellow human being, or more to the point, human RACE) as yourself.

Racist? What is race? NOT skin color. NOT culture or nationality . . . HUMAN race, reiterated even more in the book of Acts - we are all ONE BLOOD.

THIS IS THE TRUE BELIEF OF CHRISTIANS, AS REINFORCED BY JESUS, THE SON OF GOD, YOUR CREATOR. 

Again, using your own head, does that sound like white supremacist beliefs and thoughts of bigots?

PROPAGANDA, which is rampant through the media, is the real cause of our divisions, spearheaded by a two party dictatorship called the government, who only appeared to offer a choice to the people . . .
WE THE PEOPLE . . . who's hijacked government is Constitutionally OF the people, BY the people, and FOR the people.

But is that what it is today?

Also, Constitutionally, when government ceases to do and be what it's supposed to do and be, WE THE PEOPLE have the right to overthrow it PROPERLY and establish a new one. This won't be done when WE THE PEOPLE are divided.

United, we stand. Divided, we fall.

So the divide and conquer strategy that our pretend Government has been successfully implementing can only be stopped if we will STOP believing everything media tells us, START using our own heads, and STOP dividing.

If we truly are the UNITED States, then we need to BE the United States.

So what are you going to do - be stupid or be UNITED? It's clear who our true enemy is, but we can't unite without YOU, THE PEOPLE.

SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

Is a lightbulb coming on yet?

Socialism, the precursor to Communism = NOT democracy. Just ask Venezuela, Russia, and any and all countries ran by Socialism.

Gun control = overthrowing the 2nd Amendment of . . . take a guess.

Suppressing free speech = overthrowing the 1st Amendment of . . .

@whyme2818,"I see every thing on what's going on. this riot was both Biden's and trumps reversal reverse psychology tactics of both of their paid voters that was offered  hush money for their services to lie, commit crimes and stage this event meaning plotted. as they been plotting on 1 individual for over that person's whole life but ramped it up the last 13 years when they started stealing from him. since they both were caught red handed and put on blast. you seen them (presidents)do nothing but lies and them  trying to cover up their actions and try to put the blame on trump. but i know some of you reading this is lost and confused thats not the people hired. see there is 2 trumps in office that im just finding out. as that other trump they ain't telling you is their victem. that victem is the one that they all robbed  going all the way back to Obama. robbed the victem for all his whole lifes work over and over and devided it out and now have put it all on the stock markets and it has became the highest and the biggest  investment in history in the stock market. $540 trillion especially the highest climb in one year. they been so shady to this  victem they just been persecuting him and paying his family and friends to help target him and now many 1,000's of people are paid   with the victems money  to also help target and slander, deformate his character and don't even know him. but also has other people gaslighting lies about him just to help and have more people target the victem. I know a lot of you commenters are some of those that are hired by etheir of that victems family members or past or present presidents. to mislead their victem with fake videos and disinformation to throw their victem off from the truth and also etc.  the victems brother even told him that he will frame him if he talked. and has been trying to do whatever it takes and so has the presidents. as you seen with this riot event and other events it's trump, trump, Trump.  so why didn't we see the second trump. cuz he wasn't a trump and if he was he was lied to all his life and also he wasn't even in office at all. and the victem is the so called other trump. the one that they've robbed over and over of his whole life's work worth millions and millions but now they've flipped it into trillions. the victem was never aware of being in office whatsoever.  or as a bipartisan president. as he never signed up and  wasn't  informed. last time I remember someone has to be running for president and that therefore they would be aware. so do you see what their trying to do. frame the victem of  who  they robbed and did what all to and wronged. since they got caught putting a implant nuero implant into the victem and by having the victems family steal his stuff not just his work but almost everything of value collections and etc and trying to get him to commit a crime by antagonizing and torture and etc. in many ways I've been victimized. but  they try to say it's bipartisan, to cover for the implant. c'mon now. they rigged all the laws and pretended to sue a John doe for their personal interest.  I bet that victem was John doe that they didn't even send a supena or etc. their is lots of them like over 20.",0,2021-01-22T16:17:52Z,2021-01-22T16:17:52Z

@karieugeni9949,"Fantastic video. I salute you! It’s always refreshing to get the perspective of a free thinker. Even more refreshing to see you got a million subs. I could compliment you forever but I should get to my point...and let’s say I agree with 99% of what you said. The one thing I’ll challenge you on is your point about unity. You said you won’t give an inch on their ideology. Fair enough, I myself wouldn’t budge either on the issues you pointed out. However, that’s not required for unity....specifically unity in the general sense that those who see the pot boiling see the need to turn down the heat. Like it or not there’s very good reason people allowed to be ignorant, misguided a-holes in this country and based on your take in this video it is my reasonable assumption that you’re well aware of why. Regardless of what some may want us to believe and even the dumbest day in America neither their ideologue nor the the people it belongs to are a threat in the sense that they literally must be fought off. If the truth does not maintain here their will be the senseless ruin of many many lives and there will come a day in this country that is so dumb it’ll make this day look like it was an MIT graduation ceremony. Although I would say that currently we are cruising on that trajectory and I don’t see us slowing down...it still is not eminent and there’s a chance it could be avoided but not without a shift in our way of thinking. Something massive has taken hold of our society and we hate each other more now than ever but the key is that the reasoning for the hate is at an all time low. So the question is, how could that be? How could it be that racism as a whole continues to plummet but feels like it’s growing? You could say the same for sexism and prejudice towards gay and transgender. What is going on here? Why do we feel more divided than ever when the truth is we’re actually less divided than ever? I think that sure would make for a good video! I think it’s very clear that the same thing causing this gross inconsistency is the same thing that caused this dumbest day. The answer is simple when you’re on the outside looking in. It has to do with politics and social media, please look into it.",1,2021-01-22T15:48:35Z,2021-01-22T15:48:35Z

I think your own suggestion about the use of Ranked Choice voting might really help eliminate this and have more different parties in the long run. Also here in Canada, our democracy system isn't better as a whole, but one element is, political party financing is way more tightly regulated so is lobbying activities in general.

@Kuhmuhnistische_Partei,"Those rich persons remind me of a song by Georg Kreisler, who was an anarchist Austrian-American cabarettist. He was born in Austria, but his family fled in 1938, because they were Jewish. He never got his Austrian Citizenship back, because he didn't want to beg for something all the Nazi followers got without any paperwork. The song (""Ich brauche nichts"" - I need nothing) is in German, so a quick translation (but not the entire song, just a few verses so you get the idea. I tried my best to make it rhyme):

I need nothing – except my jewelry
which costs millions and that’s enough for me
I need nothing, because there is my house
Twelve rooms, beachside – and maybe my spouse

I’m an undemanding person, you would be surprised
Yeah, there are still my private plane and my horse
Well, sometimes I am in a cruel mood
But who isn’t? That’s not worth mentioning

That one wish - I say it without shame –
That I still have, is still unfulfilled the same:

I wish me a powerful Germany back
A nation which is noticed by the world again
With Gdańsk, the Eastern march and a piece of Poland
Which is all rightfully ours

Only until Germany shows the rest of the world
Where their places are – one, two, three
And then Russia collapses, entire Asia will fall
Only Japan – for some time – remains free

And then our iron rod will finally come
To the Jewish-interrelated Chinese
And then is the hour of German judgement
Until then, my friend, I am at ease",0,2021-01-22T12:13:15Z,2021-01-22T12:13:15Z

@pudgeboyardee32,"Visited by the dhs, and youre still here right? Channel is up, talking about it? Sorry but your comfort is a small price to pay and im tired of anyone conflating comfort with freedom. Freedom to live is the most sacred of rights and i cant begrudge the govt double checking. Im a machinist and double checking is how you save lives. I wish someone wouldve asked the OK city bomber a few questions.

What i really want is an answer to this question: if you dont want the govt or business being watchful for extremism who DO you want to do that? No one? Regular civilians? I'll tell you if its left up to regular people to decide things will keep getting worse. I would love to trust my fellow americans with unlimited free speech but most cant be trusted with unlimited texting. I dont like the idea that this train could run away from us but im also a man of tools and these systems are tools. Tools never start in their most refined state. Improving tools take time, effort and experience. In my experience tools that used more end up being used more safely and effectively. That can and will take time. I want things to be better too but the pragmatist view on this is that america survived mccarthyism hot and cold civil wars and though the road has been long and bloody things have gotten undeniably better. Its an ongoing process that will continue to be unpleasant to lethal. But if unpleasant discomfort is the price most of us pay to stop the bleeding i will take it until someone actually articulates a better way. I havent really heard one yet despite many earnest conversations about it. I hear the complaints and then hammer,""ok i get that but whats better and realistic"" and everybody stops because they havent really gotten that far. Being disappointed and upset is not enough to save us, trumpers just illustrated that perfectly. No plan formed, nothing really changed. The NSA has been up our asses all of us.

I didnt mean to come off abrasive or dismissive but im frustrated too and no one seems to see a way forward. Did you notice i didnt offer up a plan either? Thats because im as lost as everyone else when it actually comes to who can be trusted to do what. I feel like all we're really deciding is WHO gets watched or killed, not whether or not it happens at all. Police or violent mobs, someone is going to die. 

I think we have a human problem not a political one and nobody likes that conversation. I see it gut punch people all the time when i debate folks in public. We all know something is wrong and nobody really seems to understand the whole of it.

All i know is that we cant start having more of those debates with each other until the fear of death is lifted, be it a justified fear or a fictional one. We have to dig deep. If we dont we'll just keep having to dig graves.

@kevlar3750,"What a propaganda hit piece!  You claim everything as fact, and hide behind ""I won't name people"". You pepper this narrative with countless conclusions, without any real, traceable facts.    Well, here's a fact for you. The original Trump Rally was scheduled for 11am. Trump was over an hour late, and kept us until 1:15pm. You purposely left out parts of his speech where he specifically said we should be peaceful and non-violent. So, why did he rudely make everyone hang late?  Because he received intel that several groups, (including ANTIFA) planned to infiltrate and dress up like Trump supporters. The problem is that leftist have been lied to about who we are and how we behave. Go look at ""real"" entire video of the rally. You see a colorful mixture of families with children and grandparents. The rioters at the capitol planned for the true Trump supporters to arrive around noon. so, they showed up ""before"" noon.  Easy to verify. go look at Capitol Police body cam footage and the time stamps.  Trump PURPOSELY held up his true supporters so they wouldn't be injured, or involved.  Here's another FACT!  Trump supporters don't wear black, or helmets, or wave old glory flags, and especially don't disrespect police. We're honestly laughing at your narrative!  Now, one last FACT for now.  Mr Fatigues with Helmet and ""Zip Ties""?  Well, that's none other than John Sullivan, a leader in BLM and ANTIFA.

@ThaBlkRainbow,"You make some good points but I will disagree on a few.

1) I'm not convinced that the some of the Republican party or their supporters are just folks with ""bad"" ideas. 

These ""ideas"" are what America was founded on and practiced for centuries.

Whatever economic anxiety they are feeling it is because they supported the policies that caused it in the first place. Large corporate tax cuts, unregulated corporate greed/power has, ever expanding military power, etc. has been tearing this country to bits since its inception. Republicans and all other parties have long since known that. Yet they still continue to support it.

While the economic policies of Republicans are bad enough, the social policies are even worse. There used to be a time Republicans cared about how all people were treated. Now the Republican party is more concerned about passing laws to go backwards on issues that have since been resolved. Abortions, same sex marriage, same sex adoptions, gender pay equity, etc. 

So these people have made it very clear that they only want economic policy that works for them, a social policy that only works for them, while leaving everyone else in the dust. Fuck them for that.

2) Before there was a Republican party, there were always White Nationalists, racists, homophobes, etc. America was founded and built upon the exclusion of the same groups of people that are marginalized today. That's not a mistake or coincidence. 

The White Supremacy that is tolerated within the Republican party is not ""baggage"" to be shed, it is part and parcel of the American dream. There is no America without White Supremacy. Every attempt to disconnect America from its White Supremacy is always met with White backlash. That's not a mistake.

3) It is no one's responsibility to teach or guide anyone out of their own ignorance.  Everyone is responsible for their own enlightenment. 

When these people want to wake up from their Civil War fantasy, it will be on them to join the rest of us who want to embrace a future that is accommodating to the marginalized and vulnerable. Not the other way around. Until then, we fight on without them.",0,2021-01-22T04:33:53Z,2021-01-22T04:33:53Z

You know, the people who screamed and wailed and burned Nike products because Colin knelt during the anthem, silently protesting police brutality, because they saw this as an attack on America, Democracy, disrespecting the flag, and they literally shat in the Capitol halls, tore down the American flag and replaced it with a Trump flag, and threatened to murder the Vice President; and that's not going into them bringing explosive devices into the RNC/DNC and the Capitol building, or building a gallows and chanting their desire to execute the Vice President.

The only exception to that is elective procedures and the consultations that precede and follow, that is something we do have to pay for. Our health care system has proven its worth and effectiveness during this pandemic. i imagine the reason why such a service is rejected in America because lobiests for the insurance companies and those that benefit from bankrupting the average American would either lose money or go out of business, its just sad that their voices are louder and hold more power than the public.

@ExpressionsofAwakening,"Good summary. As much as I don't like conspiracy theories as probably 90% are based on nothing real, I think it was James Comey who said they are still trying to figure out where was our intelligence. The only report was supposedly that the FBI warned 24 hours ahead of the attack. He said the new director of the FBI was being careful politically so as not to seem partisan. But the fact that there was so little protection on the Capital that day just seems that it had to be on purpose..not that I am a truther but after 911 we lost untold privacy as individuals..and what you say here would be the motivation, more money, power and control to those very agencies with an increase in a police state. And they will justify its for ""our own good"" kind of like the ""masks"" in which they didn't trust telling the truth for fear of the medical personnel not getting the best masks first. Seems understandable but amazing how these government officials think they can make decisions for everyone else ""for their own good.""

@osedebame3522,"Even if everyone didn't go in there with the intent to overturn the election, they aided those who quite clearly did. They are complicit in the attempted coup d'etat. I understand the anxieties of handing the government more power, but honestly what else are we supposed to do? A mob of fascists stormed the nation's capital and they've been attacking people who don't agree with them. They can't exactly get off Scot free. Is Biden really going to try and build an authoritarian state and crackdown on leftists when he only won because leftists realised having Biden enact piecemeal reforms to appease people was better than 4 more years of violent right wing ultranationalist reactionaries? You list McCarthyism as an example but wasn't McCarthyism ended by public outcry and by the Warren Court? A resurgence of something similar isn't unlikely, but if Biden gave lip service to BLM and their cause for months and suddenly turns on them once in office he'd meet a massive amount of resistance,  people who see the parallels between now and the 50s and will stop it the same way it was stopped back then. I do agree that the political spectrum as a whole is fucked, and both parties are too right wing to accurately portray the will of the American people, but I feel that the people who aren't establishment democrats or republicans are being ignored, both the big names and small. Though Bernie might not run again the amount of support he got is astounding and has inspired many other candidates with ""radical"" ideas, off the top of my head, Jamaal Bowman, AOC, Andrew yang, Cori Bush, and so on. If they get popular support, we will see some real change and soon.

@2serveand2protect,"Bullshit! ONE > ""Fascism"" (a word deriving from the Roman ""FASCII"" carried by the ""lictores"") was NOT racist in any way or form. Since Mussolini took over power in Italy Jews as well as all other sorts of minorities were free to do as they're pleased. The ""ideological declaration"" of the Fascist Party was signed by about 2 or 300 people - 90 OF THEM WERE OF JEWISH DESCENT OR JEWS THEMSELVES. They introduced ""racial laws"" only when Mussolini allied himself with hitler in the Second WW (shortly before) and EVEN THEN, although they banned Jews from ""social life"", but otherwise they left them unharmed. It was only during the Nazi takeover of Italy that Jews started being deported ""en masse"". Don't believe it? - check it out on ""Wiki"" or wherever the hell you get your info. TWO > FascistS are pro-authoritarian - YES! - but that does not mean they were  ""RIGHT-WINGED"" - BOLLOCKS!

McCarthy  lasted 4 years (mid-1950 to early 1954).  His efforts were the ugliest, but  doomed to failure because he only had the ability to go after the federal government.

@IN-tm8mw,"Very good overview breakdown, I like to remain centered to looking at all sides objectively with facts and opinions. What i'm missing is a breakdown of Trumps Foreign Policies and tactics, while most say he failed on national/domestic things that help improve the common person, i personally never expected that from him since i know his history of being a business owner. One thing i do give him credit for was bring more attention to China joining the WTO and its effects on the US economy and business practices.  Its something i rarely see the common democrats talk about. Most seem to focus on personal liberties or representation of small parties. I love your final though section, brings into light some concerns i felt when i saw this happen on the news. ""This won't be good for anyone"" or ""What did they hope that would achieve?"" i also think this is a big good that its shown how Big tech companies have power over us.",1,2021-01-20T19:22:10Z,2021-01-20T19:22:10Z

It doesn't matter what Trump has done to them their supports was not shaken.
I don't know what they see in Trump that makes them turned into cultist alike behaviours. It's like Trump is everything for them, more than their parents, I would say.

Just like the same thing in reverse during the BLM & ANTIFA riots most of spring/summer.
You REALLY did have me tho, I was snowed for the first 13-14 minutes & then of course it was pretty blatantly obvious that this was from another Democrat (even if you are a moderate one, since you claim to not like Biden - but I wouldn't worry since I doubt it will be long before Harris is directing most of the White House before long cause I don't think Joe can stand up to a force like her, honestly 😁), & I did enjoy the first 12-13 minutes of this video but once the spin was turned on it was obvious it wasn't going to be turned back off, which sucks - I really was enjoying the no-spin breath of fresh air...

Instead of courteously granting the request, as should have been done, the DNC Congressional members patronizingly denied the request and then, went on global television insulting & mocking the citizens, mainstream media & social media were permitted to insult and race-bait continuously 24/7, censoring peaceful protesters edited out and the fringe were featured.

@PeckerwoodIndustries,"Please heed these words of love. These people are angry because the lives they had imagined, and the dreams they once had were stolen. This crime however was not committed by those to whom their righteous anger was directed, nor was this done to them by some hippie college kid, or the quiet man who mows the local golf course, living now beneath an American sky. No, this crime began 40 long years ago when Raegan began the first in a series of irresponsible tax cuts, and facilitated the cruel devaluation of labor that has decimated the middle class most once knew. This long series of tax cuts pushed thru by the Republican party over the objections of the Democrats always starts out as a promise for middle class tax cuts, but behind closed doors they coldly conspire to give our money to those that fund their campaigns, and high and mighty lifestyles. Oh, yes, they pretend to be the party of displaced victims of globalization, the offshoring of our jobs by the millions, but their words are empty lies, for it is they, and their rich patrons who controlled where those jobs were going to go. Premeditated betrayal of of the American worker, and of America itself as our dollars bleed outside our homeland only to return later to buy up ever more of our industry, and farmland. There is a great sickness here that overshadows even the Covid they pretend to deny, but it is ancient, a sin born of man, that of the craven lust for power over the lives of others, and the naked lust to take from another his gold, both, regardless of consequence, or societal cost. The cost indeed is dear, and we saw it paid in blood, spilled within the very halls of our democracy once hallowed, now despoiled.
    Citizens united, that claims corporations are people too, and antilabor ""right to work"" decisions throughout this country over the last forty years have begun to add up to a total devaluation of human labor, and by direct extension, our very humanity. The massive tax cuts created specifically for the oligarchyparalyzed
    I believe what I say here is obvious to all who choose to bear witness, but never is it spoken by those that should. I then speak these heartfelt words, and will write them countless times to these, my fellow Americans, that they should loose not the arrow of their misguided passion upon those that indeed suffer beside them. I often describe the taxes in Americas golden years between 1945, and 1964, how they were between 91-94% on the rich, and how they now pay only an effective rate of 14%. But today is a day of sadness for lost truth, and the innocence it has succeeded in wiping away with its bloodstained flag. My brethren, no longer let their lies be spoken. Look away from the vision they offer. Seek truth that you may adjudge the harm they have done. Look around you at what they have wrought that their works may be ended, and we may clear aside this moment their evil has caused. Take not the word of any man that you do not look him in the eye and understand his true purpose. Not even me. To those who's eyes are opened, let them stand forth here and now to speak these words of truth, for with these words I charge you to begin your work to which your hand and mind are guided that this may end, and be replaced with the brotherhood of unity restored.

Peter A. Schmitz



The Republican assault on truth has its roots in their sin. The irresponsible, massive, tax cuts for their rich patrons ARE the national debt. It is money borrowed from the future to make the rich richer NOW. This accomplished, Republicans then blame the poor or Democratic party, then hand to us the bill, with interest added. They cannot run on this great crime, so holler on about their god, their guns, the gays, and abortion. They are simply put, men who seek to hold power over others, while they are financed by men who lust after another's gold. They are infected by the oldest evils of man. Deep inside them each is a groaning mouth, of gnashing teeth torturing them with ravening hunger. A mouth that can never be satisfied with any amount of gold, power, flesh, gluttony, or substances that seek to dull. It is their fear, and lack of self esteem that demands to witness the suffering of others such that they may believe in their own godhood.

@beny874,"A great video. Liked and saved. 

However there are some semantics and comparisons that I don't agree with.

One that jumped out at me and made me notice some other things was the ""Fascism is clearly worse then Communism because America sided with the Communist"".

No, that is misleading on so many levels. America was ALLIED with Britain. In the years prior to the US joining the war you were loosing merchant ships to German U-Boats. 
You sided AGAINST Nazi Germany, not WITH Communism, you sided because you were allied with GB, not the USSR. The fact that both nations ended up fighting a common enemy doesn't strictly mean they were on the same side, and the rapid descent in relations between apperent ""allies"" in May of 45 that immediately led to the most dangerous period of world history is a clear indicator of that.

Through the looking glass of a foreigner looking in from the outside, I do agree that US political spectrum is shifted right with respect to the world's. Even here in Australia, where we are battling our own demons with Murdoch media attempting to sew far-right ideology among our less educated citizens, the US DNC is more inline with our conservative Liberal Party then our progressive Labor Party. Actually, in my opinion, perhaps it can be said that the two parties in the US is as if our ""Coalition"" government were the ruling two parties (the conservative political side here is made up of a coalition between the ""Liberal National Party"" and the ""National Party of Aus"", because each conservative party by themselves aren't large enough to form government. The Nationals are the far-right component of the Coalition.).

I understood Bidens message of a stronger GOP as a ""better, actual GOP"" since it is widely accepted among Dems and former Reps that the GOP is a shadow of its former self and isn't beholden to its founding ideals. The fact that the GOP is Lincoln's party is evidence enough of that, imagine that man seeing what the GOP is endorsing now.

So I disagree when you said Biden should be bashing the party. The country is already divided as you said, and the GOP has been doing that exact thing you said Biden should do. To do what you suggest will only further the divisions between your people. 
Make no mistake, the degradation of BOTH parties is due to modern media, especially social media. They both work together.
You have Murdoch and his Fox cronies giving air time to blatant nut jobs now because they have the hottest political takes which gets views, they then start distorting the line between hard news and opinion leading to conflating conspiracy nut jobs as actual fact. 
People then go onto their social media echochambers for a circle jerk with only embeds whatever nonsense they were fed before.

That's where your anger should be directed imo.

Also, be careful with your sentiments towards completely dismissing the opposing side of the political spectrum. Theyre both needed to complement eachother as leaving one go unchecked leads to bad things that ironically end the same way. 
I don't think you were meaning to come across that way since from the content and tone of this video you strike me as someone who knows this, but I was getting some vibes towards the end that you were advocating for the complete abolishment of conservative politics.

Anyway, like I said. Good video none the less.",0,2021-01-20T02:02:13Z,2021-01-20T02:06:41Z

@silverlightsun,"I disagree with you on many statements. 
The most important thing is, Trump and the intellectuals in the movement, fought a political, cultural and legal battle. And had zero intentions to act out political suicide. Everyone important made that very clear very fast. - cant go more into detail but its true. 
Second thing  is, the thing you describe - cooperation between megacooperations and the government plus censorship... this is what most call communism, or fascism, I call it NeoMarxism. 

And one thing at last, noone in the Trump team and the core movement likes white supremacy, insurrection racism or any kind of similar traits.
Listen to Trumps speech today, and just take it as it is. Especially the last part, is what made it so special.

I would say with the patriots they are under the illusion that they are part of the power system and morally superior to others. So when they are arrested and denied their fight they are shocked that they are treated that way. 
So this brings it down to awareness. You, as a leftist (I assume you are a leftist) are more aware of the power dynamics (than people on the right) and the mechanisms behind these power dynamics. 
I would also say IMHO that what is really hurting Trump isn't the impeachment. It is the financial fallout from banks and financial institutions world wide that are withdrawing their support.
Also physical protesting to me is all about show and I don't really see the point. It is just some visual spectacle that really doesn't achieve anything.

There's obviously a point at which censoring extremists is a better option that letting them spread their bullshit, but we've gotta be careful about exactly what we're censoring, because anything short of calls to violence is going to embolden them.",0,2021-01-19T22:06:16Z,2021-01-19T22:06:16Z

@angaeltartarrose6484,"I think that the main reason why these right-wing groups have gained so much traction is because there truly are some valid concerns which speak to them as Americans.  Perhaps the greatest irony is, their choice of leadership was so poor, that none of these issues were ever even discussed.  Further, though i am certain that there are many smart, well~spoken, & educated people among them, these were not the ones sent to the U.S. Capitol in recent days. They have done an incredible injustice to themselves if what they really want is for their concerns to be expressed, addressed, & heard.  The rest of the country now sees them as delusional, crazy, & dangerous.  Yet, their main concerns have barely been brought to the table, & are less likely than ever to be heard now.  These are a large group of barely literate, heartfelt Americans, who want their country back, ..whatever that means.  They rightly sense that there is something awry, & many middle-ground voters also recognize their valid complaints more than ever before.  They want change, & they want it now. Yet, the ways & methods of creating change must be achieved with balanced perspectives, & consideration of truth, facts, differing opinion, & new ways of finding mutual resolution.  To resort to a violent, illegal take-over attempt, backed by a simpleton's lie of voter fraud & a few catch-phrase chants, is to literally compel the nation to take a hard stand against such behavior.  People cannot say one thing & then do another, over & over, & then expect respect.  People cannot accuse other people of their very crimes.  Two wrongs do not make a right at the very least.  Find a healthy & sane way to be heard, without resorting to violence & threats, forcing a re-start, nor blaming other Americans, in order to be taken seriously.  Threatening to take down the government if y'all don't get your way is exceedingly un-American.  Grow up, & take a seat at the table with the adults, & they will listen to your valid concerns.  Bring your own evidence.  Speak your truth.  Hear the other side.  Elect officials capable of representing you fairly, & without bigotry, bullying, & violence.  I know you believe in America.

@Fantasytiger86,I feel the problem here is that we won both the civil war and world war II but we made no attempt to remove the racist ideology in fact thanks to project paper clip we invited that racist ideology and anti-semitism into our folds to build a few rockets to the Moon that we ended up doing absolutely nothing with in the long run. Germany has banned Nazism outside of historical monuments and museums they said that they will no longer tolerate that here and they stood on it if you are caught with Nazi memorabilia or pulling the shit that they did at the Capitol you would be jailed. the problem is  if we try that here it will be labeled as government overreach and stifling free speech when hate speech has never ever been included in our freedoms. We have I guess too much freedom that now any attempt at control even for the greater good is questioned or rallyed against and then we want to pull out words like you said fascism dictatorship when to be completely honest we don't have a damn clue of what that's really like but if we continue down the path we're going we are going to find out very quickly,0,2021-01-19T18:23:17Z,2021-01-19T18:24:34Z

@Neohampster,I don't accept the argument that they did a bad job so it's not a coup. If I try to bribe a government official with a million dollars they show up and try to pay him in monopoly money I didn't suddenly not try to bribe him anymore. There are many reasons why I might've shown up with play money. Maybe I just couldn't pull together the funds I desperately tried to pull together. Maybe I just thought he was stupid and would accept it. The fact is the intentions of the actions and NOT what they accomplish. They stormed the capitol with the intent of somehow forcing the government into over turning the properly elected president to install their own. Full stop. How much they accomplished is only a indication that it was poorly planned and not well led.,0,2021-01-19T16:03:24Z,2021-01-19T16:03:24Z

@drSamovar,"""Explained"" is a big claim......good analysis, though....thanks for mentioning the 30+yrs of oligarchy that went right over our apathetic heads, leading pretty much inevitably to authoritarianism.....it would have been useful to mention the beating heart of corporate control, the literal zombie parasite ""legal fiction"" corporate paper ""person"", born in 1887, and buying, stealing, and creating power and control ever since. We have ZERO chance of survival without seriously reigning in this one element. I am learning the EVERYTHING has an ""achille's heel"", and more importantly, if we ask , in full expectation of an answer, as to where this particular one is, we will be shown. Worth mentioning, too, the contribution of said corporate parasite in structuring the educational system here, 70+yrs ago, to turn out unquestioning factory workers....we are looking directly into the face of that ""great dumbing down."" It is also very important, in solid efforts to see any kind of ""explanation"" in the largest terms possible, while examining as many contributing elements as possible, to at least consider that.......all this may very well be a perfectly natural, if supremely challenging, part of our collective maturing process. Anything resembling the needed wisdom to balance out the clear ""shoe in the washing machine"" before us, is going to come in the same ""kick in the shins"" that wisdom normally enters through, given it is an experiential process, not a linear intellectual one. That lens opens up a whole range of new possibilities, one very potent support being that nearly everywhere in nature, including, and especially, the very wombs we each emerged from, that which is being born  is usually pretty sure its dying....being pushed convulsively through a narrowing dark tunnel....until.....always look for the baby.....no story or ""explanation"" is complete without it.... thank you for your good work....gracias...",0,2021-01-19T15:05:52Z,2021-01-19T15:05:52Z

Just look at what happend in gouvernment. Yes, they proceded with counting the votes, but they started to try to change the narrative immediately, claiming the rioters were Antifa. America is in a very dangerous situation, and elected officials lying to those ""special"" people will only fuel the fires. Why?

@grahamb7947,"There's so much wrong with this video, it's not even funny.

First, you give the entirely wrong definition of fascism. The real definition of fascism is neither far right nor far left. It is a centrist viewpoint which both sides of the political spectrum have utilized throughout history.

The true definition of fascism, is a movement to strongly regiment the economic and social orthodoxies of the world. AKA, making laws and regulations which harm the common people and small businesses in favor of the big corporate machines. Fascism is thus, politicians working together with big tech, mainstream media and corporations to stamp out any threat to their existence, to ensure continued holding of power for themselves.


Then you claimed Officer Sicknick was knocked unconcious and beaten to death. An entirely false claim from the start. He wasn't KO'd, and neither was he beaten to death. He died at the police precinct later in the day, while reporting for duty. He literally walked out of the capitol building and went back to work the next day, where he collapsed, was taken to hospital and died there (according to his own family, who asked for his death to not be politicized).

@hawa7264,"""We have no concept of what actual progress could look like"" - I am a German following US politics somewhat closely and from and outsiders perspective I have to say you're 100% right about that.

For context: In Germany we've been governed by a conservative party for decades (however our conservative party is comparable to the centrist democrats in the US). And it's frustrating at times - cause change is really slow if it happens at all. However there are alternatives. We have a political spectrum of parties that we can vote for: communists, centrists, capitalist libertarians, a green party and a fascist party (comparable to the trump republicans). All are represented in parliament at national level. They have competing ideas and thus have to defend their ideas against other alternatives - as it should be in a democracy. There are parties putting forward really progressive ideas (e.g. a general rent limit in bigger cities, at the moment being implemented in our capital Berlin, a tax on carbon emissions, providing an unconditional basic income to everybody) while others just want to go back to an imagined past that was better of a tiny minority.

For decades - following the liberation of Germany by Sowjets, US-Americans, French and British the US has been a kind of idol to look up to in the democratic part of Germany. This is no more the case. The US - over here - is widely seen as an example of a failing and dying democracy that can no longer provide for its people. An example that shows us to be more vigilant about certain developments (as the rise of fascism in Europe, the favouring economical freedom over personal freedom in the pandemic, ...) in our own country.",0,2021-01-19T10:30:14Z,2021-01-19T10:30:14Z

@n8ram413,"I appreciated your initial take on the capital riots and I am a conservative but you have a lot to learn, my friend. First you said that the left has been targeted more than the right on social media which is absolutely not true. The right has been getting their videos and accounts removed/banned for years and some well known figures have been placed on no fly lists among other things. Secondly and probably more importantly, you forgave communism by saying the allies allied with the communists to beat the fascists. That is correct but the US and UK figured out late in the war just how the Russians operated and started to realize that the communists were just as bad as the fascists if not worse. To put it in perspective, the nazis killed somewhere between 6-11 million non combatants including Jews. The Soviet Union was responsible for between 20-60 million deaths/executions of their own people. Do not be so foolish as to forgive communism because they were our allies; it is every bit as evil as fascism. There were multiple purges of specific racial ethnic individuals in soviet Russia. The soviets were every bit as bad or worse than the nazis. Communism has been trialed 25 times and failed every time. The only ones that seem like they are working are small countries in Europe that still maintain a partly capitalistic economy and ride on the coat tails of their stronger European allies. Why do you think brexit happened? The British got sick of paying for every hair brained European liberals social experiment from these other countries and having the EU decide how many people could migrate to the UK. The only other communist nation that could be said to be communist and remotely working is Red China. The economy works because they maintain a partially capitalistic system but the citizens have virtually no freedoms and are pushed around and forced to do what the government says. On top of that China primarily has done well economically because of inept trading policies from the US, stupid US leadership, and Chinas willingness to steal all of our patents and cheat whenever possible.

Everything past 23:00 was basically wrong. The democrats are as left as they have ever been. JFK was a capitalist and warned against socialism. His party was patriots saying, “ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country”. The modern leftist party is exactly the opposite; the dems are always looking for the next thing the government can give/do for them or what other freedom they can take away for the citizens own protection. Lol  you seem like an observant individual; I’m sure with time and more history education, you will eventually see the even more fundamental issues with your own party and the over optimistic naive view you seem to hold about healthcare, communism, etc. sometimes when things sound too good to be true, that’s because it is. Look at Canada,  their universal healthcare is broken and they flock to the USA for treatment if they can afford it.",2,2021-01-19T08:36:20Z,2021-01-19T08:59:39Z

@michaelcaprio311,"25:22 who’s the biggest evil threat too the American People both Republicans and Democrats (there are good politicians, but a lot of them STINK) (and ourselves/big government, it’s possible unfortunate that We might fall I don’t think We will, Rome, Spain, Britain too name a few though sorry Britain but still, never say never but still spooky times and dumb times but the American flag will keep flying and stay flying indefinitely I sure hope so) they care more about money and making there true boss’s (corporations) happy. What’s crippling our American Constitutional Democratic Republic is corruption (also the election of more extreme right/left wing politicians essentially taking away Republican Progressives and Democratic Conservatives, there’s no middle majority or politicians that think alike) and the 2 parties putting themselves above The American People, and what should happen instead is well The American Anti Corruption Act but Congress will NEVER pass it because they would lose power so The American Anti Corruption Act (learn more at RepresentUs’s YouTube channel) probably won’t get passed but there’s a way through local government and the signing of petition and from town too town, county too county, state too state and then nationally We The American People can end corruption once and for all, then the real work can begin being serving The American People and solving the problems that so desperately need too be solved (but not all problems big and small should be solved every time by the government, big government is NOT the way but a balance between big and small government). Corruption, I think, is the enemy of The American People and only benefits those with the most money and not with the best policy which is the unfortunate truth so making laws against corruption could help stop such corruption from happening and point being The American People are the boss of our government not corporations, money, and the rich who have the most say/representation but yeah The United States was founded on principles of a country deprived in liberty/freedom/rights and A government consisting of We The American People and representing By, For, and We The American People so let’s stick too those principles and not sail too fair away from them. Yes our country is by no means perfect, but look how fair we’ve come from 1776 too 2021 it’s bad yes but a lot if good too, we’ve got many problems that so desperately need too be resolved, but we’re supposed too be that city on a hill and well We need too keep striving too be that city on a hill too keep improving ourselves and our country and I leave off with this...

@johnleca,"You do a nice presentation and I like the facist definition. Words, terms and labels are weapons used by those not yet engaged in fire fights within this civil war. Maybe you do not feel there is an actual war going on but whatever. Yes a big issue has been who are these people and are they working as a cohesive entity and specifically at the will or direction of who? Trump the Nazi's, Daffy duck, Wiley Coyote? You do clearly state that it was a multitude of people wearing various attire that associated them to lets just say not nice groups and some who tattooed themselves with identifiers also. You interestingly state the word ""infested"" and I find that term to parallel my assertion that it was clearly groups within groups. A large crowd and what percentage of the crowd has been calculated to have actually broke any laws? I mean trespassing, vandalism, theft, assault, weapons offenses, arson? So alot of people overall who support Trump and groups that support Trump but that also have additional bagage of being Nazi's, hating blacks, somewhat radical or extreme. Some who apparently did not support Trump at all huh? I agree with you that clearly and collectively it was not an action that was focused or had a specific mission and many it seemed acted impulsively and some even just entered out of it seems curiousity. You pointed out poeple just doing dumb stuff inside and a few you felt had specific intent due to their individual outer preparations. Zip ties. You like definitions but I believe the word ""infested"" essentially means entrance by an unwanted entity and is a good word to describe exactly what occured. I am not a Trump supporter but support facts, evidence, investigation, documents, witness statements, video and audio (just like what the FBI has asked for in regard to this Capital incident). Based on what I have seen and researched it appaears quite clear that the way to diffuse the large public feelings of distrust of the election results would be to do what? An Election Commission and to have a scientific and forensic evaluation of what has been described as ""NO EVIDENCE"" by the Democrats. Ex President Obama (Democrat) many times said how important transparency in government is. Looks like he was right. Also just think about it. The Democrats should have been watering at the mouth for an Election Commission. Why? Because it was a sure bit according to them. Just think after all the ""NO EVIDENCE"" is viewed they would definitely win without question because experts (Like Jovan Hutton Pulitzer) and others would say ""hey people""  we examined the paper votes forensically and the machines and software and videos etc and ""the Big Guy"" Joe Biden did win. The Democrats are not like superheros. Standing proudly and on CNN saying we told you so. Or maybe not? Maybe they can not withstand a true examination of the ""no evidence"" and they would be found out? Which sounds reasonable and why even as of this writing is their a fight in Arizona for the actual evidence of Maricopa County?

@MineCartable,"It's a bit despicable how you put on the 'guise of being non-partisan at the start, and then work in Democrat opinions.
It's not that you're calling people Nazis, nor that you're calling out racists. It's that you're ignoring what caused the event in the first place.

Their reasoning for going there in the first place was specifically because their claims were ignored by the mainstream, and thrown out on procedural grounds by the courts. In large, their voice wasn't properly heard, and you clearly didn't listen either. It shows that you're not actually looking at this from the perspective you claimed you were.

@frankdayton731,"""And beaten to death by the patriotic mob"". 

 Does this guy even take the time to do any actual research for what he's reporting on? The capitol cop died DAYS after the riot, and the last time I checked it still isn't clear whether his death was the result of injuries sustained on the 6th.  You can't go off of what the media initially reports, in order to make assertions of fact.  They're called fake news for a reason.  The media was even including another officer's death as a ""casualty of the insurrection"", even though it was known by several reporters that he took his own life.  Once again, days after the riot.  But they reported on it as soon as they got wind of it, because it was ""breaking news"". And they wanted to fan the flames.",1,2021-01-19T03:52:09Z,2021-01-19T03:52:09Z

I idolised the USA as a kid and made it my number one destination, eventually living there for 3 years. I was stunned that students were not educated (either in school or by media) about the rest of the world. ""Biggest and Best"" was the mantra of the ""exceptional USA"" However the USA I saw growing up from old National Geographic's and tv seemed different? 
Don't take my word for it, take your own. Look at any cinema or tv from the 1920's to 1950's, from the Marx Bros to To Tell the Truth. Bright, articulate and most of all ""Worldly."" In the later, B Grade actors (hardly the stuff of Harvard intellectuals) could question guests about their stories relying on THEIR KNOWLEDGE about famous artists, current world events, streets of famous cities etc"" Eventually they would find the real ""famous"" person from 2 imposters. Could the rioters do this. Could they pick out another country on a map even?
Living in a BUBBLE of everything American is best, leads to 24 hour local news stations, or mainstream media that REPEAT THE SAME STORY (American) for 24 hours, 48, a week? Filled with other Americans giving their opinions in minute detail. Meanwhile the rest of the world has told thousands of stories and are listening to what is going and their place in the world.
Empires end with this kind of self obsession...sloganeering...lack of Education.

You’re not even wrong that the consequences of further anti-terror legislation is bad. We agree there. But the left still does, or at least should, want the state to fight right-wing extremism, and so we need to frame the critique of the state as a critique, not a complete negation. 

It sounds a lot like you’re saying that *all* policy meant to fight violent extremism is bad. The types of “war on terror” policies you’re referring to here ARE bad, but you’re doing a really poor job citing them correctly.

A completely innocent Muslim man being pulled off a flight is a LOT different than a violent idiot who participated in an insurrection being pulled off a flight.

@levity90,"If you truly believe 74 million people in this country are uneducated white supremacist racist bigots and you don't understand their reasons for voting for Trump, you're a moron. Plain and simple. 

There were THOUSANDS of people of ALL backgrounds on Capitol Hill that day. if there happened to be a higher percentage of white people, for anyone who doesn't know, white people are actually the majority in this country. So there's a little bit of shocking news for you. And out of those THOUSANDS of people a small fraction of them decided to be assholes. 
Every conservative media outlet has condemned what happened. But the mainstream media and channels like this will be intent on pushing the narrative that Trump supporters are all uneducated racist bigots etc. Really shows the elitist attitudes of so many coastal Democrats from big cities like NY, etc. I love when liberals in my city claim to care about minorities while they come here from other states and they gentrify minority neighborhoods making it next to impossible for the minorities who live there to afford living there. Keep it up all you people in prospect heights. I hope you're enjoying your Starbucks and your citibikes.  

It's really quite simple why people voted for Trump. Because the liberal left have lost their goddamn minds. 

When I, an American of Puerto Rican descent, am forced to compete for cleaning jobs with dozens of immigrants who are willing to work for pennies there's a problem. When we can't ensure that our own citizens are able to find decent paying jobs because of competition from outsiders that's a problem. Idc what industry you are in. If ten americans have the qualifications to do a job and an immigrant worker is picked over them, that's a fucking problem. I don't care if it's cleaning hotel rooms or working as an analyst.

Socialism is being touted as the solution to societies inequities by young college aged morons who don't know what the fuck they're talking about. I'm 29 and I look around me at these kids and young adults and am fucking beside myself and baffled by the failure of our educational institutions. 

Yes let's continue to push for Socialism  which left over 100 million people dead in the 20th century. Let's forget about people ever being able to accumulate generational wealth and something that they can pass on to their children. Let's forget about the work ethic of individuals in society and how that differs across people and communities. Let's forget about private property. Let's tax the wealthy at a higher percentage because you know, them having more money is unfair and all. Let's disregard the fact that the vast majority of millionaires in this country became millionaires because of their life choices and work ethic. Let's act like we're owed their money simply because some people have less. Let's get reparations for a subset of minorites who were never slaves and take from people who were never slave owners. Ironically the descendants of many slave owners are probably poor and live in the rural South. I suppose the fair thing to do would be to take those people (who were never slave owners) and have them work for black Americans now. I guess that makes sense. That will solve the problems of black and hispanic inner cities and the cultural norms which lend themselves to people not finishing school, having children young, committing crime etc. If only my sister and mother had some extra money in their pockets when they were 16 years old neither one of them would have became pregnant and dropped out of school. Let's pretend culture has nothing to do with the way that people live their lives and until cultural norms change communities won't change. Let's pretend that minorities have no agency in their lives and are victims forever and always. Because this mentality will be very beneficial to them. They'll continue to look to the state and federal government for help and will be dependent on government checks the rest of their lives. 

Let's call for universal health care and make college free for all. Let's ignore how much taxes will be raised in order to accomplish this. Nobody really wants to think about how they're not going to see nearly half their paycheck in order that services like this get enough funding. Let's ignore how over 700,000 Americans die every year from preventable heart disease brought on by our own way of life and justify enormously high taxes to pay for problems like this. When people make comparisons between the average life expectancy in Canada vs United States and make the argument that it's because of their healthcare system while ignoring the fact that we're a fat country with severe dietary and lifestyle issues, let's ignore that that's blatant propaganda and ignorance. Let's ignore that we are a morbidly obese country that has a long way to go to change these cultural norms which leads so many of us to be so unhealthy. 

Let's pay for college for all and ignore how many people have a hard time finding jobs already because the market is saturated with people who are ""college educated"" and we continue to import immigrants from all over the world who are also competing for these same jobs. 

let's pretend how we want to model ourselves off of the Scandinavian countries when in reality we're moving more towards what it's like in Venezuela.  Coporate tax in Scandinavia is generally pretty low, the burden of tax is spread evenly across the middle class, there is no federal minimum wage, and they tried a universal basic income and it failed. 
Every year more and more people in Norway buy Private health insurance to supplement their State insurance because of dissatisfaction with the state insurance. All of Scandinavia are also much leaner and fitter people and take their health more seriously than the average American. So the amount of money that they're spending on people every year in regards to healthcare is incomparable to us. But let's ignore this and you know pretend like we want to model ourselves after them even though we're calling for higher corporate taxes, a federal minimum wage which will lead to employers hiring less people or firing more people, and unfairly tax the rich because we feel like we're entitled to their money. 

I want to write more but honestly I'm tired.

a) cowardly, cynical Republicans or...
b) nut-job conspiracy-theory believing Republicans who shouldn’t be let anywhere near any functioning government.

One of the biggest problems is we are now facing the ultimate manifestations of the Reaganite politicians, or, to put it another way, anti-politics politicians.

These idiots are the ones who run for office under a general slogan/ideology of “the government can’t do anything so please hear me to make the government worse”.  Now this isn’t a completely American thing but it’s a GIGANTIC problem for conservative ideology, because it’s poison.

Politics by the end of the 20th century had made massive strides to change and improve and augment the lives of millions of people across the globe, and in this century now the aim should have been to try and create, not just a minimum wage, or even living wage, but a minimum standard of life.

And I believe that.

Politics can have a huge impact on that by using that power for the good of the people.

But the Republican Party at the minute is rotting like a fish at its head, however, in spite of all this shit on January 6th, there were the tiniest offshoots of direct democracy having an impact with various states gaining support for increased minimum wage, wealth taxes and even maternity pay.

@krejados1,"There is a more recent example of the new 'terrorist' legislation than McCarthyism. 
The Patriot Act was pushed through in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when the country was still reeling from the shock. Stopping terrorism was its purported aim.
In 2010, a trifling 9 years after the government gave itself legal permission to invade citizens' privacy, the Obama administration rolled out the 'If you see something, say something' campaign nationwide.  (It was initially a New York awareness program that started in 2003). Ostensibly, ordinary citizens would do their patriotic duty and report suspicious terrorist activity to (wait for it) their local police - NOT the department of homeland security. 
So badly did the powers that be want people to do that that, in 2014, DHS proclaimed September 25th the See Something, Say Something Awareness Day.
In effect, this program encourages people to rat out others. Apparently, it's working. In the aftermath of Jan 6, people are turning in their neighbors, relatives and, to the extent that they have them, their coworkers. 
Methinks that's the scaffolding that the incoming administration's campaign is building their fight against terror on.

@akosalu9328,"I believe the viewpoint you make at this video, tho i have some thoughts on that. I live in europe, a country were communist parteis ruled few times, first germans at a time of hitler and second time by russia. The influence was mental, i was born at a time when our country just got free, i was in very poor family. When i went to school, tere was some students that had some anger and mental issues. It became a nightmare to me, i was beaten down and bullied for years, and going home was fear of getting lockt because i couldnt do my schoolworks, all because the inner pain. After first grade, i lost all my friends, and i had no father figure to support me. I was my own, the rage, the violence, the viscious people that i saw and the corruption by the schoolhead when telling to my parents no, i couldnt study because i was mentally ill. after a visit to mental doctors, 2nd grade, they told to take me out of the school, schoolhead told no everything will get better. I was about 8 and didnt understand what was going on. About 7 years i was at the school and it had never got better, only worse. At that time, i kept it all inside of me, because i didnt whant anyone to get hurt because of my pain, i took it all, i started to think that the pain was allday normal especially because i had no friends or any other view of the world. All i was was pain, but it all taught me something, something greatly valuable. People can do all sorts of unbeleaveble things and meny who seek the power through manipulatsion of fear. Even tens of years after country getting free, i had still witnessed how fear can be turned, used against you and and make you run twords it. How fear can manipulate your thoughts and supresse your freedome, other times used to make you believe things that keeps you supressed or choose paths that they want. For me, gategorizing people into different sections like for example ""normal person telling other that hes abnormal"" is sign of mental manipulatsion of power. Same goes with fashism, leftists and so on. Their designed to separate. The thing that bothers me the most is the part you cut out from beginning were trump mentions clearly ""piecefuly"". I also have seen video about chatter were ""one very beard men"" who was seen at this video, talked about how to keep trump out getting reelected. The way you show and only talk about the things that people ""want to hear"" makes me question a lot of things. It seems to me like most of you have been bough off thoughts of fear to create a social freedome were ones view is only the right view even when the other may be right, and it all withought through investigation by cia or fbi.

@MrGiggitygoo31,"First time here. Thought it was going to be a legit analysis, but there were multiple hyperbole moments that swung one way with a bunch of feelings. I went back to look at your healthcare video and it explained your political stance rather than sound objectivity, so I started to get an idea of the implicit bias.  ""A man that gave them next to nothing"" is a quote from someone who hasn't looked into why people actually like him (hint: part of it has something to do with why big pharma and wall street hate him and why they backed Biden). Finally, just because a member of the nazi's likes Trump doesn't damn everybody for voting for Trump. Just like white supremacist Richard Spencer supports BIden, one should not assume all white supremacist support him. I truly mean no disrespect, but this whole video (and the healthcare one) is showing one point then backing it up with hyperbolic feelings. Again, just like your healthcare video, this is well made! It just lacks credibility and critical thinking.

@justinalias7969,"14:18 “This is what the Republican Party has become... disgruntled workers, Q anon cultists, business owners, Nazis etc.” 

I beg to disagree. One of the main reasons Joe Biden won this election was because Republican middle income (workers and small business owners) white males voted for him more than Trump. Biden won less of nearly every minority block compared to Clinton. Trump cultists (and his elected followers) are the ones who perpetrated this seditious event. Many republicans dislike trump or were Never Trumpers. Even Republicans who voted for Trump found his actions disgraceful during this riot. 

Imho, we are probably going to see a portion of the Republican Party break off and become a third party centered around Trump. Probably gonna Ross Perot the next election too. If Democrats pass election reform dissolving the electoral college in favor of a popular vote, I guarantee this will happen. 

Otherwise, pretty good video that regular explains the content of the RIOT not the Republican Party in general.",0,2021-01-18T18:58:46Z,2021-01-18T18:58:46Z

I'm hoping people are going to critically evaluate the laws that come out of this, but at the same time, use of federal power in this case is entirely justified. They were part of a violent coup that could have genuinely overthrown our government if it was a little more put together and planned.

We should want these people to be held responsible for their part. Especially because this will help establish for the right that they don't have more privileges to the point where they will never be inconvenienced for participating in riots and violence. If they piss off the federal government, they will be held to account. I think that the gleeful turning in of others plays into this. The people being turned in are the sort where love has been lost on a massive scale between them and their friends and co-workers. While I agree that this may contribute to the normalization of turning people in, I do think that it happening in this case is also something of an outlier. If someone was saying awful things in your ear for however long, or shilling something horrible, and then openly participated in a violent crime that attempted to overthrow the capital, a lot of people are going to be petty and take the opportunity to get that person out of their life.

I think this scenario in general is going to be an outlier and I hope it doesn't come up again. But I guess we'll see.",0,2021-01-18T18:24:34Z,2021-01-18T18:24:34Z

@mrogers0130,"I will say your point that the US sided with the communists in ww2 implies the communists were better than the fascists as a little bit of a stretch. Both were absolutely horrid regimes that led immeasurable suffering. The fact is though, that the British and French had both already fought very tough wars against Germany in the Franco-Prussian war and ww1 so they would naturally feel threatened by an aggressive expansionist Germany. Whereas the Soviet Union would be seen as a less immediate threat and thus makes them more tolerable to ally with in another war with Germany. I don't think they really saw Stalin as a more humane leader, just the Germans were a more immediate threat. That's just my thoughts",0,2021-01-18T17:40:12Z,2021-01-18T17:40:12Z

And yet we are the bad guys, while trying to overthrow your democratically elected president makes you the good guy.

@atobpe,"To say this video is biased is a gross understatement.  Within about the first five minutes, there are three elements that demonstrate the bias.  First, at 4:33 is a segment showing one very angry out of control Trump supporter who is NOT representative of the vast majority of his supporters.  The segment is disingenuous to say the least.  The overwhelming majority of Trump supporters would not support the idea of occupying the Capital.  Secondly, at 4:44, the narrator states that ""thousand's of Trump fanatics...""  Thousands of Trump fanatics???  The narrator betrays his bias when using such inflammatory language.  He easily could have said ""Trump supporters"", but he just had to slip in that word, ""fanatics.""    Then at 4:59, the narrator is talking about the belief of Trump supporters that Joe Biden stole the election.  At 5:02, he states that ""... this belief has absolutely no basis in reality.""  It is at that point that the narrator lost all credibility.  The Presidential legal team (Rudy Giuliana, Jenna Ellis, etc.) put forth legal evidence in the various hearings at various state legislature hearings including Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  Those presentations included not only sworn affidavits of voter fraud (sworn under penalty of perjury), eye witness testimonies, and expert witness testimonies.  In a court of law, those are all considered valid legal evidences that should be a basis to hear a case.  I know that virtually all of the mainstream media are reporting that there is no basis for this claim, but the evidence presented in the legislative hearings says otherwise.  I am reminded of the Wizard of Oz who, when the curtain was disturbed to reveal his presence, said ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.""  I do not have the time or space to continue, but suffice it to say that this video is biased - very biased; subtly but assuredly.",1,2021-01-18T16:28:45Z,2021-01-18T16:29:20Z

If NONE armed forces join in, the activity usually does not rise to the level of a coup... it just stays as a protest.

Why is it so hard for us to understand that there may be a difference in the color of our skin but we are ACTUALLY ALL only part of ONE race, the HUMAN race, the ONLY race there is, how the hell can people judge other people just based on the color of their skin? Why the hell do people still think those trash primitive thoughts will get us anywhere besides hate and violence? There is no progress in that, we are just repeating the same shit that has been going on endlessly throughout history. I am a 27 year old dark blonde haired blue eyed white American and i never would go around waving a filthy confederate flag or wearing some form of white supremacy t-shirt yelling “heil hitler” or some shit. Fuck those people man like why cant we move FORWARD with peaceful progress and continue with change in equality for all? Change our ways, spread the peace, get rid of the hate and think to the future of us, our children, and our grand children. Then it comes to the corrupt politicians. The rich are getting richer and the sick are getting sicker (Grandson quote) but seriously, politicians on both sides are completely corrupt and only care about controlling and locking down the people for their own greedy benefit. Which in turn makes corporations very powerful. Our country has been slowly turning into that. The rich corporations are getting more powerful and the small fry people and small businesses are out of work. Its getting scary, it really is, we need an honest person for once in politics, and a good one that doesnt get bought by corporations. But anyways, theres so much other shit to worry about than attacking each other, being greedy and hurting people. Our whole species could be wiped out at any moment by some asteroid, super volcano, solar flare, gamma ray burst, deadly virus that could kill us off (hopefully covid doesn’t have enough DNA points for that). One person comes to mind when I see hope for our future in expansions of our species. Elon Musk. He is the person who I admire, who works hard to try to get us to his goal of advancing the Human race, accomplishing the huge feat of reusable rockets and making so much progress to eventually landing Humans on Mars and establishing a base there.... assuming we don’t kill ourselves first... there needs to be changes, big changes, the big corporations need to have less power and the people need more. There needs to be less racism and more agreement for the benefit of the human race, but, thats probably never going to happen...",0,2021-01-18T14:24:38Z,2021-01-18T14:24:38Z

@oysteijo,"This video explains very good what is happening. JT is right in (nearly) all his comments, and it matches the view of many Europeans whos now shaking their heads in disbelieve over the ridicules situation in the US. But remember this: Trump as a president is not the problem. When a person like Trump become the president that is rather the symptom that something is really wrong. The problem in the US is not that there is only two political parties.  Because in reality it is only one. Both Democrates and Republicans are far off to the right end of the political scale that they are basically just one. And we all know how the nations with a one-party political system are. As JT explains here is that we should actually hope that Trump is not convicted in the impeachment, such Trump does not become the sacrificial goat, and let everyone off the hook. This will just lead to another incompetent president in the future that is lying just as much Trump has done, and caring just as little for the people as Trump has done.",0,2021-01-18T12:52:00Z,2021-01-18T13:19:22Z
@thebush6077,"This feels a little biased. Both the right and the left have been equally stupid and violent, just the left has been slightly less stupid but not by much. The BLM message is right but BLM riots were not peaceful (you don't board up your shop when a ""peaceful protest"" is in town.... and then have your car set on fire.) The capital riot was more shameful, maybe a bit sad. Both of these things highlight the massive problems and divisions in the country and issues with the government. It's also inaccurate and harmful to say every republican is a racist. Statements like that will only further radicalize them. People on both sides are being consistently lied to, mislead, and intentionally poked by the opposite side which is not helping.

@ChristianCentury2000,"If you are correct in your analysis of Donald Trump, then these people are as STUPID and crazy and futile and foolish as when Barabas (in the time of Jesus) tried to overthrow the Roman army! And, Donald Trump will have to make an account of why so many neo-Nazis and fascists came to DC as one of his supporters, and assaulted the Capitol building as domestic terrorists! I don't want to view Donald Trump as a bad guy traitor or racist or American Hitler, as I don't think that he is any of that. If your analysis is accurate, then I am an idiot conspiracy freak sucker. And, Donald Trump is an evil liar and needs to be arrested and charged with sedition, insurrection and treason. 

I believe that Sydney Powell and Donald Trump... truly honestly genuinely believe that there was massive unprecedented voter fraud and that they won the 2020 elections but were denied the fruits of their hard labors in last fall's arduous political campaign!

You are incorrect in damning the Republican party. The Republican party of now was not the GOP of yesterday. Go ask John Eisenhower and Susan Eisenhower. Likewise the Democratic party of now is not the same party of Woodrow Wilson or Andrew Johnson! As social culture changes over time, political parties also change over time.

""Second Thought,"" conservatism is also not synonymous with racism and hate, as liberalism is not the same as communism.

Fall of the Soviet Union and the ousting of puppet governments in the 'captive' states. 
Even the Arab Spring.

Some are 'people power' or 'singing revolutions' others become a descent into hell like Libya and Syria.

@DaFrancc,"I can’t with this video. I agree that there were many nazis, white supremacists, entitled rich folk, government officials and cops as I have now learned, and many more, this doesn’t represent the whole party. It is unfortunate that those people identify as Republicans, but I believe that the only belief they and other Republicans and conservatives share is love for their country. There was a video of several protesters outside the capitol who were booing those who broke in, surprised I didn’t see that in the video. Trump has denounced the rioters, and so have many other mainstream conservatives. The ones who believe this stolen election crap are the ones that the conservatives with at least half a brain try to distance from because they are not capable of thinking critically. 

Now this doesn’t mean that many conservatives have doubts about the election process, just a few months before the election, everyone I knew on both sides had doubts. After the many lawsuits that were filed, many conservatives accepted the fact that sure, Biden won, the ones who didn’t accept it were the ones that spoke loudest. I would like to briefly point out is that there is quite a bit of precedent for recounts to happen. One of those times it actually changed the results in favor of the election of Rutherford Hayes which found that both sides cheated a lot. I forget the exact history but I believe there was a compromise that Hayes would be president and he would remove fed troops from the south. Take that with a grain of salt, please. Going back to what I was saying, conservatives believe that their voice is not heard very well by the mainstream media or by the left in general, they feel that their voice is often represented by the worst of people who call themselves Republicans. As a human I am ashamed to say that I share the same species as them. 

I have read some articles and opinions that say that Trump is not the cause of the divide between the lines, but the symptom of it, I think there is some truth to that. Republicans gave him that platform to challenge the mainstream bias against Republicans, I was too young to understand the political climate in 2015 and was at first against Trump and Hillary (mostly against Trump), but I have come to support him because of his policies and because of the bias I see all over the internet. I think he had the right to challenge the election at first, but it is evident that he did not win and now hopefully many Republicans will try to respect Biden. 

This video (so far I have only watched half), I don’t think has done enough to separate the good side of the Republicans, and the things we call humans. Another thing I can clearly see is that this video is also biased saying that fascists are worse than communists 21:25 just because we sided with the USSR in WWII. We sided with the USSR because Germany was fighting a war on all fronts, the US had allies in Europe which were being attacked by Nazis, not communists. Just because we fought with the communists does not mean that fascists were worse, it was because they were against everyone.

To expand on what I said earlier that most conservatives do not support these mindless fools, I say the same thing about liberals back during the BLM protests; I believe they do not support the mindless fools who burnt down businesses and took over police stations. I believe both sides understand the struggles of the protesters and (to an extent) the others, conservatives believe their voice is not heard, liberals believe that non-whites are treated unfairly and that cops are racist. I believe that cops need some change, but to paint all cops as racist is like saying that all conservatives are revolutionary fascist racists; a few bad eggs do not spoil the whole carton, you need to open all of them to see which are good and bad.

Going back to the divide in our country, we now have the banning of conservatives on social media, and the removal of Parler. Whether or not they supported the riots in any way is your opinion which I will not be discussing. What I will be discussing are the effects of removing them: it makes them martyrs. If the companies and officials let them drown, Parler and the officials would’ve lost their support naturally, but by removing them outright, they have given conservatives a martyr therefore increasing the support the officials and Parler may or may not deserve.

Before I finish, I forgot to talk about his first response video. I think he could’ve been more clear on his position, it doesn’t do enough to distinguish between the “humans” and the protesters with brains, and he keeps talking about election fraud which I think is a bad move at this point. My take on the video is that he was talking to the protesters and not the rioters as he never explicitly referred to the rioters (you could argue that he never mentioned the protesters either), my thinking is supported by the fact that he has taken a clear and harsh stance condemning the racist rioters as he has condemned racism throughout his whole campaign.

Lastly, I would like to reiterate that I do not stand with Trump when it comes to COVID itself being fake (I think that he did a decent job mitigating it. I also hear about this second wave stuff, I think it’s just spreading through the country, New England got hit first, then it was the south, now the first ones to get hit seem to be flattening the curve) and his stance on election fraud now as compared to at first as explained at the end of the 3rd paragraph. Please like so this gets seen and leave a comment so we can talk about this. I want to have an intelligent discussion so if whatever you have to say follows something like “You’re a racist fascist homophobic Trump-supporter!”, hopefully you are at least smarter than the fascinating beings I keep talking about to understand that I won’t respond. Though I will reply if there are enough moronic and un-constructive replies.

Update 1: I was misled to believe that the video would try to understand Republicans when he talks about who is to blame for inciting the riots. While Trump is partly to blame for adding fuel to the fire, I think that Republicans and Democrats (including the people, the parties, and the corporations) as a whole did much to start this. While it is easy point fingers at Republicans and more easily at Trump, it is foolish to think that Democrats had no role in this. I’d like to point back to how the mainstream media and Democrats often demonize Republicans in just about everything. Now, the right does this too, but they don’t have as much control over the media now do they? I would also argue that the right is more understanding of both sides as I see many high profile conservatives (the ones who don’t argue nonsense) believe that the media, politicians, and those you see in protests and on tv are just the surface of both sides, there are many people underneath on both sides who are worth talking to, I know from experience. That could be biased as I personally am not very aware of leftist personalities that are not the media. Feel free to point me to some critically thinking leftists personalities. To those of you who will point at that poll, I wonder what the sample size was and where they got it from, because if that is true, then I need to find new friends because clearly half of the conservatives aren’t worth talking to (not).",0,2021-01-18T08:56:32Z,2021-01-18T09:15:37Z

@radioactivedetective6876,"23:36 - Thank you. As someone looking from outside the outrage about the ""coup"", and the very fact that it is being called a ""coup"", seemed ironic, considering so many US Presidents, and the FBI, have backed, funded and engineered so many actual coups - coups with organised military involvement, tanks rolling down the streets - before Trump with impunity and a whitewashed legacy. I laughed so hard reading George Bush that he was ""appalled"" and the MAGA mob were “inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes” - that's rich!

@offroadr,"I am not sure I agree with all your points, but this was very well thought out and brings up many points, weather I agree with them or not, that are worth thinking long and hard about.  

I imagine the DHS came to your house because you were reported to them by someone.  This is what I would expect them to do.  The crux of the matter is what happened how did they treat you and are you facing ongoing concerns because of it.  Also as much as I trust you base on my 0 experience of you, there is always the possibility that you are not who you claim and also have another agenda.   I don't think this, but just saying DHS came to your house does nothing really to explain anything or put DHS in a positive or negative light.   I had the police come to my house... What does that actually mean?  In my case I was trying to call a zoom meeting and the meeting room started with 911 and I accidentally hung up just before I started dialing that part.

@radioactivedetective6876,"There is so much talk about how the capitol hill riots have exposed that the MAGA mob never really cared about cops, they are white supremacists who just went with ""blue lives matter"" as a counter slogan to BLM; sadly that seems to have shifted attention from how white supremacist  the policing institution itself is. One policeman died, several were injured by the MAGA and QAnon, and we have police departments promptly identifying and taking action against policemen who were present in the crowd - the ""some bad apples"" narrative seems to be back, videos of injured and traumatised policemen talking about their experience helps to reinvent the human face of the police, yet not many people seem to be asking why the police depts are so prompt and unequivocal and assertive in their attitude towards officers complicit with the Capitol Hill riots but are so slow in case of other atrocities perpetrated by them. Is it because congress persons' lives matter more than ordinary citizens' lives? Sure, ask the Capitol police about their experience on 6th jan, what they think of Trumpist goons, but also ask them what they think of their colleagues in Portland, or Cleveland or NYPD, or Kyle Rittenhouse.

@radioactivedetective6876,"The corporatist ""normie"" neo-lib establishment are the main gainers in the entire capitol hill incident - and that includes both the democratic party and republican party establishment. After all, people like Biden, Schumer, Pelosi have much in common with Mitch McConnel, Mitt Romney, etc- the mainstay of their power and priviledge is the status quo. Trump went rogue and the establishment closed ranks. This entire season of election turned out to be such a win-win for the establishment - they successfully sidelined the Bernie Sanders faction, Biden winning helped in solidifying the claim that ""centrist"" candidates are the way to go, if they Trump convict Trump (which probably they will) then there won't be any chance of him hijacking the GOP base and they can have other racist Republicans who understand the benefits of working within the system run in 2024.

It's pretty clear what their intentions were, they just sucked at the execution.  Also, if that police officer hadn't distracted them minutes before the politicians were evacuated, they might have been able to take hostages or murder people. 

As for the tech censorship, they planned an insurrection online?  Obviously, they need to be punished to set the precedent that you can't just do a coup and get away with it.

@iliakatster,"While I agree you that the introduction of anti-terrorism laws is scary, I wouldn't characterize people turning in capitol rioters as an expansion of state powers or a new bad precedent. They're reporting actual violent crime, not thought policing. If I saw my friend or neighbor was building a bomb, I'm gonna report that. If they had been talking about hanging a public official, then went to a rally where they had a chance of that happening, I'm gonna report it. If they just like going to Trump rallies and screaming at people, I'm gonna tell them they're assholes, but I'm not going to report it to the feds. The people scrubbing the capitol footage want to stop people from violently invading the capitol and killing people with pipebombs and weapons, they're not going after people chanting or breaking curfew laws. And the use of no-fly lists for these people is justified. They went to a rally that could have turned into a massive hostage situation, involved multiple reports of improvised explosives, and an idiological motive to use them, someone willing to use hostages and explosives to advance an idiological goal is not the kind of person you want on a plane. As investigations go on, I'm sure people not involved in the most dangerous crimes will get cleared off the list. Its not a punishment, its a precaution.",0,2021-01-17T23:43:32Z,2021-01-17T23:43:32Z

@queeng508,"i think you might be believing that the republican party you have in the us is the way a republican party is meant to be. i say this also connecting it with your comments on laws against domestic terrorism and therefore with surveillance and so on. you said and/or implied that  this kind of laws will be something that will only damage/endanger us' people and classify movements like the blm one as terrorism and/or different political views as such, however i think you might be forgetting or not considering the fact that fascism (the real one, not the one americans use to speak about authoritarianism) and other ideologies that are structured in a way that is meant for some to lay on others' shoulders (as in a form of slavery, or of biological superiority and/or in many other forms) or for some to decide that their own freedom is more important/valid than someone else's is not a valid ideology, in fact is a form of extremism (again, not in the way americans use it, but in the literal meaning) and as such it is, if amplified, the cause of terrorist acts, as of actions that make others' freedom be taken away.
i want to add that making comparison between blm and (neo-)fascism is the first mistake you tand to make, because putting them on the same level is ignoring the fundamental differences between the two (but also other comparison too): the black lives matter movement is made of peaceful protests based on justice calling for equality, while fascism is a violent ideology based on someone's supremacy and superiority over others, which practically trasforms in someone's right to exist and freedom being more important (or the only one important) the others'.
you/anyine could argue that there are violent acts committed by blm's protesters but you would be missing the fact that one's actions is not the ideology's equivalent in this case, while it is in the case of fascism.
also i would like to speak about your comments on the 'status quo' of us' government system: yes, it is broken, but at the same time if in fact biden were to call out trump/republicans individually he would be putting himself, therefore the figure of the presidency, at the same level of someone who is not the president and whose actions are criminal. this would results in people picking sides against him specifically instead of picking side based on facts/beliefs. the job of calling out names should be done by those who enbody justice and by their colleagues or same-level-people, so that you as a nation can preserve the value of the presidency. you, again, could argue: why should we preserve it? well, you yourself spoke about this in your video, so i started from that for my argument.
one more thing regarding your comment on how basically corrupt by interests your politics is at the moment (the one you named 'status quo') and honestly i agree, as in many other things you said, but i think that for this to be over you simply (relatively) have to speak about it in a non political (as in not using examples and commenting the ideology behind it, but using examples to show how X is payed by Y and does politicies that favors Y, on all sides) enviroment and start from there untill you have people's fundings instead of lobbies and such.
just like i agree on this, i agree with you on the fact that yes, your left wing is now what a right wing party is supposed to look like, while the right is extremism, and i believe that the solution to that is to clearify where a valid point of view ends while an extreme point of view starts, and to do this i would send you back to where i spoke about terrorism and ideologies, because that is the base and the foundation.
however, i would point out that when you spoke about biden telling that he wants to fund police, i believe it might not be necessarily a bad thing itself, because those money could be use to fund specialized units, better training (for example, psychological, like many other if not most of the countries do) and so on, instead of guns and such. i say this not knowing what he meant nor in what context he said it; i just wanted to put this thought out there, because it is the same principle as the 'defund the police' has.
however, good video. i appreciate the effort to examine the contexts and its roots and consequences.",0,2021-01-17T23:08:25Z,2021-01-17T23:09:00Z

Hint: If Trump had somehow delivered Pence and Pelosi to that crowd and told them to tear them to shreds, there would have been nothing left but bones and teeth. 

No, Trump doesn't get off. Treason demands retribution. 

I know you made this before some of the more recent events, so I'm wondering... now that Trump HAS been impeached and even McConnell is hinting he might vote to convict, do you now agree that impeachment was the right course?

I tried explaining that the meaning of those flags are mutually exclusive. “Government leave me alone” versus “I support the enforcers of government”. He got annoyed when I pointed this out, but thats as far as I got. 

Whats sad is that Trump, the media, and the politicians who encouraged and made excuses for this, will not be going to federal prison like so many of the rioters. These people were used. Anyone involved deserves their sentence, but the influencers and instigators, will face no penalties.

Allying with Stalin is one of the VERY few times in history the ends justified the means, Hitler was a massive destabilizing factor and an imminent threat to just about everyone. Stalin wasn't a threat yet, they didn't like him, but he wasn't going around actively changing the map red.

I guarantee if Stalin moved first and started conquering european nations the allies would have been comprised of America britain and Germany.

Ultimately America and Britain didn't like EITHER of them.

@shawndrazner5924,Most conservatives and republicans denounce the violence and agree that what happened was horrible. Another thing you fail to mention is the fact that what happened at the capital was happening as trump was giving his speech not after. So to say that the presidents intentions were to incite this is extremely misleading. Another point I would like to make is that the president had no incentive to incite as it directly hurts him. The moment that this happened congress was discussing creating a comity to re judge the election and this would have put the matter to rest in a peaceful way. And to make a big deal about this but not to condemn the 200 days of BLM rioting and so many people getting hurt and killed is just ironic. Fringe left activists created a whole freaking country within America and called it chaz. Or did we all forget about that. Now I fully condemn the actions that happened on capital hill and I think that people who entered should be prosecuted but the spin on this story is just so misleading.,0,2021-01-17T20:00:17Z,2021-01-17T20:00:17Z

@cereal9285,"This is a good video but you're completely delusional with the statement that the capitol hill protest was more violent than all of the BLM/ recent george floyd riots.

There is also CHAZ/CHOP/autonomous zones which are insurrectionist movements in of themselves. It really isn't a surprise that trump supporters stormed the capital given that multiple cities around the country have been on fire for several months on end, and then to tack on coronavirus restrictions on top of that is just a recipe for disaster.

Both times, they took me into custody for several hours before determining I wasn’t enough of a “threat” at the moment. I’ve also had my Twitter account deleted and have had several 30-day bans from Facebook, mainly for criticising institutions such as the FBI and the CIA, and for being a socialist.

@danielwarren7110,"AS a Conservative from another county, the two party system has never shown its weakness greater than now, having a party system that encourages multiple parties and with that cross party co-operations, seems to be needed, in a country of over 320,000,000 people having only two parties groups everyone into US v Them, both parties do that, with a wider range of parties, then parties could speak for the diversity of the the population. The UNITED states has always been that a coalition of States, the peoples in the North East are so different from those in Texas, Florida from the North West, The Bible belt from the South West, and so on. breaking all of these people down into an A or a B is silly, it means the parties only have to speak to a small section, it is why money from companies or organs such as the NRA have a larger voice than the average man, or even small city. 

Prior to the riots in the Democracy Index the USA was ranked 25th out of 166 countries. It is curious to see if the riots have an impact on the next set of rankings to be released. The US has always by Europe and others been watched with a bit of one eyebrow raised, it is great to have pride and some of we live here so ""we are the best"" chanting, but looking at any of the international indexes GDP per capital, education, healthcare, freedom, happiness index, etc. The US does not, as many of the ""man in the street"" believe, rank number one. This is due to years of nationalism, or liberalism being fed by a media that is funded by companies or individuals that due to a lack of neutral oversight want to feed their own agenda to as many people as possible. Freedom of Speech is great if it has responsibility with it, you can impose some restrictions on it and actually have a freer conversation. Take the UK for example the national BBC is owned by the government officially, but regulated by what in the USA would be the Senate, with the party in charge potentially changing hands every 4 years, regulations have come into place to ensure its neutrality in all things political and news, large parties must be given equal air time, news reporting must be factual and non politically edited. 

Many other countries have similar things, for example, if a program (or channel) uses the word ""news"" in its name then all stories and must be neutrally and factually reported. (exceptions for obvious parodies, see ""Not the Nine O'Clock News"") changes in the legal system where currently it can take someone hundreds of thousands of dollars to even get to a court case when suing for defamation, libel, slander, etc. A system needs to be in place that enables those who political opinion shows decide to target a way to not only get redress but also that forces the the media show/platform to retract in such a way as an equal number of their audience see it as saw the first offence. Currently in the US you can use an opinion piece on prime time on a prime show with a prime presenter to promote conspiracy theories, but if a C&D letter arrives that requires you retract that, the channel can get away with retracting it at 2am and airing it when a completely different audience is watching, a smaller, sleepier, audience. Media should be allowed to air opinions of the owners, but many in the USA (from the views of those in Europe) seem to take these shows as fact and as their sources of news, this can be regulated without interfering with freedom of speech. 

Many other countries have more robust rules on Hate speech and such, it is seen by many people that the US jumps ""freedom of speech"" and what is presented to other countries and what is heard by other countries is ""freedom to be dumb, uneducated and rude"". 
Freedom to speak your mind in a cohesive way.     Brilliant. 
Freedom to have a free and fair debate.                   Bring it on more power to you.
Freedom to voice concerns and dissent against the government. Amazing
Freedom to insult someone because of their skin colour, belief in a God or lack of a God.        Why the Hell should hate be protected?
Freedom to voice your political views.                      Super, do it.
Freedom to voice frustrations at companies that you believe are corrupt.     Awesome do it loud and proud, force that change. 
Freedom to voice dissent against Police policy                                                     Do it louder and more
Freedom to speak your opinion about flat Earth as a teacher in a School........ unless you can back it up with empirical evidence no, lies should not be passed down to those seeking an education
Freedom to teach creationism...... great so long as it is taught in a way that makes it obvious this is a belief not hard science.  

It is messy at first and it will always be messy to regulate, but being able to teach those in your care whatever comes to your mind is dangerous, and in the case of Media hammering our rhetoric over and over and over the audience is in their care just as much as the 6 year old is in the care of a teacher in a school in the bible belt.",1,2021-01-17T16:46:03Z,2021-01-17T16:46:03Z

@Shohaiko,"You have to look at these problems objectively, which this video fails at. At least in some parts, I am not criticizing your views, only the video.
You tried to paint the whole crowd as White nationalist, Nazis, Facists, Rich business owners and not the working class. The examples you showed were very hand picked out of the sheer number of people who were at the capitol. You based this video on hating all of the people who attended the rally, for example with the rich woman. You use a strawman, which is just an argumental foul. Just statistically speaking most of the people that stormed the capitol were working class trump supporters. It doesnt excuse any of their behavior. I wouldnt ever defend trump supporters, or trump, or to be honest most traditionally Right-wing or Traditionally Left-wing groups.
Why i have a gripe with your video, is that It is separating and radicilizing people when what the world and mainly the USA needs is unity. Try looking at the problem that way next time. I get that you have an agenda, but right now America needs unity much more than a Left wing or a Right wing majority/political alignment.",0,2021-01-17T16:15:15Z,2021-01-17T16:15:15Z

@fiandrhi,"The leftist idea that you're going to build a party to the left of the Democrats is more delusional than QAnon.  Who exactly are you going to people that party with?  The most you'd succeed in doing is dividing the left between the center left mainstream democrats and the far-left, leaving the right with an overwhelming plurality.  What an utterly stupid idea.  

I grant you that, as leftists, you're destined to be disappointed, probably for the rest of your lives.  You're just going to have to make your peace with that.  Short of a Marxist revolution in the US (which simply isn't going to happen), you're stuck with the system you have.

Rather, why not take a page from the Tea Party?  They found themselves with a Republican Party that was too far to the left for their liking.  In 15 years, they transformed that party into a far-right party and succeeded beyond anyone's expectations pushing an agenda that was deeply unpopular in a democratic system.  

How did they do it?  Well, they didn't do it by telling everyone to vote for the Libertarians every four years as a ""protest vote"".  No, they forced GOP candidates to the right with primary challenges, got the farthest right candidate they could and then put everything behind them in the general election.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.   They did this at every level of government, and it worked.  

They did other things, like pushing their message with think tanks, media, and grassroots organizations.  They also litigated.  And they created draft legislation which they took from state to state to push their agenda at the state and local levels.  

They scarcely bothered with street protests.  They left that to the left, because they know it looks like doing something while doing very little.  It keeps the left happy and stupid.  

It's been the most remarkable revolution in American political history, and had they not been so stupid about it, they'd still be winning handily while the left holds ineffectual protests and votes for third party candidates that the right secretly fund and encourage.

By lumping in, you make it hard for anyone moderate who might want to check out the left, so they end up going right and unfortunately the right has been moved to the far right or just looney land by the extremes, and by reacting to the extreme left.  On the left you have the same thing happening.

The Court held that conversation and occurrences long prior to the indictment were admissible evidence on the question of defendant’s intent. And more important, it held that the constitutional requirement of two witnesses to the same overt act or confession in open court does not operate to exclude confessions or admissions made out of court, where a legal basis for the conviction has been laid by the testimony of two witnesses of which such confessions or admissions are merely corroborative. This relaxation of restrictions surrounding the definition of treason evoked obvious satisfaction from Justice Douglas, who saw in Haupt a vindication of his position in Cramer. His concurring opinion contains what may be called a restatement of the law of treason and merits quotation at length:
“As the Cramer case makes plain, the overt act and the intent with which it is done are separate and distinct elements of the crime. Intent need not be proved by two witnesses but may be inferred from all the circumstances surrounding the overt act. But if two witnesses are not required to prove treasonable intent, two witnesses need not be required to show the treasonable character of the overt act. For proof of treasonable intent in the doing of the overt act necessarily involves proof that the accused committed the overt act with the knowledge or understanding of its treasonable character.”
“The requirement of an overt act is to make certain a treasonable project has moved from the realm of thought into the realm of action. That requirement is undeniably met in the present case, as it was in the case of Cramer.”
“The Cramer case departed from those rules when it held that ‘The two-witness principle is to interdict imputation of incriminating acts to the accused by circumstantial evidence or by the testimony of a single witness.’ 325 U. S. p. 35. The present decision is truer to the constitutional definition of treason when it forsakes that test and holds that an act, quite innocent on its face, does not need two witnesses to be transformed into a incriminating one.”1490

@Soul-zl6bb,"IN 2016-2020, D. TRUMP WAS THE LESSER OF EVILS
Here’s my argumentation.

1. “GOP values” are stupid and evil, so if D. Trump did not represent them, that’s good.
2.  “Democrat values” aren’t better – there’s political convergence, and you can hardly distinguish a democrat president from a republican president.
(Do politicians have values, or do they just pretend and are they opportunistic?)

3.  The best thing D. Trump did was preventing H. Rodham from becoming US president.
The worst thing about him is that he makes other politicians look better.

4.  Trump is a symptom – of a malfunctioning democracy. The good thing about a symptom is that it shows there’s a sickness.

5.  Trump lied constantly. So do other politicians, such as Rodham. The difference is that Trumps lies were obvious while other politicians are good at hiding them. 

6.  So it is good that D. Trump became US president in 2016. And it is very good that H. Rodham did not.

7.  Media such as CNN are co-responsible for turning Trump into what he was as president, by kicking him into the ground 24/7 52/y.

8.  Trump was a goldmine for CNN – ""Feels good, us kicking Trump into the ground, doesn't it? Keep watching!""

9.  However, 4 years of Trump is enough, 8 years would be disastrous – because of the climate emergency. That is the decisive argument.

10.  Still, it remains to be seen if the Biden government will do better on climate. We cannot take politicians word for that. Trudeau of Canada politically correctly endorsed the Paris Agreement, yet goes on with the ecocide of exploiting Canada’s dirty fossil fuels. Trudeau is a hypocrite.

11.  Please check these clips for some of what my points are based on.

Bernie Sanders is one of the few good US politicians  –  therefore he didn’t stand a chance, as Trump correctly observed five years ago.

Meanwhile, you seem to be a lot harsher on the Republican party and Republicans in general (rightly so in some cases I might add) which shows a clear bias and doesn't clearly display the flaws that both parties have and the actions of both parties and the people who support these parties have taken to get to this point. Let me state for the record that the assault on the capitol was horrendous and too many Republicans didn't look at what the actual objective of the assault was close enough. But at the same time, you have to take into account that many of the people who did join in on the assault assumed that it was a seizure of the capitol building to support the things that Republicans have been saying for years. Things such as ""Blue Lives Matter"" were started because many Republicans and former police officers saw the needless violence towards officers and not enough identification and persecution of the officers who were abusing their power. As someone who can say they've talked to many officers, quite a few don't speak up against corrupt police because of the fear of losing their jobs and a way to support their family as a result rather than it being a movement to justify ""police beating BLM protestors."" And in more recent times, things like election fraud during the most recent election where at 4 am states turned blue even though the counting was supposed to have stopped. Something which in my opinion, the left didn't justify hard enough to the American people which only caused more Americans to lose faith in the system than there already were.

My point is, both sides are just as guilty for this kind of political violence and both sides need to do something about it if they don't want it to happen again. And for analysis on a topic this sensitive, it seemed that your research was filled with too much bias for me to take seriously.",1,2021-01-17T11:03:26Z,2021-01-17T11:03:26Z

@frostyinf5170,"While I agree with most of the analysis made in this video, but I feel you missed on two points. 1) Trump did nothing for his supporters.  You looked at this almost strictly from an economic standpoint.  The racist policies he executed and division he amped up by blaming everything on the left and the media is exactly why the love him and want him to remain in office.  They loved banning Muslims (Arabs), targeting Latinos (blocking asylum seekers, extreme deportations) and caging their children, labeling BLM/Antifa as terrorists, removing White Supremacist/Right-wing extremists from terrorists group identifications, supporting Confederate leaders and their statues, fanning the flames of ""the culture war,"" allowing Christian Nationalist preachers to advocate for Republican politicians and retain their tax-free status, telling WS to stand back and stand by, etc, etc. 2) The left-wing is just as susceptible to censorship by ""Big Tech"" and the government.  Marching for Medicare-for-all is nowhere close to equivalency to storming the U.S. Capitol & insurrection, and thus will not set the precedent that left-wing activism being treated as domestic terrorism, even if Biden passes anti-terrorism legislation.

I do agree that Biden is a neoliberal, and found his statement that America needs a strong Republican party is absolute trash.

@dubdoesgams1144,"As a moderate conservative the Capital riot was very uneeded. I believe that some of the riots throughout 2020 were quite bloody on both sides of the events. The overall message of the BLM protests last year was good and it was needed, but the burning of cities and businesses was uneeded in those times and caused the current bad economic climate from coronavirus even worse in the regions that were heavily affected. All I can say is that at least the Capital building wasn't burnt down. And I believe that the modern Republican party is entirely flawed and needs to be rebuilt with a proper moral base and with the lives of the American people need to be our first instead of the corporate greed of the parties. Possibly with a more overall moderate government and political spectrum maybe we could finally have some national unity but I doubt that would happen anytime soon within the next decade. Before the rioting at the capital I was iffy with Trump, but after his support towards the riots, I rather would've never seen him again. I am rather disappointed with the political party that I have supported for a long time has entirely degraded into a state of total fanaticism, and a lot of it has to do with a lack of education and holding onto the past of what America used to be. I can vouch for a good bit of people by saying that a lot of Republicans want to see the old America the one that fights for what the overall nation believes in, but America is fading out of the global picture more harshly than I once thought. Those rioters holding the Confederate Battle Flag are genuinely brain dead retarded because it truly isn't even that actual national flag of the Confederacy, but I digress.

@jasongibson1225,"I disagree with the narrative that we need to eliminate the Republican Party.  

Not because I don't think they are going too far right, not because I am some Nazi sympathizer, but only because we have no choice but to find some common ground with the Republican Party.  

To get rid of the Republican Party would require secession. That is the one and only practical way to get rid of the entire party.   Otherwise, they are here to stay for decades to come, and we will never see the day they are completely ousted.  To believe in ousting the Republican Party without bringing up secession as an option would require an even more aggressive police state.

I see what Biden says less as a quiet acceptance of the wrongs the right does, and more the acknowledgement that the only choice we have is to bring the Republican Party back to a worthy rival and skeptic, not a gaggle of morons that seek domination by any means necessary.",0,2021-01-17T06:16:36Z,2021-01-17T06:17:56Z

@hungchieutam4214,"WHY WAS CAPITOL UNDER ATTACK 
We may have a lot of analysis for the event that the rebels attacked the US Capitol Building, but there is one best answer: who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind.
The Capitol has become the place that formed the hostility between the two American political parties, not a symbol of democracy anymore. These two parties do not put the benefits of the country first, but only find ways to bring their own party members to hold as many seats as possible in the parliament. If they occupy the majority of seats, manipulate American politics, they will receive  some hidden interests from such a victory. The hostility of the two parties takes away the meaning or ideology of the party they had proposed long in the past.",0,2021-01-17T06:03:51Z,2021-01-17T06:03:51Z

@QueerVisions,"There's a modern common usage of the word fascism (with a little 'f') that is generally what people mean, for the most part, when they use the word. When people say MAGA red hats are fascists, they're not implying Trump supporters are somehow trying to ressurect the political regime of Mussolini's Fascisti (with a capital 'F'). The broader meaning of fascism is any ideology, movement, tendency, etc, that may be characterized as right-wing, chauvinist, authoritarian, and often racist. Any system of strong autocracy or oligarchy usually to the extent of bending and breaking the law, race-baiting, and/or violence against largely unarmed populations. The alt-right are modern day fascists. Donald Trump is a fascist. His MAGA red hats are, more and more, fascists. The Proud Boys are fascists, etc.",1,2021-01-17T04:52:24Z,2021-01-17T04:53:46Z

@kassandrapatrick9064,"I left a like because I thought this video was really well done with very fair and interesting arguments. That said, I disagree with a couple things. Firstly, this was an attempted coup. Just because it was badly done and a lot of the people there were too caught up in the fact that they even got into the Capitol (And who could blame them? They should never have been able to get in! Even they knew it!) to cause real damage, doesn't make it not a coup attempt. There were definitely multiple people who not only had plans but also enough clout to potentially direct people to do a proper take over. Elected officials and off dury cops were there. There was a real chance of much worse had the mob been allowed to stay inside the Capitol for even longer. Secondly, I believe Trump should be impeached. You are 100% right that propping Trump up as ""the true cause"" is bad and is a way of side-stepping very real problems concerning the Republican Party and the American populace. That said, not punishing Trump in any way for inciting violence sets a dangerous precendent of its own, especially considering we are nowhere near out of the woods. A smarter and more cunning politician with Trump's charisma and the same horrible beliefs is a real possibility four years from now. We need to hold people accountable. Sure, impeachment is a bare minimum, but it's better than doing nothing. All that said, still a good video I hope to ahare with friends and talk about.

@asdkotable,"""What will keeping Trump in power accomplish?"" I think, especially for the poor, Y'all Qaeda type, they want to keep Trump in power because he legitimizes their bigotry, egotism and lack of empathy for others. Trump, unlike other presidents, tells them straight to their face that it's good to be uneducated, full of hate, and small-minded, that they're ""good people"" and that people (like him) love them, instead of ignoring or condemning them. That's why they want him to be their president for life.",28,2021-01-17T02:55:27Z,2021-01-17T02:55:27Z

I'm as scared of state abuse of power as the next guy, and looking back to BLM protests still makes me sick to my stomach based on how the people were treated. But despite the violent negligence of police, there weren't no-fly orders. There weren't manhunts.

I also hate to fail to point out how this guy is completely oblivious of the war of 1776 not for the reason of MORE government invention but LESS government due to their tendency of over reaching power. While you hit the point on the head that people tend to rebel against higher level of government invention from the military arms, you failed to mention, people also hate the government getting involved socially since it leads to more death overall and you can't even answer the more basic question of what is an acceptable level of equality.",1,2021-01-16T22:16:13Z,2021-01-16T22:33:39Z

@MrRoberacer,"Ok. I am watching this and the comment about ANTIFA and dismissing their involvement is my issue but not the way you think. No-one ever heard of ANTIFA before Trump brought them to our attention when he added them to the International Terrorist Watch list. My issue is this. At which BLM protest did ANTIFA say they were going to join? It is my understanding that we never actually heard from them and the only source of the involvement at all was the right and particularly Trump himself. In fact it doesn't seem that BLM members really know who they were either. Then along comes this event and a buried story from the Washington Post citing how a company who specializes in facial recognition software fed the pictures of some of the key insurgents in the Capital attack into their system. It turns out the computer spit the guy with the antlers out with some interesting findings 1. He was a known White Supremacist, a ""Proud Boy"" but 2. He was a or the leader of another group called Qanon and was also reported to be the leader or ANTIFA. I would like to see this actually dug into by authorities but it is my working theory that he really is all of those and that leads us back to Trump's claims of ANTIFA starting the riots during the BLM protests. We should note that BLM repeatedly swore that they were not choosing to be violent at all and indeed in other countries like mine they have not. Also in my country (Canada) ANTIFA was nowhere to be found either. It is also interesting to note that as I pointed out to a few people that as ANTIFA's roots are that it was a label the Nazis put on dissidents anyone who is really ""anti fascist"" could be labelled as one and indeed most of my countrymen could be in fact labelled as such as we are an extremely democratically polarized people.

@lamborambo6384,"So this is what passes as nuance these days? 

He simply asserts that antifa had nothing to do with it, offering no evidence (that’s impossible to “prove” anyway, but proving to the contrary IS possible) and then he says that it was definitely Trump supporters. Because, well... there were Trump supporters there!

Ok, yeah, there were Trump supporters there, no one is denying that. But, they weren’t the ones breaking windows with shields and batons. That is a pattern we only see one place... the left. All the videos show MOST of the trumpets shouting at anyone doing that and/or trying to physically stop them from breaking the windows. But if you see it on tv, they take the sound out and talk over it...

Did some trumpers go inside? Yes. Were they encouraged to do so by other? Yes. Were they helped by people inside the building? Yes. Were they allowed in by security guards outside, after taking selfies with them (in some cases)? Yes. Were there blm people there too? Yes. Is the FBI releasing information that runs contrary to the mainstream narrative the news propagates? Yes. 

Even Nancy is talking about that now. But of course, she’s being very shady about WHO it was and stating that THEY will pay, certain that they can just force any loose ends to disappear and make it all for the narrative they’ve started in the long run because no one reads official information anymore anyway and instead let the talking heads on “official news outlets” think for them. Even training with them double speak like “Trump supporters only listen to the news outlets he lets them listen to” ... amazing

Also, a lot of what they’re blaming on T Rump, started before his speech was even over. Meaning the people who were there listening, could NOT have been the same people who started the rioting and it therefore was not caused by what he said. Ya know... the whole reason for the impeachment... lol 

I mean what did the democrat controlled senate, congress and presidential office have to gain by helping to orchestrate this amarite?

There are already examples BEFORE the 6th, of motherflowers mixing themselves in with peaceful demonstrations and then causing a bunch of damage to make everyone there look bad. It does happen. And guess what kind of damage they did... But just like with voter fraud, all of sudden, it’s not possible for that to happen... lol 

People went there with that intention. There is proof that there were non Trump supporters mixed into the crowd and very few people ever became violent. Maybe some of them even were Trump supporters, but even if ALL of them really were, remember the blm and antifa riots? Those did get violent and chaotic and people died there too. Just like that was not the initial intent of those demonstrations, this was not the intent of the demonstration on the 6th. And just like how those riots do not represent everyone on the left, the actions of a small group of people in the 6th do not represent everyone on the right. But dammit if Pelosi and her constituents don’t talk about it like it does. Only to be parroted of course by the mainstream,  trustworthy and unbiased media. 

This is not even a new tactic:

@TheMundusvultdecipi,Excellent analysis. I agree wholeheartedly except your claim that the Reps pulled the Dems as far to the right as ever and that the Dems haven't formed mobs yet. Ultimately it boils down to a public education problem and of course the political two-party system and everything that comes along with it is a huge problem in such a polarized diversed nation. In a system with multiple parties and where they have to form coalitions to get a majority I cannot really see how someone like Trump could come into power let alone have the vast power the POTUS has in the current system.,0,2021-01-16T21:23:06Z,2021-01-16T21:23:06Z

@methos1999,"This was probably the most thought provoking video I've seen covering the Capitol riot/mob. While I'm not a huge fan of Biden, I do think it would be missing a major opportunity to write him off to the degree you do. Where he is very much a centrist and as such is malleable to where the Democratic party stands, putting pressure on the party from the left will help getting much needed changes in government policy. 

As far as the tech companies are concerned, I think there is going to be some major changes coming there. You can't piss off people across the ideological spectrum and expect not to become a target of legislators/regulators.",0,2021-01-16T20:58:46Z,2021-01-16T20:58:46Z
@FruitloopLeviathan,"Here’s my take:
I voted Biden and consider myself a centrist. 

This video has the intention of explaining the events of the Capitol Hill riots. The problem is this video explains it in such a way that it has become itself the reason why the riots happened. Bear with me. 

First of all, the rush on Capitol Hill is in no way acceptable. This out of the way, why did it happen?  Trump has been elected through populist means. It’s the first time in many years that a president addressed identity politics without the boundaries set by corporations, mass media, universities and other majority left wings institutions. Even though Trump was an exceptionally bad president, many of his most devoted supporters don’t want to go back to the status quo that is political correctness. 

In fact, through all the waves of the riot denunciations, we can see the manifestation of the leftist hypocrisy which led to the inflammation of the right. Your video has done just that. 

First off, this video assimilates the whole right-wing as an extremist movement. You said at 23:00 : ‘’We're letting Republicans off the hook for what has become mainstream conservative even though Trump is not an anomaly’’. 

Then, you also denounce America's political duopoly in another video by saying at 9:55 : ‘’’ I would love to vote not for the lesser of two evils’’. 
Why wouldn’t that apply to republicans who would also like more options than Trump at the 2020 election? Voting republican does not mean that someone is either an extremist or an avid Trump supporter just as democrats who vote Biden unwillingly. The use of the word evil also shows you see politics as a fight between good and evils instead of a battle for ideologies. This is a dangerous point of view because means against evil is much more drastic than means against an ideology. Extremists are extremists and they are not synonyms of either democrats and republicans. 

Back to the riot video, you say at 28:00 : ‘’People will always try to judge things by universal metrics’’. It is indeed a widespread cognitive bias. The problem is you denounce this bias and end up using it yourself. 
You stated at 30:00 :‘’ Where half of the Americans choose to cast their lot with bigots, racists … and literal nazis’’. 
You are reducing half of the population to a few extremists. You are deeply contributing to the division of this country by inflaming the right-wing who are allowed to exist without being labeled right away as a nazi. 
The fact is you also manipulate information to your advantage. On America's political duopoly video, you said: ""Ever wonder why we don't get real impactful climate change legislation even though it's supported by the vast majority of Americans?"". Where is your ""vast majority of Americans"" who support climate change if ""half of the Americans choose to cast their lot with bigots, racists … and literal nazis’’? It simply doesn't make sense. A vast majority of Americans believe in climate change because Nazis are a very small minority that cannot be accounted for the whole of the Republican party. 

In this order of idea, you have been discrediting the republican party all throughout the video. 
First, you say: ‘’The republican party… is a lost cause. It has shifted so far to the right‘’. Well, in your other video on America's political duopoly video, you clearly state your support for Bernie. 
You also stated at 28:44 : ’’Consider why other nations rise against their leaders: to oppose against crippling austerity; to demand better healthcare or necessary reforms. Always things that materially improve the lives of the vast majority of citizens. ’’. This is a purely leftist point of view. 

Now, what gives you the credibility to tell if the Republican party is a salvageable or lost cause? The evidence is the disappearance of the republican party would satisfy your political intentions. 
You did say: ‘’The Republicans have dragged the Democrats to where the Republican party was three or four years ago.‘’.
So, nor Trump's Republican party today nor the much more rational Republican part of thirty years ago is considered right for you. Your ideology is clear and you are in no position for either speaking in the name of the Republican party or as an objective point of view since it has been clearly demonstrated that you affiliate yourself with the left. 


In reality, the US is deeply divided because the left-wing has made political debates into a battle between good and evil. Thus, they are trying to discredit half of the population’s opinion. The left-wing being deeply rooted in corporations, mass media, and university, they are able to set the tone of the political debates leaving the right with no safe space for their ideas even though the average Republican isn’t an extremist. The populist movement that is the election of Trump showed just how inflamed the right is and many of them have radicalized themselves in the past years due to the unfortunate reaction that is the election of Trump to the left’s hypocrisy. 

This video has been covering itself has an objective description of the Capitol Hill riots and ended it up being a trial of the Republican party and the right-wing. We do not need this kind of elocution in such a tense political state.",1,2021-01-16T20:54:37Z,2021-01-16T21:02:11Z

You're right the rest of the world is watching, and it's so obvious to everyone outside what a mess the country is in now.

So obsessed with capitalism and anti-communism that they are letting the wealthy absolutely destroy the country.

One thing that all countries need, but is especially in the US is a better voting system that allows minority parties to gain traction.  See CGP grey's video about the problem with our current FPTP voting - every country ends up in a 2 party system that with our current voting system will never be broken.

As you say in the US you now only have either a far right party, or an extreme right party to choose from, that's it.  There is nothing even close to central, and left is so far away you can't even see it.  With both parties playing off one another to keep the rich people rich and keep the poor downtrodden.

US needs to realise that the republican v democrats thing is just the rich people in power playing a game with the population like fools.  They need proper reform, and  proper voting system that reflects what people actually want.",0,2021-01-16T17:10:18Z,2021-01-16T17:10:18Z

This comes from an idealism (""The Free Market Place of Ideas""), a moral relativism (""Who are you to claim they are all wrong"") and an accusatory association with dictators if we chose to forbid the existence of these beliefs. Point is, these people do not live in the real world and they twist and bend everything they have said to believe in previously if they can get their way in the moment (realpolitik). The solution really is to suppress their movements and beliefs with all means available.

As long as both parties insist on creating a government that only works for the top 1% and fund those policies by taking from everyone else, these things are going to happen.

@LordLobo52,"Dude, I appreciate your take, but you fail to mention how close the mob was to intercepting congress before they were evacuated. It was very close to being something much more than “America’s dumbest day” and imo it is a little misleading to frame it as this. As you said, at least some of them were planning to take hostages and they were within minutes of possibly doing just that. Sure, who knows what happens after that, but you also kind of glazed over how 5 people died. You say “This was basically a riot but what did they actually do once they breached the capital? Took pictures and chanted a little.” Well they charged a guarded door, leading to a fatal shooting. Within minutes of the evacuated congress, who had members in its ranks tweeting certain other’s locations. AOC said she had an undisclosed interaction where she literally thought she was going to die. The rioters chased cops, CHASED COPS, up stairways and through the halls of congress. Im just saying, there was more to happened inside than you indicated and what happened was not unimportant.",75,2021-01-16T14:48:18Z,2021-01-16T14:55:27Z

@carcher5432,"While it's obviously worrying that the government will use the same tactics against leftists, and we DO NOT need a domestic terrorism bill, especially one worded that vaguely, I feel like the specific point about ratting out people who participated in the attack was a bad take. They may not have all been there with specific plans, but they all wanted to overturn the democratic results of the election. That is inherently anti-egalitarian and against everything we should be pushing for, which is the issue rather than that ""the state says they committed crimes."" Just because the state is in favor of something doesn't mean we need to be against it. If the state wants to charge people who actively participated in an attempt to overturn the election and would do everything in their power to oppose our efforts to make the country more egalitarian, I say that's a good thing. I don't want the state to have that power, but as long as they do I'm not going to say they shouldn't use it in positive ways. 

Also, I don't agree with the idea that we shouldn't call it a coup attempt just because they were unorganized or unsuccessful. If we can only call it that once it is successful, then it would be too late. The individual people involved with it are ridiculous, as are their supposed justifications, but they came extraordinarily close to doing significant damage and we shouldn't minimize that.",14,2021-01-16T14:36:26Z,2021-01-16T14:36:26Z

@j_niuton,"Hey first of ty, I overall liked the video, I really did. I found it nformative and I am also gonna start checking your other content now. Nonetheless, there is one thing that I really really disagreed with, and that was that after the chapter 2 anylisis on who were the people that stormed the capitol, one of the closing statements was that the Republican base are ""misguided workers swindeld by a cult of personality, wealthy business owners, cultist and elected officials"", when I dont see any evidence for that. I believe it is an extreme overstretch. I see evidence that there is a large group of extreme RADICAL Trump supporters which clearly are conformed of that base, but who dont necesarily represent the conservative one.  I find it missleading to conclude from it that the WHOLE republican base is composed of them. Not saying that it is true or false, but that by the information of this analysis alone, I could not make that affirmation. I find that in the end it ended up being the same trap that the left and right always end up using with each other.

Some ideas are as bad as cancer and should be treated as such when your mind is so full of hate that you can admit your wrong then all you'll ever do is try to convince others your right and seeing as how a large portion of people will never be able to admit they are wrong we are in for a rough ride and if you think that Vladimir Putin didn't see something like this coming then your probably a Trump fan in hiding! Think about it Putin has seen numerous mobs like this and he was apart of a government take over in Russia and a member of the KGB and then he clawed his way to becoming the ruler of Russia the man is a specialist in these types of tactics and Americans everywhere were wondering what exactly did he receive from helping Trump win the election in 2016 and the sad part is it'll never be mentioned by the news media or anyone else and Trump will never face charges of treason and all this did was allow foreign governments to see ways of destroying our nation from the inside simply find one of those rich business owners in that crowd and place them in a position of power to eventually run for president and rinse and repeat keep doing it enough and America will burn to the ground while the world cheers,0,2021-01-16T13:59:29Z,2021-01-16T13:59:29Z

@tsunamio7750,"8:50 ""Most of them were wealthy conservatives""... OH, so I guess we had a concentration of the 10% most wealthy people of America in one place? That's stupid.

""Minorities can do no wrong and whites are always the baddies"". That's all we see on the media and it is disgusting. ""Mostly peaceful protests"", ""Religion of peace"",  CHAZ: ""Summer of love"". Major repetitive offences are barely unpunished in left-leaning states because the protesters were on ""the right side"".

I think people ought to be worried about their future and the future of their kids when they are humiliated when the death of people alike are being ridiculed and laughed at on social media. When so many people tell you that you are bad or ""privileged"" for being born with the wrong skin colour... ""and you have to pay for it"".

Crazies attract crazies. What I worry about is that, wherever you look, left or right, blue or red, all we will have left is a bunch of crazies. The nest has been poked with for too long and the media is responsible for it. Mainstream or not.

When you see the number of death by cops every year compared to the population, it's minuscule, yet ""cops are all bad, whatever they do."" That's one good example.. But the one-sided take on hale of the population, the humiliating and shaming of half of the population is a pretty good example too.",0,2021-01-16T13:15:13Z,2021-01-16T13:34:48Z

@JM-bb8xi,"To be fair, CHOP/CHAZ was also fully endorsed by liberal elected officials.  Those rioters killed more young unarmed black men then the police.  As for BLM Protests being a blood bath, who did they kill at a protest/riot? I know a few instances of ""protesters"" killing people there. The Capitol PD actually killed one of those rioters.  As for not having enough of a response, this was the first trump rally to turn into a riot. So they probably werent expecting it. Where BLM/Antifa have a well documented past of violence at demonstrations. 

These riots are not a 1 sided issue, legitimate BLM Protesrts degraded into riots, fairly often. Now we have Right Wing Riots, and Left Wing Riots. Both are wrong, violence is never justified. The DC riot is particularly serious in that the president is involved. 

I get you're a ""leftist"" from your about section, im a libertarian, the sort of guy who thinks LGBT rights, and the second amendment. The guy whose been complaining about smaller government and the police state for decades.

 The Republicans have gone BATSHIT CRAZY, and Trump committed Treason, and should be held accountable. 

Calling the Dems ""right wing"" sorry, that's not it. Dems have their mob, its called Antifa.  Leftists are censored more that the right? Thats an outright lie! All the media is left leaning (except fox, which is more if a comedy show tbh)

Be careful not to turn into the Leftist version of what you're criticizing.  There are bad police, we hear about them all the time, we hardly hear about good folks, because good isnt noteworthy its just expected, so why ever report on it. 

The far left is just as dangerous as the far right. And ill leave you with this argument. 

Why is it left wing people say the government abuses its power, but always call on it to grow? You think a bigger stronger government will ""defund"" police? The police are the government monopoly on force, thats why we need the 2A, its for the left and the right.  If leftists like you keep advocating bigger government and social change backed by the force of the state, you are no better than those you are criticizing now.  

It starts out with good intentions, a more equal society, but at the end of the day its still gonna police/government forcing social change and discouraging free thought.

@petersmythe6462,"I think in terms of class composition it's roughly the same demographics as ever hard right coup attempt. Most people there are gonna be professional-managerial or petite bourgeois. Not necessarily capitalists with millions to throw at things but not working class either. In rich, post-industrial, imperialist countries, this class/element of a class is both large and contains elements which are *THOROUGHLY* reactionary. Combine with veterans and you have a large, armed, dangerous mass base who still very much feels outcompeted from above and stuck under a glass cieling of facelesscorporatocracy, yet also feels unstable and vulnerable to the working class from below. The result is the rise of the radical right. Angry at Bolsheviks and bankers and lacking class analysis but believing instead in conspiracy, will to power, etc. Of course this is not purely organic. This petite bourgeois reactionary trend is the result of collaboration with powerful elements of the national, not the imperial, Bourgeoisie, in an uneasy alliance against both their own workers and the internationalistic elements of the Bourgeoisie. Of course they still rely on imperialism. Don't be naive. But they don't make their money there. They make it by exploiting the poorest, most oppressed elements within the USA.

@junglecat_rant,"I don't know how America's definition of fascism is. Living here in Germany in a democracy after WWII our definition of fascism is the open admiration of a political figure as their 'leader', ultra nationalistic (for example 'America first'), anti-communistic, anti-democracy, non-pluralistic, overly appreciative of the military AND the will and determination to enforce those beliefs with brute force views and policies. Usually politically speaking the political ideology is on the far-right spectrum.
The best definition how to describe the GOP that I'm aware of is an authoritarian belief system with fascistic markers.
In our country we do have laws that gives authorities the power to keep track on extremist groups (right-wing, left-wing, religious extremism) while using intelligence tactics regulated by law and rules to prevent overreach. There is a bipartisan oversight committee (all parties) in our Parliament (Bundestag) and there is an annual report available to read for every citizen.
For you to assume that if a similar kind of law would be introduced by the Biden-Administration it would deminish your rights to protest any political issue you see fit is speculative. You haven't read the law yet.
Every open democracy - based society in my opinion has the right to know if extrimist forces are working against it's society and try to corrode the system from within. I personally don't feel pitty for people that got their name on a no-fly-list because they use violence as a tool to express their political beliefs. They can still use a car or a train. And if they need to fly professionally then they should have been thinking about that beforehand.
My belief is, and you can call it naive, that even if you are leaning to political fringes you can express your opinion and found organizations if you don't use violence as a tool and your actions are in the norms of the Constitution. If you leave those norms intentionally you can't expect to be accepted by an open democracy and society.",1,2021-01-16T09:11:39Z,2021-01-16T09:11:39Z

@travelingjohn69,Whites as a collective don't respect peace. They respect dominance. I say as a collective because look how they acted when they didn't get their way and look how many supported them. The types of people who stormed the capital have the mentality of White dominace. There is no bridging a gap with them. I rather be devided in truth than unite under a lie. There is no bridging the gap with those who want to maintain racial injustice and throw a fit because they don't get the election results they want. How much did blue lives matter at the capital hill? And the late impeachment of Trump is just symbolism. Democrats been running games of symbolism on Black people for years. Love this video.

@tonis8131,"Great video. There is, however, measured analysis that this was, indeed, fascist-led and an attempted coup, in ways, even if they didn't have a clear plan once they got inside and were waiting further orders from Trump. I think the threat of further violence was quite serious - even if there was this element of pure idiocy (""dumbest day in America""). This officer they beat and threatened to kill with his own gun (that footage was him - MIchael Fallone - not Sicknick) was a big signal to me about where this could have led. And while they were looking for Pence, Pelosi and McConnell? - I think some bigger concerns are around how quickly this could have turned into a lynch mob going after progressive black women and minorities elected to the House, with some reporting that the emergency alert buttons in their offices had been disabled. Ayanna Pressley, for ex. And some Berners like to think none of these people were interested in a populist styled politician like Bernie Sanders, there were even Bernie supporters who became Trump supporters - but frankly, I'm skeptical. Those Berners-to-Trump are a small group, and fascists can turn very quickly on socialists. He's just not their main concern ""at the moment."" But they'd get there, make no mistake about it. So .. while I'm hearing Second Thought about the overuse of the term ""fascist,"" I'm also concerned that we don't underestimate what's going on, here, either. (FWIW I'm a Berner from 2016 and 2020 - I went 3rd party after each primary.)

Naive in the sense that it's so charicaturely evil, like every president is this scheming evil Mastermind whose sole ambition is to make the world a worse place, or that Republicans are incapable of anything good, even if their party restricted itself in the wake of this to something better than it is, or even outright redefines itself, or that the reason Joe said a ""strong"" Republican party was needed was so that he could have a scapegoat to blame for failings.

@PHILMKD95,"Yeah right, never mind the BLM and Antifa riots during last Summer of 2020 that lasted for over 100 days in just about every Democrat City and State over some guy who OD's on fentanyl before being apprehended by cops and the media calling the rioters and looters peaceful, the corporations backing and funding, supporting BLM and their obvious anti-American Marxist Social Justice agendas, NGOs and multi-national corporations and the mainstream media establishment encouraging people to loot, burn, steal and attack and even kill innocent people who have nothing to do with the police.

There is NO comparison between Pro-trump and the Radical left, this is not up for debate.

I do not condone violence, neither by the left or by the right.

The same people that say and preach that All Cops Are Bastards (ACAB) for short, Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, Defund the police, are now all of a sudden are in favour of the police, right when their holy cathedral in Washington D.C,  the Capitol building was allegedly stormed with rioters breaking in and loaded and armed with weapons, besieged by whom you might say, by unarmed protestors, by the majority who elected the president who knew and witnessed during the election that something was not right, not just the fringe or far right groups, whilst the very same republican senators cut a deal with the democrats to steal the election and stab Trump in the back who betrayed the President, but people after the incident when several people were killed for what, entering after being let through by authorities, the local authorities know that conservative Republican and Independent supporters/pro trump supporters are NOT HOSTILE AND ARE PEACFUL, the know they have a right to assemble and civilly disrupt the process to voice their opinion and their concerns.

What you saw in the capitol is nothing compared to past riots, civil unrest and insurrections that have taken place in majority blue states, particularly states that have been corrupt by the Democrats for DECADES.

By the way it's the radical left wing groups that are all in favour of censorship, fascism and socialism, they want more government intervention, control of all institutions manipulation and interference of the electoral systems in every state.

Remember when all of Washington D.C was set ablaze, people's businesses looted and homes burned to the ground and the Governors did NOTHING?

The problem with this though is that the cost of health-care was not nearly as high as it is before obama care, a flawed yet democratic policy. It was of course high before but at this point is so crippling high it's laughable. I'm not sure how the way republicans have treated health-care policy is a reason for them being disbanded. Another issue is what about Guns, Abortions, Minimum Wage, Taxes, and of course Health-care. These all are the main reasons a lot of people vote the way they vote. When a country has white supremacists those white supremacists are going to vote. I fail to see how say me(not a white supremacist) voting for the same candidate as a white supremacist makes the republican party a bad party.

@PeterEhik,"My greatest fear is that the general American populace will never be able to tell the difference between people protesting for justice vs people protesting to overturn an election and install a fascist leader. I haven't seen the mainstream media particularly try to make that distinction very clear to regular folk. Instead all they're doing is talking about how evil people are for storming the Capitol building as if the real problem is the manner of the protest and not the reason for the protest. 

Sometimes shit's gotta burn for things to change, no police officer would've been arrested in Minneapolis if the protesters didn't burn down the fucking police station. Civil disobedience is good for a democracy, when you live under a state, there's always a power struggle between the people and the state. The state seeks power over the people in return for security and order while the people fight to ensure that the State provides its side of the bargain without completely infringing on individual freedom. That dichotomy has moved too far towards the state in the last 20 years and I'm afraid these Trumpers have given even more excuse to the state for them to stomp down on us. Whatever anti-terrorist bill that comes out of this ordeal is gonna be bipartisan and when something is bipartisan in modern America, it never benefits the people.",0,2021-01-16T03:23:26Z,2021-01-16T03:23:26Z

See, these rioting morons, like their prophet, do understand congress does not control the US, corporations do.

As for freedom, censorship and surveillance, this is complex, and you are mostly wrong. See, the issue is not surveillance or censorship, but he wields these power and to what purpose. This is where further division of power in the government is needed. We need to split most of DoJ from the executive branch, including the FBI.

@Charles37400,"I will say i havent watched the video yet but i will be giving some criticism when im done as i was at the capitol riot with some conservative family just because i knew from the start there was no way this was ending well. Ill edit this post if i see anything wrong or that needs further explanations. If your wondering i never went inside the capitol but i did stand on the front lawn of it and saw the protesters getting in from far below

Edit: honestly halfway through and i dont have too many corrections to make that arent just me nitpicking which suprised me as heavily political channels tend to bend facts. Good job so far

14:14 while i will say there was certainly those people, at the rally itself and on the lawn of the capitol the majority of people were normal people.  If they are misinformed im not sure, but its important to remember that not all of them were theese awful groups, just like how we on the left always have to argue against claims that we are all communists and baby killers and such. The people that entered the capitol were likley the worst of the worst in thr bunch. Most people didnt want to get much closer than the lawn.

25:55 this isnt a criticism but i will say i did see one man holding a gay pride flag in front of the Capitol. I congradulated him for his bravery im waving it at a Republican protest and told him to ""fly it with pride."" Just a positive little story of a brave guy at the rally

Conclusion: 8/10, quite accurate though with a slight bias, but with good evidence for most solid claims so very good",0,2021-01-15T23:18:01Z,2021-01-15T23:56:01Z

@PianoForteKitty,"I have seen a lot of platforms claiming people have been put on the 'no-fly' list for what happened at the capital, from what I've seen from official channels this is not true. The videos posted in airports are due to FAA heightening regulations against those who do not follow heath-safety regulations and from those who cause plane delays. Not saying whether that is good or bad, but at least it is more related to the fact that Trump supporters are less likely to follow COVID health guidelines and not related to whether they were at the capitol or not.

From taking away overtime pay and making you work off the clock? (a lot of dollar stores and fast food places already do this and get away with it). Or getting rid of minimum wage comepletely?
These gov crackdowns might make it harder for bad things to happen, but they do the same with the good things too. Especially since the definition of domestic terrorism is vague at best.",0,2021-01-15T22:40:51Z,2021-01-15T22:40:51Z

@Perl88,"The UK and the US are close cousins politically and it’s worth watching both to see where we are going next. 

We are both now in the same position. The Democrats/Labour are centrists at best and the Republicans/Conservatives are moving further to the right. It’s a scary time that we now live in and it wouldn’t surprise me if we see something similar happen in the UK if the “left” ever get back into power again. 

If you want a quick history lesson in how the UK ended up like this then read on: 

We went through the lurch to the right under Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government (1979-1990 and continued under John Major till 1997) and haven’t moved from that position since. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s New Labour “centre left” government (1997-2010) continued on with the housing market boom which has caused average house prices to spiral from 3-4x average earnings to 8x average earnings, didn’t replace the social housing sold off under the Conservatives which has caused a housing crisis and expanded the PPP/PFI contracts that allowed private companies to build and maintain public buildings such as schools and hospitals on up to 30 year contracts that are extremely overpriced and are a massive burden on the state to pay off. To top it all off we sided with Bush under our so called left leaning government to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Today we have been back under Conservative rule (since 2010) and house prices are still high, we had a failed Scottish Independence vote where both Labour and the Conservatives stood arm in arm along with all of the main stream media barring one Sunday paper to oppose, had Brexit which was backed by many right leaning newspapers and political parties and have record amounts of people using food banks (before the pandemic hit, it’s now even higher) and of course this was caused mainly by austerity measures after the 2008 financial crash which the Conservatives started implementing in 2010.

Labour did go back to a left leaning leader in Jeremy Corbyn (2015-2020) who went on to lose two elections. This was mainly due to his weak stance on Brexit, the media using red scare tactics and repeated attempts for his own party members to stab him in the back or undermine him. 

It would be a good thing to have a strong left leaning party in the US and the UK but it will be an uphill battle.",0,2021-01-15T22:36:22Z,2021-01-15T22:36:22Z

@randommaniac796,"Good video, but one minor disagreement was that the implication people shouldn't report people who rioted at the capital to the FBI. And I get, I don't like them either, but this is one of those times in which it is warranted, because there is concrete evidence of what they did (provided by the rioters themselves). And if your concern is that it would set a precedent that, and this is where you kind of lose me, could potentially lead another Red Scare, then I myself don't see that connection. It is a possibility this could happen again, but I don't see how this is the precedent that could lead to that.

Still, maybe I'm too optimistic, but the Capitol Rioters, in my opinion, are being treated harshly because the DC police fucked up and embarrassed the Federal Government. Also, what happened on Jan 6th was way more extreme and disturbing than anything a BLM protest produced in the last 9 months. They're a far more dangerous faction of extremists than BLM protesters by and large (not that I'm calling BLM extremists, that's just how some media outlets frame them), and I think the Feds are finally waking up to that. The Capitol Rioters got what was coming to them, IMO.

I just don't understand how people think this ego centric super rich billionaire actually genuinely cares about working class people.. or anyone other than himself for that matter. Especially looking at the policies he has implemented. Peaceful non-violence promoting discussion is the best way forward all the time.

If I learn of the location of a serial killers hideout, I shouldn't tell the cops and just leave a slasher at large to claim more victims? These are people who attempted sedition for gods sake, we can't just let em go free or who knows what they could do next. And 'some of them were not very committed/organised' is a poor excuse.

I get being against government abuse of power. But going so far as to let serious criminals off the hook for their crimes, cause you hate the feds more, is just stupid.",0,2021-01-15T21:00:15Z,2021-01-15T21:05:15Z
@brody5409,"""Biden dedicated to maintaining the status quo, and that mean continued pandering to massive corporations and crippling austerity for the rest of us"" that's just, not accurate. Biden has put forward a nearly 2 TRILLION dollar plan to help battle COVID including raising the federal minimum wage to $15, rental assistance, and child care programs. Yes, Biden is a very moderate candidate, but to act like nothing would change between a Republican and Democratic controlled government is to deny the truth at the very best, and Republican apologetics at the worst.

Whether or not they did anything to indicate a coup is not necessary, as their intentions were to overturn the election results, and stop the certification of the electoral results. It obviously was not an effective coup, but it was a coup attempt nonetheless. Their actions do not dictate their intentions, as most of them, again, were at that rally and subsequently the capital to keep a loser, authoritarian president in power.",5,2021-01-15T20:39:51Z,2021-01-15T20:39:51Z

The Jan 6th Capitol riot events were horrific, disgusting and every one that broke the law ought to be prosecuted federally to the fullest!  There are thousands who think and believe like me.  Do I think the election was stolen?  Well, very strange things were happening that can not be explained, (stopping the count at 99%, suitcases stuffed with ballots appearing after 2am & counted behind closed doors, Trump massive rallies and biden 20-man rally......dominion offices shutting down......) when msm and dems refuse to even address these strange happenings, people will think it was stolen. If the dems blame Trump for the Jan 6 riots, then they are also to be blamed for the BLM riots, destruction and arson.

Now for veterans they hold on the history of their military service. We also very much take pride in their service. And we do not like to learn that they were trucked, lied to, or that their opinion was wrong. Also like the businessman disabled veterans like myself and many of my brothes. Get paied by the gov.

With every new video, when I see how dedicated you are to speaking out the unbiased truth about the state of the US and the larger world, and when I see how hard Youtube tries to suppress your videos each time, my admiration for you and your channel grows.

PS: Did the Homeland Security actually pay you a visit for ""anti-Americam sentiment""? If so, wow... I advise you to watch out for yourself. I may be overly alarmist, but I really wouldn't want to see you in a news coverage about a supposed suicide or heart attack.

@tagguh1,"Suppose that these strategies and tactics of suppression (No Fly lists, asking people to ID people, surveillance, etc) are turned onto leftists, which I fully support your belief that they will be, what then? How do you even hope to fight that? You yourself were visited by DHS and that's awful and stupid, honestly. DHS is a joke if they consider your videos unamerican IMO. They're a joke anyway but I digress; How do you resist an overbearing empire that has surveillance technology the world has literally never seen before? 

I don't think the average American even cares much less wants to change the way our empire accumulates governmental power. The military budget and Three letter agency budgets expand more each year and ergo gain more power over whoever they direct their targeting towards. I dont think the average American even knows who key figures are in politics much less the intricacies of the surveillance state and its budget. 

So what is the solution? Is there one? Violence? Grass roots organizing? Attempting to create a new party or infiltrating the Dem party and trying to change its internal policy making procedure? That seems to be whats happening now albeit at a snails pace. AOC and the squad are considered radical leftists but by all measures elsewhere in the world they're centrists and they're ridiculed for their beliefs as being so radical that they're impossible. I agree with your points and I love your videos but I find myself thinking: Well? What is one to do?

@JamesMiller69,"Would you leave America if you could, comfortably? 

Slowly over the last 5 or 6 years that answer for me has grown ever closer to ""yes"", but after everything I've seen these past 10-11 months, that yes has become resounding.  Staying in this country makes me feel dirty, or morally disingenuous. There are so many people, places, and things to love about America, so much culture and talent yet to be bastardized, so much history, genuinely positive impact and bounds forward in entertainment and science. 

But the future looks bleak. 

Slowly but surely the bad has started to outweigh the good. I'm scared, tired, and so absolutely overwhelmed with disappointment and a feeling of helplessness. 

Capitalism is a disease, it's taken so much from us. Even from the people who have been ideologically manipulated into defending it to their wits end. I wish people could see past their own pride, and stop defending the systems that keep them broke, ignored, unfulfilled, and angry.

@ThatGamerDude9000,"For the most part I agree with this video. Using that clip of the guy saying ""we are the business owners,"" to say that the people there aren't working class is a little flimsy. Business owner doesn't mean corporate or rich. Someone owns a pizza shop is a business owner. Someone who owns a record store is a business owner. Mom and Pop shops are run by business owners. While they make more than their employees, they aren't wealthy by any means. And due to the few amount of people they can afford to employ, the business owners are also workers in their shops, doing the same job as their employees in addition to management (e.g. Louis Rossman). Small businesses have been pushed too far by the greedy corporatists in Washington too. A lot of small businesses don't own the building that they use for business. They rent, and rent for commercial land is a lot higher than rent for residential land. Landlords for commercial spaces have their hooks in politics a lot deeper than residential landlords and use their political connections to fuck over small time working class business owners as well. I believe that there are neo nazis, white supremacists, and wealthy people in that crowd, but I think there are working class business owners who were gullible and believed Trump was doing something good for them, and fighting big business politics.",3,2021-01-15T16:06:01Z,2021-01-15T16:06:01Z

I mean, people had been discussing this over social media and other platforms for quite some time, and seeing people walk into the Capitol with zip ties and other weapons is alarming to say the least. With that being said I think the only reason there wasn’t maybe as much of a pursuit of our elected officials is because 1. They got evacuated at the right time because these nazis did in fact get into the chamber and 2. There were law enforcement with guns outside where the elected officials were hunkered down. This isn’t to say that I am excusing any kind of law enforcement response to this since they should have never been able to get inside the Capitol during a house and senate session in the first place, but it is to say that this should be called an “attempted coup” because though it wasn’t successful and probably didn’t have much chance of being successful, it was definitely still an attempt.

@ki11aqueen5,"I hate both sides but you can't deny that the left have been having non stop rioting for the past couple months. Billions of dollars in damages to their own communities. Black owned businesses were ruined due to looters fighting for ""justice"" right? A black police officer gets shot over a fucking TV in the name of ""social justice"" right? But no backlash for these people right? No ""no fly"" lists for these people? No investigation for the left when they took over a part of the city in Seattle? No backlash for democratic politicians who kept and KEEP lobbying for the ""peaceful protests"" to keep happening. Like why is one side deemed to be the most evil side while the left have done the same if not even worse than the right. But everyone on the left wants to act like they have the moral high ground some how? 

I hate politics and I know its just a bunch of empty air that comes out any politicians mouth but the double standards I see towards the right is crazy. Now we have censorship taking place mostly for the right, while we have democratic politicians get no slap on the wrist for promoting the decapitated head of Donald Trump.

He took advantage of his followers, harnessing their populist anger and blaming all of America's problems on a few scapegoats: liberals, immigrants, ""Antifa"", radical feminists, socialists, etc. (the usual people conservatives hate). 

America's politicians could not call Trump out on his bullshit because that would mean pointing out the REAL cause of America's problems: the greed of the rich, the immoral rapaciousness of large corporations, and the financial corruption of the political system by powerful donors and corporate lobbying. Bezos and Musk made have billions of dollars during the pandemic, mostly through stock market bubbles, while the ""essential workers"" get screwed with low wages and expensive health care costs. The funny thing is that liberals think getting rid of Trump will solve any of the underlying problems, but it will not, it will only make the problems WOESE as desperate, misinformed, vulnerable people realize Trump was NOT EXTREME ENOUGH. The next Trump will be worse. And the media (especially cable news and unregulated conspiracy-prone online forums) is exacerbating the problem.",1,2021-01-15T15:20:03Z,2021-01-15T15:20:46Z

As much as I don’t like our politicians. You don’t threaten their lives and overthrow the government. Peace over Violence. Trump needs to be convicted, this is treason. Those rioters are the same confederate that fought against the United States in the Civil War. They are a disgrace. I’m not a fan of Biden, but I’m so glad he won, he dosent wish to divide us as much as Trump. Fascism will kill Democracy.",29,2021-01-15T15:08:02Z,2021-01-15T15:17:16Z
