@engmission,"One of the most alarming things about Syria is that most people can't give you a clear summary of who any member of the opposition is, what they stand for, who their allies are, or why they're fighting. The very mention of the word ""Syria"" throws people into a myopia that defies all historical or geopolitical context.

Indeed, the nucleus of any discussion in The West is simply ""Assad Must Go!"" without any consideration as to what the alternative is or what regime change would mean for the Syrian people at large. Erdogan, who is still clandestinely trading with Israel, has played an active part in trying to balkanize Syria for well over a decade, yet no one is questioning why militants with links to al-Qaeda are suddenly pouring into Syria from Turkiye immediately after netanyahu threatened Assad for aiding the Lebanese resistance?

Western propaganda has told you that solidarity with the Syrian people can only take the form of being adamantly against Assad. This line of thinking suffocates any space for critical thought and inquiry.

Even highlighting the well-documented US/Israel support for these rebel groups is immediately misconstrued as an endorsement of the current government. Not only does this poison the discourse, it conveniently services the imperialist agenda to balkanize Syria. Those who claim to be anti-imperialist are now voicing support for the US administered occupation of Syria.

QUESTION EVERYTHING!

Why did the IDF only bomb territory held by Assad and never the opposition?

Why does the US have untouched military bases in rebel-held provinces?

Why is it that the same states who are actively funding/aiding and abetting the genocide in Gaza are also feverishly pro-regime change?

Why are so many fighters for the Syrian opposition foreigners?

Will there be a resurgence of isis and other extremist groups?",0,2024-12-09T12:52:53Z,2024-12-09T12:52:53Z

@„Çä„Åì-k6n,"Currently ,¬†¬† Bible prophecy is being fulfilled . The Bible is a book of prophecy. Approximately 
30% of the Bible is about prophecy.
The earth is going to go through a time of tribulation.
The Great Tribulation¬† will be a time of distress that human kind has never experience before.
Earth will soon enter into this¬† time¬† of tribulation, and 
Bible prophecy wil be fulfilled.
True christians¬† (saved from sin by Jesus¬† )„ÄÄwill be raptured,
(lifted to heavenby Jesus)
but merely nominal¬† christians¬† 
(those who are christians in name only ) will¬† remain 
on the earth. 
The second prophecy tells that 
Israel will be attacked like 
never before .
as¬† far¬† as¬† what happens first,
the order of prophecies 1,2,&3 might change.
1. All Christians in the world will disappear at once.
You might get an image of that if 
you watched the¬† movie
""LeftBehind "" but 
I think the Rapture will be incomparable¬† to the movie.
The movie cannot be compared 
with reality when the Rapture occurs.
2. Damascus ,the capital of Syria,will be destroyed.
3. The countries of Russia,Iran, and Turkey will attack Israel.
God will miraculously give 
Israel the victory in this battle.
The rise of the anti- Christ will occur¬† when he is 
welcomed as the new world leader.
He will confirm a peace treaty with Israel for seven years.
This will begin the Great 
Tribulation, which will last for 
seven years.
The anti-Christ will lie to the 
world about why Christians
disappear. For example,
the anti-Christ might lie and say 
that extraterrestrials snatched 
people who don't believe
in aliens from outer space.
During the Great Tribulation there will be famines, desease,
epidemics and pandemics 
and many kind of natural disasters. During this era of time 
in human history, hardships 
will happen like never before
experienced by human beings.
The anti-Christ will cause 
the Jews to rebuild the temple
in Jerusalem.
This has been difficult to achieve.
The anti-Christ will also cause 
the Jews to restore the 
ritual sacrifices in the temple.
The false¬† prophet (maybe a 
Roman catholic pope )
will create and lead a one 
world religion. After¬† three¬† and 
a half years,the  anti-christ ¬† declare he is god, and 
make people worship him.
The anti-Christ will also break 
the peace treaty with Israel
after three and a half years.
The anti-Christ will coerce all 
people to take a mark of 666 in 
their right hand or forehead.
This mark might be a bar code 
or microchip .
The Bible says that those 
people who refuse to take¬† the 
mark will not be able to 
buy¬† or sell, and will be beheaded.
The people left behind who are 
repentant¬† Christians¬† will 
reject¬† the anti-Christ and his 
mark, so will be killed.
The people who followed the 
anti-Christ and took the 
mark of the beast will cast into 
the everlasting fire because
of God's forewarned judgment.
Those people who didn't 
follow the anti-Christ and who 
refused to take the mark of 
the beast, will go to be 
with God in heaven at last.
The Bible says that we should
never take that mark.
Jesus Christ's second coming 
will be at the Mount of Olives 
at the end of the seven 
years¬† of the Great Tribulation .
Then Christ will begin¬† 1000 years of His earthly 
Kingdom.
Bible prophecy has been fulfilled 
in the past, but there is also 
still more that the Bible says¬† about¬† prophecy that will 
be¬† fulfilled¬† in the future.
Now, currently, today¬† is¬† the 
time to accept God's saying 
grace, before the beginning
of the Great Tribulation.
Those¬† people who believe that
Jesus Christ died on the cross 
for their sins, they will go to 
heaven¬† to be with Him .
Believing this is the priority 
above everything else.
I hope that many people will 
choose this before it's too late.",0,2024-12-09T09:03:21Z,2024-12-09T09:03:21Z

@ky365tv,"If South Korea's President Yoon Seok-yeol is impeached, South Korea will inevitably become communist!! The reason is that opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is a spatialist who is advocating the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and praising North Korea's Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un. After President Yoon Seok-yeol took power, he realized that the entire South Korea was occupied by communists by former President Moon Jae-in, a pro-North Korea supporter, including broadcasting, media, prosecution, police, and investigative agencies. In order to correct this, he declared martial law, which is the inherent authority of the president guaranteed by the Constitution. However, even his own junior Han Dong-hoon, the party leader (a pro-China communist), whom President Yoon Seok-yeol cherished, betrayed the president and installed all of his recommended people as his shams in President Yoon Seok-yeol's cabinet, the Office of the Chief of Staff, the Ministry of Justice, and all personnel, including the Chief of Staff, when he was the Minister of Justice. Now, all of South Korea's media is occupied by the communist organization, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (the largest single labor organization presumed to be the North Korean Communist Party).  The American media believes and broadcasts to each country the reports of the communist-controlled MBC, KBS, JTBC, SBS, CBS, and other YouTuber media outlets (90% of which are communist organizations) without filtering them! Their biased reporting is serious. Right now, the rally to protect President Yoon Seok-yeol is larger in scale than the communist candlelight vigil, holding the American and Taegeukgi flags at Gwanghwamun Rhee Syngman Square, shouting for the ROK-US alliance, Jesus Korea, gospel unification, free unification, and market economy. The opposition Democratic Party, which colluded with China to become the majority party with 190 seats through a fraudulent election, is an anti-state force that has deceived the people with lies and propaganda more than 20 times and has cut the entire government budget to 0 won!  In this situation, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law to protect the free democratic Republic of Korea and the people in a situation where the country is on the verge of collapse, but the leftist soldiers are disobeying the orders of the President, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, not moving, informing the opposition party's traitorous forces, and attacking the President from the opposite side of the President. The President is banned from leaving the country by anti-state forces, is being branded as illegal martial law, and just like the witch-hunt-style impeachment of innocent President Park Geun-hye, President Yoon Seok-yeol, a believer in free democracy, is now in a situation no different from being imprisoned! In order to protect President Yoon Seok-yeol from anti-state forces, the patriotic citizens of the free Republic of Korea are fighting with tears in their eyes, holding the American and Taegeukgi flags, and with Pastor Jang Gwang-hoon at Rhee Syngman Square in Gwanghwamun for 6 years, rain or shine, against the anti-state forces, the communist Democratic Party, Moon Jae-in, Lee Jae-myung, etc. All free world media, including the United States, should not trust the media in Korea, which is occupied by communists.  Come out to Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, South Korea in person!! I urge you to meet Pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon, President Yoon Seok-yeol, and the patriotic citizens holding the American, Taegeukgi, and Israeli flags, conduct a direct interview, and then broadcast it as news. The Korean media is dead!! There is only false and distorted news„Ö†!! The president also declared martial law in order to correct this point and root out the fraudulent election, which is the flower of democracy, but then canceled martial law according to the law against anti-state forces! World! Help President Yoon Seok-yeol of the free Republic of Korea! Please help the patriotic citizens of the Taegeukgi who have fought the communists for 6 years in rain or snow at Gwanghwamun Square in the free Republic of Korea for the sake of freedom and democracy! Every week, we hold worship services on the streets, and every Saturday, we fight the communist Democratic Party (communists! Opposition Party) with tears. I appeal in the name of God!

@2gointruth,"Beware of all religions. ‚ÄúYou shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at John 8: 32) ‚Äì God is our true Father in heaven and on earth. 
So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. 
‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.
In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.
This is how you should pray:
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Your kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,
Give us today our daily bread,
Forgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.
And do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.
For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.
Amen.
For if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (Jesus the Messiah at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì

‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì

‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì

‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.
The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì

‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì

‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì
‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì

‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì
‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì

‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì

‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì

‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì

‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì

‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì
‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì

‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì

Yours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Monday the 9th of December 2024: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

This is rather comical how Russia / Putin did Trump a solid by Trump not having to pocket veto a US Congress supplemental spending bill to the 2025 NDAA because of a resurgence of the Syrian civil war.  Obama's Syrian rebels to the rescue to rain on Republicans' parade.

New Senate Leader John Thune must be having a melt-down behind closed doors as he now must start from scratch to concoct another theater of war in his upcoming tenure's middle east War On Terrorism money laundering campaign funding scam. 

Iran and Russia are moving their chess pieces while Republicans scramble to start up a money laundering war operation to fund congressional mid-term elections in 2026. Democrats used Ukraine for their 2024 Democratic Party campaign fund money laundering, which is why Trump will shut it down.

This will be exciting to see what role China and India will play in this 3 dimensional chess match. By the looks of it, Russia, Iran, India and China have a already discussed plan for Trump.

@EduardoArtistaDelavega,"One of the most alarming things about Syria is that most people can't give you a cogent summary of who any member of the opposition is, what they stand for, who their allies are, or why they're fighting.

The very mention of the word ""Syria"" throws people into a myopia that defies all historical or geopolitical context.

Indeed, the nucleus of any discussion in The West is simply ""Assad Must Go!"" without any consideration as to what the alternative is or what regime change would mean for the Syrian people at large.

Erdogan, who is still clandestinely trading with Israel, has played an active part in trying to balkanize Syria for well over a decade, yet no one is questioning why militants with links to al-Qaeda are suddenly pouring into Syria from Turkiye immediately after netanyahu threatened Assad for aiding the Lebanese resistance?

Western propaganda has told you that solidarity with the Syrian people can only take the form of being adamantly against Assad. This line of thinking suffocates any space for critical thought and inquiry.

Even highlighting the well-documented US/Israel support for these rebel groups is immediately misconstrued as an endorsement of the current government. Not only does this poison the discourse, it conveniently services the imperialist agenda to balkanize Syria. Those who claim to be anti-imperialist are now voicing support for the US administered occupation of Syria.

Why does IDF only bomb territory held by Assad and never the opposition?

Why does the US have untouched military bases in rebel-held provinces?

Why is it that the same states who are actively funding/aiding and abetting the genocide in Gaza are also feverishly pro-regime change?

The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, in order to prevent the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria.
The operation struck over 75 targets using multiple U.S. Air Force assets, including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s.

@Starofmylifecrexnfe,"Tomorrow is not promised, were here today gone tomorrow.¬† Life is like a Vapor.¬†¬†

The Bible says;¬†

Proverbs 27:1 NKJV

[1] Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth.


James 1:11 NKJV

[11] For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.¬†


Job 8:9 NKJV

[9] For we were¬† born yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth are a shadow.


Job 10:19-22 NKJV

[19] I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave. [20] Are not my days few? Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort, [21] Before I go to¬† the¬† place¬† from¬† which I shall not return, To the land of darkness and the shadow of death, [22] A land as dark as darkness itself, As the shadow of death, without any order, Where even the light is like darkness.


Job 16:21-22 NKJV

[21] Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, As a man pleads for his neighbor! [22] For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return.


I plead with you! Please read and have your soul ready.¬†¬†

The bible says, if you believed with your heart that Jesus came from heaven, died on the cross and rose on the 3rd day, seen by so many people, ascended up into heaven and promised He is coming for those who put their trust in Him and call upon the name of the Lord you will be saved.¬†¬†


You see the bible says also, that only Jesus blood can cleanse us from all our unrighteousness and His finished work at the Cross is more that enough, we do not have to do anything but fully trust in Him alone, and by faith alone, trusting in His powerful Blood, the blood of Jesus the one true God. Jesus loves you, and mercy and grace is ready to those who are willing, and realized for themselves, we are nothing but a dust.¬† Only Jesus is the true answers to all our sorrows, pain.¬† Jesus will never reject you, the truth He died for humanity but humanity rejects Him (John 1:1-11).¬†


That is all you need to do, no good works can give you salvation, the truth is after you understand please! repent. What is repentance? repentance means to turn away or to change your mind. Then accept with all your heart Jesus is Lord, He is the Only way, The only Truth, The only Life (John 14:6) says, and believed.¬† After you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior of your soul, then your good works will be accepted and with the pure heart you will pleased God.¬†¬†


The Bible says;

I Corinthians 15:3-4, 6-11 NKJV

[3] For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, [4] and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,¬†

[6] After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. [7] After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. [8] Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. [9] For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. [10] But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which¬† was with me. [11] Therefore, whether it¬† was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.¬†


The Bible says;¬†

John 1:12-13 NKJV

[12] But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: [13] who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.¬†


If you decided and believed in Jesus finished worked at the Cross of Calvary, and believe He alone can set you free, congratulations! You are now part of the family of God.¬† Welcome! Your heavenly bound when this life is over or when Jesus comes to Rapture the church.¬†

God bless.",0,2024-12-09T00:39:07Z,2024-12-09T00:39:07Z

@rmmmizan6817,"¬© Rise Up, Seek the Light of a New Dawn

At last, the might of Russia and Iran faltered,
failing to uphold the tyrannical Assad regime.
In chains of governance devoid of divine guidance,
the faithful's hearts ignite in eternal revolt.

Now the question looms: whose fall is next?
Who will vanish, scattered into the dust of history?
The tales of downfall cast shadows of despair,
conquering hope, sowing seeds of fear.

But remember, destiny is no mere game of chance;
the power to shape it lies solely in your hands.
Without the illumination of divine truth,
only the poison tree of division will thrive.

Why forsake the oath of unity once held dear?
Your strength is deep-rooted, bound by ancient heritage.
Why drift upon currents of sorrow?
Within your grasp lies the promise of a new dawn.

Awaken! Seek the sacred path.
Let the light of truth blaze bright in your life.
Under the banner of unity, let equality sing,
and peace rise like the sun across the skies.

Now is the time‚Äîlearn from the past, step boldly ahead.
Craft your future with your own hands.
May history witness a fresh morning born of your resolve.
Illuminate life with courage and truth‚Äôs enduring flame.",0,2024-12-09T00:24:37Z,2024-12-09T00:24:37Z

Their spirits had already use blood of lamb Jesus christ to sign legal contracts with my spirit is holy spirit so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book so Abraham died and all the prophets died is proof their spirits had already sign legal contracts with my spirit uses blood of lamb Jesus christ .


Since their spirits said their spirits are inside blood of lamb bridegroom jesus christ so my spirit shall sign legal contract with their spirits so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book so apostle Paul said unpardonable sin in bible book so their spirits had already sign legal contracts with my spirit use blood of lamb Jesus christ.  

Their spirits know my spirit said flesh birth flesh and spirt births spirt so flesh profits nothing because flesh cannot give life to spirit but it is spirit gives life to flesh so faith without deeds is dead faith so too flesh without spirit is dead flesh so my spirit seeks vengeance so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book so Abraham died and all the prophets died is proof their spirits had already signed legal contract with My spirit use blood of lamb Jesus christ. 

Since they said their spirits are inside jesus christ flesh and only my spirit is outside so my spirit agree to sign legal contracts with their spirits use blood of lamb Jesus christ is legally binding so on that day many shall said to me lord lord,  did my enemy children spirts not sign legal contracts with my spirit use blood of lamb Jesus christ so I shall tell them plainly get away from Me you evil doers because my spirit had already signed legal contract with their spirits use blood of lamb Jesus christ is legally binding so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book is proof my spirit is innocent is honest spirit is honourable spirit is God in heaven is holy spirit is word of Jesus christ.  

They spirits said they are inside jesus christ flesh so I had agreed to save only 1 immortal human flesh so John baptist said they are inside jesus christ flesh God is true God and eternal life so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book so my spirit seeks vengeance.  


Did their spirits not said my spirit is evil spirit outside and their spirits are inside him is true God and eternal life so my spirit shall surely save him is true God and eternal life so my spirit paid death to their children spirts shall surely taste physical death because their spirits are inside him jesus christ so I shall save him jesus christ and I shall kill their children spirts shall surely taste physical death in exchange for him is true God and eternal life so my spirit shall be inside him is true God and eternal life so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book because many spirits shall blasphemy cheat my spirit is God in heaven before the day of Judgement so on the day of Judgement , when my enemy babies spirits know My spirit is God in heaven is proof bible book John verse 3-16 as it is written in their scriptures everyone eyes shall see him is proof flesh profits nothing because flesh cannot give life to spirit but it is spirit gives life to flesh so faith without deeds is dead faith so too flesh without spirit is dead flesh.  

Their spirits persecuted my spirit before the day of Judgement. Their spirits manipulated my spirit before the day of Judgement. Their spirits refused to give my spirit a chance to eat every word from my own mouth as jesus christ said man cannot survive on bread alone but every word from mouth of living God so their spirits bullied my spirit and their spirits refused to give my spirit a fair go. Their spirits are judges hate my spirit the only one law giver and judge who can both save flesh or murder flesh so Jesus christ said unpardonable sin in bible book is proof their spirits are judges spirits hate only my spirit the only one law giver and judge who can both save flesh or murder flesh is proof bible book John verse 3-16.",0,2024-12-08T23:32:52Z,2024-12-08T23:32:52Z
