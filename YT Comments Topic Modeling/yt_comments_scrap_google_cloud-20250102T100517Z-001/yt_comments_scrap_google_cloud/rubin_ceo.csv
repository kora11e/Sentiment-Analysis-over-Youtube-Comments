Agree the US shouldn't play a role in deciding who leads, BUT the US does need to cautiously talk with them to ensure US interests in the region are protected.

@jakekinzly5162,"To be fair, the legal system has shown extreme bias in recent years pending your political affiliation as well as going hard on you if your an easy target (poor and with no quality legal representation because its an easy win) or easy on you if you are wealthy and have an army of legal representation to the point most charges are dropped because its not worth the fight. 

You can see this all the time with the mega financial institutions where they don't admit or deny guilt but instead just pay a fine to make it go away... essentially paying what to them is like a parking ticket while they conduct a plethora of illegal actions that results in literally stealing others wealth because ""they set the prices where they think something should be valued"" while the regulators just turn the other way because they don't go after people unless they know they can win and that just breeds corruption and essentially a lawless playground for the wealthy to steal value from everyone else.

We need the law to be equal treatment regardless how rich or poor you are. Nothing should be off limits just because you can pay a fine and continue to do business as usual. We need real change and accountability that actually affects the wealthy where they cant just treat it like a minor nuisance or cost of doing business.",0,2024-12-11T02:22:24Z,2024-12-11T02:23:26Z

@jmatt4life,"What is the Neely dad talking about?
His son was a mentally unstable, career criminal, enabled by lack of parenting and an unjust legal system which permitted his barbarism.
This is George Floyd 3.0+.
Quite obviously, the family is trying to profit off the son‚Äôs unfortunate ending, a death which he chose.
The Liberal Left is fanning the flames of this racially/politically motivated bonfire.
The current administration has allowed our home grown TERRORISTS to pillage, maim, and kill without accountability.
What about the daily black on black crime?
Where are the protests for that?
There are enough B-O-B crimes to riot and pillage every day.
This all is about opportunity and potential profit for the Homeland Terrorists playing victims and the MSM shooting for views/ratings which aid and abet the Lefty Democrats and leads to their complicit revenue.
The Liberal Left is an entwined spider web of corruption and deceit which needs to be dismantled, thoroughly cleaned out and refurbished, including cooperative, guilty Republicans!

@HonestMan247,"Saying that Brian Thompson is ""completely innocent"" is... let's just say it's disingenuous.  I'm not saying it was right, but I understand.

And look, this is the same reason the 2nd amendment exists. - It's so that the populace can deter tyranny. If/when the day comes to push back against tyranny of the state, is the narrative going to be that <insert dictators here> are ""completely innocent"" and that everyone should lay down their arms and just file into the gulags in an orderly fashion?  We're supposed to wait for them to submit to a formal judicial inquiry? - How did that work out with Stalin, Mao, and Hitler?

My point is simple: There IS a time and place for ordinary men to take up arms - we've seen that time and again throughout human history. Was this an appropriate time and place? There seems to be some disagreement, and that's completely fine.

@davidmorley6986,"Just like the lefties you rightly criticize, you are parroting without analysis, in this case the ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù of the Canada-US trade imbalance. Once you exclude the energy and minerals trade imbalance, the massive amount of goods and services trade is roughly balanced, with a reasonable balance of manufacturing jobs.  The US imports of energy and minerals are employed to create jobs and wealth in the US that could otherwise have been utilized in Canada to create jobs and wealth, or simply sold elsewhere.  The US would then buy its energy and minerals inputs from other less friendly countries.  Hopefully, the US objective is not the subjugation and colonization of Canada to exploit Canada‚Äôs resources and kill its manufacturing, and to then sell to Canada the US‚Äô manufactured goods made from the inputs of Canadian energy and minerals.  That would be a return to the evil bullshit of colonialism like the 19th century banana republics that the US created.

@explorenaked,"I'm not going to defend insurance companies, but I will say this. It's a two-way street. People try constantly to defraud insurance companies. I know many people that have tried to get more out of the insurance companies than they are due. One example. I worked with a guy that got a hernia playing basketball on a Sunday. He fought the pain and went to work on Monday. Went into the warehouse and faked picking up a box and claimed he got the hernia at work so he wouldn't have any out of pocket. He committed insurance fraud and acts like this make our rates increase.",0,2024-12-10T18:10:12Z,2024-12-10T18:10:12Z
