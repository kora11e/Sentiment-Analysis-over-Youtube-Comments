@LMLewis,"This interview was a gross violation of journalistic ethics, a hit piece that tried to smear Mangione's lawyer and convict Mangione even before his lawyer has had an opportunity to view the evidence. The attorney points out that, under the law, everyone is innocent until proven guilty after due process, but Collins insists that she knows he's guilty based on a list of 'evidence' the government claims to have (but has not revealed), as if the government has never, ever lied about evidence or filed changes it later had to withdraw. It is despicable that any ""news organization"" would act like this. This video, ironically, constitutes evidence of collusion between media, corporations and the government to manipulate Americans into passively accepting oppression, injustice and inequality.",0,2024-12-15T17:20:36Z,2024-12-15T17:26:20Z

@MidinightBlue97,"As a pharmacy technician everytime I see a high copay (usually $100-500) I always ask if the buyer is aware of the copay, cant tell you how many times I hear people say ""Unfortunately, but I cant live without this"". I see diabetics being denied coverage on testing supplies and paying out of pocket, the insane prices of meds that they cant even recieve due to shortages, and some people that say they'll just have to go without the meds they need because the copay is so high. Its awful, these people already pay for insurance and then have to pay hundreds for medications every month. Cant tell you how many people cant afford Eliquis (a blood thinner), something they will die without. Ive seen several copays that are right around $500. When I worked at discharge pharmacy they gave the first months supply out free, there were bottles and bottles of it just sitting on shelves. So many people called back asking why the copay was so high and how they could get it at an affordable price, the only thing I could tell them is to call their insurance.

@LuBrown,"Hey CNN: Who's calling the defendant ""a kid from a wealthy family"".. That's heavy bias! Any room for balance and responsible journalism? Empathizers are not extremists. They are your non-elite audience. The majority of Americans are paying premiums but have been denied by insurance companies. This case is complex and involves significant medical considerations. The defendant experienced brain changes due to spinal cord injuries, leading to diminished capacity, as noted by neurosurgeons. As evidence, your video stated, suddently he went ""silent"". There is a stark contrast between his historically calm demeanor and his sudden shift to violent behavior, which suggests a profound impact on his mental state. His actions were driven by desperation to escape excruciating pain from surgery, not financial motives, as his family is wealthy, and he had no personal connection to Brian Thompson.
Those who knew him are surprised by his drastic change in behavior. The brain chemistry alterations following his surgery likely affected his mental state, leading to reclusiveness and potential feelings of hopelessness. It’s important to consider these factors before drawing conclusions. The legal system should take into account his diminished capacity and the context of his medical condition, ensuring a fair and humane approach to justice. 23:27: @timclemente.. your statement is a reflection of narrow monocular thinking. 25:37 Tim: listen carefully to this fact.

@PatMiller4768,"I’m sorry but you are so wrong.  The rage comes from something else.  I am conflicted because he comes from a really good and carrying family who although they had money, shared it and donated to numerous charities.  He has seen up close the realities of most Billionaires, millionaires and heartless rich who do not share and feel entitled to cause destitution and poverty to the everyday Americans who cannot get ahead because the road is blocked by the rich.  If he was trying to just murder someone for the sake of killing this man that alone would not move CEO’s and other “”filthy rich” entitled jerks to really care, I think inside he was sacrificing himself to try to get humans to wake up and see what the rich are trying to do.  Basically make poverty driven slaves of the rest of society.  I would say that seeing what Donald Trump is doing to Americans with his lust and greed for money is doing to our country and its government.  There was no other way to bring attention to this horrendous take over by the “filthy” rich and the destruction of our country and its people.  I don’t even think he necessarily meant to “kill” if, in fact, it was this young man who did this.  Rich Billionaires and CEO’s feel nothing for those they grift off of, but this might at least create fear for their lives, which I’m sure they deem as more important than most decent human beings.",2,2024-12-11T22:08:44Z,2024-12-11T22:08:44Z

Aren't security services aware of someone going on a website that explains how to make a 3D gun or your own bullets ?
4) Why is he first seen ""flirting"" in a greyish hoodie but using a black one during the shooting ? Was that greyish one found in the place were he was staying, establishing a firm link ?
5) Was he really a loner or part of an organisation, group, planning more actions (see 2) Is it really linked to his back pain or is he somehow linked to a rival health care insurance group or the mob or whatever ? Is he really the Robin Hood or Hooded Robin some silly Youtubers see in him ?

@JohnDurkin-ws8vv,"I have United healthcare and I am diabetic.When I started this plan I needed to get prior authorization for all of my medications.They continuously denied my my prescription for a continuous glucose monitor, something that has improved my health and well being tremendously.  I spent 4 months and recorded 21 calls with united healthcare to figure out why they were denying this medication. The reasons they gave me for denying this prescription ranged from improperly filling out paperwork to ""we are not sure that you have type 1 diabetes"" . There was no continuity in there responses, I could spend a day calling them and get 4 different reasons for why they denied the prescription. After all of this when I finally got the approval, the cost was 210 dollars, it cost 280 dollars at Costco without insurance. I have already stopped buying insulin needles through insurance because they want to charge me 45 dollars for a box that I can buy on amazon for 20. Me and my employer pay thousands of dollars a year to a company that promises to collectively bargain on my behalf to protect me from being overcharged in healthcare, they are actively doing the opposite because it is in their bottom lines best interest.  I understand that my condition is expensive, but that is just being used as an excuse to rip off millions of Americans that have no choice but to pay these inflated prices.Private healthcare is ripping off you, your employer, and the american taxpayers.

@jonathanthomaz6023,"“To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.”

@kontrygrll01amerika54,"What he is accused of doing was not ""good"", but it was to be expected that someone  would take action at  sometime. United Healthcare has the highest rate in the insurance business of denying healthcare to it's policyholders, a whopping 32%! It is criminal behaviour by a corporation and the CEO Brian Thompson was the one who backed using the computer algorithm that has left even patients with a Cancer diagnosis without followup care like chemotherapy.  How can UHC justify denying treatment for Cancer?  Tens of thousands of patients who have UHC policies have died from not receiving proper healthcare due to UHC's cruel actions. Actions meant to increae their profits on the backs of sick and dying patients. Their deaths can be laid directly on the shoulders of United Healthcare and it's CEO. When people pay good money for healthcare coverage they should be able to expect their medical bills to be paid for as outlined in their policy, not denied, denied, denied until they die from the medical condition not being treated.",2,2024-12-11T18:16:10Z,2024-12-11T18:16:10Z

@andiamador7156,"I'm not here advocating for murdering CEOs. I am advocating for moving to make our healthcare model have simple decency, be more like it is in other developed countries. Some people will lose some of their excessive wealth that gets generated for some shareholders if we move into the change, but they won't lose it all --- like a lot of people do if they get sick and get denied after handing over their money to people who will kill them with a pen, with their motive for it being profiteering for themselves and for their shareholders.

I'm not saying that this gunman needs to be upheld or that we need to see more of this, but everyone is saying they understand his motivation. It is a bipartisan issue for people out here in the real world. People having an illness to deal with, and people getting claims denied is not a partisan thing. So why do people vote against the people in the U.S.A. getting healthcare coverage like they have in other developed countries? 

Rand Paul fought against the U.S.A. moving to more of a Canadian model. He said their healthcare was substandard to healthcare in the U.S. --- however, when it came to his own surgery for a hernia, he went to Canada for it and paid the rich-foreigner price for it, which was cheaper than a co-pay/co-insurance here on some plans (he has some of the very best government insurance though, so maybe not on his plan...). Canadians get that surgery at the point of use for free. He got it in a timely manner. He chose the surgery in Canada imply because it was better, not because it was cheaper for him. There are videos about all of that for reference. 

Turns out, he lied about people-centered healthcare being substandard to profit-centered healthcare. Yet, people still vote for him and others like him.  U.S. healthcare is good enough for his voters, but not good enough for him, when it came down to it. That is one of the reasons why we can't have decency in the U.S, and why a CEO now got shot in the street over it. Lies and self-serving. 

People fall for the lies of politicians and others. They don't vote them out for someone better --- in the primaries (where it needs to occur), and they fall for all the manipulations from others who want to keep the profiteering going for their own financial gain.",0,2024-12-11T17:34:43Z,2024-12-11T17:34:43Z

@KMx108,My mom had an allergic reaction that inflamed her lungs causing so much coughing she pulled a muscle. Talking triggered painful coughing fits. The doctor prescribed an inhaler.

@opaqueandbluefrommyphone4339,"CNN correspondents ""reporters"" are completely detached from every day people.
They can't imagine a reason why anyone would want to celebrate the murder of a man who has told every one of their employees to REFUSE to AUTHORIZE LIFESAVING SERVICES, even services that could make their customers lives easier.
The ceo made sure that the insurance company he was in charge of only purpose was to be a BANK ACCOUNT for the CEO and EVERYONE IN CHARGE of UNITED HEALTHCARE.

Jesus, are they surprised that there was a coup in syria as well? Obviously they can't imagine why oppressed and people who have been taken advantage of and used would ever be upset at the assholes oppressing them and taking their money for services promised but necer fulfilled. Services meant to KEEP THEM HEALTHY!

Fucking hell CNN! Just waiting for you guys to start promoting Trumps dictatorship as being the best thing to happen to us in the history of the USA. Telling us why paying 1/5 of our income to the government and giving up our entitlements is something we should be celebrating.🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
No wonder trump fucking won. Our news media is telling us to celebrate being treated like shit and thank the people taking advantage of us and literally ruin our lives by denying us lifesaving services that we pay them to PROVIDE!

@jacobgenji5206,"The history of modern, civilised America opened with one of those great, really liberating, really revolutionary wars of which there have been so few compared to the vast number of wars of conquest which, like the present imperialist war, were caused by squabbles among kings, landowners or capitalists over the division of usurped lands or ill-gotten gains. That was the war the American people waged against the British robbers who oppressed America and held her in colonial slavery, in the same way as these “civilised” bloodsuckers are still oppressing and holding in colonial slavery hundreds of millions of people in India, Egypt, and all parts of the world.

About 150 years have passed since then. Bourgeois civilisation has borne all its luxurious fruits. America has taken first place among the free and educated nations in level of development of the productive forces of collective human endeavour, in the utilisation of machinery and of all the wonders of modern engineering. At the same time, America has become one of the foremost countries in regard to the depth of the abyss which lies between the handful of arrogant multimillionaires who wallow in filth and luxury, and the millions of working people who constantly live on the verge of pauperism. The American people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest, capitalist stage of wage-slavery to a handful of multimillionaires, and find themselves playing the role of hired thugs who, for the benefit of wealthy scoundrels, throttled the Philippines in 1898 on the pretext of “liberating” them, and are throttling the Russian Socialist Republic in 1918 on the pretext of “protecting” it from the Germans.

Justice Department or legislative failure to arrest and prosecute the victim is undoubtedly the void that made Brian Thompson vulnerable to targeted murder. Pundits want to isolate the heinous act from executive license to steal, directly causing deaths from medical neglect-for-profit, in order to shield those from other hot-heads or extremist types.

@JB-ed9jz,"You see there are two sides, those who condemn and those who sympathize the act. do you know why ? because murder is not the only criminal act here, when you rip someone off his/her right to get a fair and equitable healthcare that is also a crime. So this is why you see some people who sympathize and these sympathizers probably have had enough of seeing people not getting the healthcare that they deserve or possibly they  have first hand experience of being deprived of equitable healthcare when they or someone they love got ill.  so don't pretend to be shocked that there are sympathizers because it is not shocking at all. But I don't support any of these. I dont support what the killer did. But just as much I dont support depriving people of fair healthcare as well while someone's bank account is getting fatter. we live in a world with a broken system that's why things like this happen. money runs everything and that's why violence never stop. money over life.  look what they did with many people now getting stroke.  is that normal? healthy people getting stroke and dying.

At this point in time we only think about Luigi, trying to understand why he did it, feeling empathy because he has been hurt, he is young and charismatic, he represents the majority's views regarding the American health system, he is indeed a modern Robin Hood. However, once the trial begins and the other party will share an insight into the victim's life and their struggles and portray the victim as a father who didn't live to see their children grow and was killed from behind, I don't know how the jury and the world will look at this case.

It should give pause for thought, that is, the actual shooting and the delight that so many people took when they heard the news. Not to mention, the lack of help from the public. So, what does that tell you? You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand this---the system in US is totally rigged in fovour of the very weathly, who only want to get to wealthier and nobody gives a toss about those that are less fortunate and really struggling. As a starting point, this is not how christians should behave and almost everyone in US claims to be christian--they certainly bring religion and God into all conversations--including squeacky-clean Pete Hegseth, who has apparently ""found God"" and is a changed man--yeah, right! Until corporate and individual greed is tamed down, and wealth is equally spread, or, at least, the opportunity to create wealth for those at the bottom of the rung, these kinds of crimes ( of absolute hate and anger) will continue.

@Elcielotienenombre,"""‘In the U.S., we don’t kill in cold blood to settle political differences or defend viewpoints’? What an interesting statement from the governor. So, what was the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Or Abraham Lincoln? Or Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy? All of them fell victim to violence because of their political or social stances. U.S. history is full of examples where political differences escalated to the extreme of cold-blooded violence. Perhaps it would be better to reflect on how to prevent such tragedies from happening again, rather than denying the obvious.""
This reminds me of a quote by Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty:
""Everyone knows that within the structure of power, anything can be plausibly denied.""
This phrase refers to the ability of those in positions of authority or institutions to conceal, justify, or deny inconvenient or controversial facts in a way that appears reasonable or credible, even if not entirely truthful.
Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty (1917–2001)
Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty was an officer in the United States Air Force and a key figure in the U.S. intelligence community during the Cold War. He is best known for his work at the Pentagon as a liaison officer between the Department of Defense and the CIA, as well as for his controversial writings and statements on covert operations and the structure of power in the U.S.
Strategy: Plausible Deniability
Key Meaning:
1.	Plausible Deniability: This term, commonly associated with the political, military, and intelligence fields, refers to designing actions or structures in such a way that key individuals can deny knowledge or involvement in controversial events. This protects their reputation or shields them from legal responsibility.
2.	Structure of Power: In this context, it refers to how political, military, or institutional hierarchies are organized to obscure or dilute accountability. Information is managed so that only select individuals have full access, while controversial actions are obscured by layers of bureaucracy.
3.	Ethical Implications: The phrase also implies a cynical acknowledgment of how power dynamics function, where transparency is often absent. Instead of taking responsibility, the system seeks to preserve the institution's or individual's image and interests.
Practical Example:
Imagine a scenario in which a secret military operation goes wrong, resulting in civilian casualties. Leaders might:
•	Deny having directly authorized the operation.
•	Claim that relevant information never reached them.
•	Blame a ""failure in the chain of command.""
These tactics align with the concept of plausible deniability.
Colonel Fletcher seemed to recognize that within power structures, there was a machinery designed to protect high-ranking officials and allow them to distance themselves from questionable decisions. His statement has been interpreted both as a critique of the system and as a straightforward description of how institutions function in practice.",1,2024-12-11T07:36:24Z,2024-12-11T07:36:24Z

BOTH can be true at the same time.  Allowing anyone a pass to do what this kid did opens up our society to much more of it, with no fear of repercussions.

@mralexander99,"Shouting NOT Screaming……

Shouting To Be Heard
Is Not Screaming 🦅

Success is misunderstood and is misleading. 

Winning and Losing, Gain and Loss, Fame and ill Repute are positions of failure. 

Failure to clearly comprehend the dichotomies of opposites and its power to bind us to this never-ending narrative is claustrophobic. 

Capitalism’s success at making some of us billionaires while most of the population battles constantly to stay afloat is not a success for society nor for future civilization. 

The greed and the constant salivating of making more, more, more that continues to deliver less, less, and less is killing us.

 The corporate narrative is a slow dance towards the extinction of our species.

 Why was there revolutions in the past to overthrow monarchy, to overthrow emperors, to overthrow pharaohs, to overthrow those that have too much power while at the same time gouging, underpaying and exploiting those who actually do the work and provide the services?

 America itself has become blind to the people and caters to the rich. 

This is unsustainable in the long run. Besides which — how much does the rich actually need — is never enough. 

Here we are on the cutting edge of the 21st century continuing to repeat the same mistakes as the previous centuries.

Are we not Homo Sapiens Sapiens (Beings That Think And Know That They Think ie; Wise Beings)? 

So Far There Is No Evidence That We Are Wise — At All…

Except for Socrates, Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and Ralph Waldo Emerson plus a few others such as Rumi, Haféz, Mary Oliver and Simone Weil🦋

Our Way Of Life, Our Corporations

@Olivierhero,"It’s astonishing how the American system allows CEOs and companies like United Healthcare to legally sign death sentences for tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of people every year—all in the name of greed and profit.

Take drug companies as an example: they sell life-saving medications in other countries for $4–$5 per dose, but in the U.S., these same drugs are priced at hundreds or even thousands of dollars. These corporate decisions, driven solely by maximizing profits, are effectively death sentences for many Americans who cannot afford these treatments.

What’s even more troubling is the complicit silence of those who should hold these entities accountable. The government, the press, and especially the lobbyists, seem to turn a blind eye. Instead, lobbyists funnel millions into the pockets of elected officials to ensure the system remains rigged in favor of corporations.

This two-way system is broken: corporations are empowered to exploit and harm, while ordinary people are left powerless to fight back. Millions suffer and die in silence, trapped in a cycle of systemic neglect and unchecked corporate greed.

It’s time to question not just the corporations, but the systemic complicity that enables this injustice to persist.",1,2024-12-11T05:17:34Z,2024-12-11T05:17:34Z

'To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect
what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy
investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with
anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social
engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral
notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To
Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty
ocked down because I work in engineering so probably
not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites
simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1
most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet
we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the
[indecipherable] largest company in the US by market
cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown
and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is
these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful,
and they continue to abuse our country for immense
profit because the American public has allwed them to
get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex
but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to
be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument.
But many have illuminated the corruption and greed
(e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems
simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this
point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the

@dstreeth,This CEO is responsible for a large number of deaths - the American people have supported healthcare for all for quite a while only to be gaslit by politicians and news agency’s biased reporting on the topic.  It is infuriating.  So the question of why people are celebrating the murder of the CEO of the insurance company with the highest denial rate is not lack of compassion - it is American saying we can understand how someone could get to the point of committing murder because we have been screaming for something to be done to fix this backwards system.  Our cries for help have been shut down and our voices muted in every method available to protect these companies who own our politicians.

“To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.”",0,2024-12-11T04:02:35Z,2024-12-11T04:02:52Z

@nopressurenodiamonds5566,"I feel the frustration as well as many other Americans I see. I lost 50 lbs eating normally and started with a ton of health problems and looked like I was dying. For 2 1/2 years no doctor could figure me out. Finally, they suspected a hidden cancer that was not showing on normal CT scan and I had 3 different doctors order a PET Scan and it was denied every time. This was literally the best test to rule out cancer and could not get the insurance to approve it. After 3 years I have a Lupus diagnosis BUT if it was cancer, that PET Scan could have easily ruled it in or out but insurance could care less. Why do we pay a high monthly premium to still get the test denied that we need! Last week my eyes were so dry I was losing vision on & off, my Opthamoligist prescribed drops to help and you guessed it, DENIED. Really, I could not even get eye drops to help me see?

I’m not a fan of that the fact that this resorted to murder but at the same time, no amount of pleading, go fund me’s, voting, etc has not and will not change the status quo. However, this act has been a wake up call (at the very least, I hope so) to the 99%. If we CAN afford insurance, most cannot afford the additional costs.  I recently had a kidney stone, bill was $1400 at a walk in… insurance covered exactly 0%. As in zero dollars and zero cents. It was a pretty normal thing to deal with, after faithfully paying stupid amounts of money (more than our mortgage) every month for insurance. I received not one penny. We the people, weigh the importance of paying basic bills over going to the doctor and than once we do, insurance covers next to nothing— whatever they feel like (which we find out after the fact, no prices at office) and then fight every step of the way to get approvals to actually get to the bottom of things… should we be so lucky.

@JTSunriseMusic,"### Submission of Evidence: Violations of Luigi Mangione's Constitutional Rights

**Introduction**
This submission presents critical evidence of the gross violations of Luigi Mangione's constitutional rights during his arrest and subsequent treatment by law enforcement officers. The documented actions against Mr. Mangione not only infringe upon his individual rights but also reveal systemic issues within the government's approach to law enforcement.

**Violation of the Right to Free Speech**
On [Date], Mr. Mangione was forcibly prevented from making a public statement to the press. Eyewitness accounts and video footage demonstrate that officers physically restrained Mr. Mangione, thereby silencing him. This act constitutes a blatant violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. The government has no authority to suppress an individual's expression, regardless of the circumstances surrounding their arrest. #FreedomOfSpeech #SilencedVoice 🚨🔇

**Excessive Use of Force**
During his arrest, Mr. Mangione was subjected to excessive physical force, including being slammed against a wall and shackled. This incident is corroborated by multiple witnesses and video evidence. Such actions represent a clear violation of Mr. Mangione's Fourth Amendment rights, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. The excessive use of force by law enforcement is unconstitutional and morally reprehensible. These actions undermine public trust in the justice system and exemplify a disturbing abuse of power. #ExcessiveForce #AbuseOfPower ⚖️💔

**Denial of Due Process**
Mr. Mangione's treatment during his arrest raises significant concerns about the denial of due process. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The manner in which Mr. Mangione was handled suggests a gross disregard for these fundamental protections. Evidence indicates that Mr. Mangione was not informed of his rights and was denied access to legal counsel, further incriminating the government in its failure to uphold the rule of law. #DueProcess #LegalRights 🚔🛑

**Racial Discrimination and Profiling**
Mr. Mangione, an Italian-American with distinct black eyebrows, was subjected to racial profiling and discriminatory treatment. As a minority, he faced undue scrutiny and harsh treatment based on his ethnic background and physical appearance. This racially motivated behavior violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and highlights a deep-seated prejudice within the law enforcement system. #RacialDiscrimination #Profiling 💬✋

**List of Crimes Committed by the Government and Typical Punishments**

- **Excessive Use of Force**: Unlawful physical force used by law enforcement beyond what is necessary. Typical punishments include suspension, termination, and criminal charges.
- **Violation of Free Speech**: Preventing an individual from expressing their views. Typical punishments include civil rights lawsuits and fines.
- **Denial of Due Process**: Failure to provide legal rights and protections during arrest and detention. Typical punishments include civil rights lawsuits and policy reforms.
- **Police Brutality**: Physical violence by police officers. Typical punishments include criminal charges, imprisonment, and termination.
- **Illegal Detention**: Detaining an individual without legal justification. Typical punishments include civil rights lawsuits and fines.
- **Misconduct in Office**: Abuse of power by government officials. Typical punishments include criminal charges, termination, and fines.
- **Corruption**: Bribery, embezzlement, or other forms of corruption. Typical punishments include criminal charges, imprisonment, and fines.
- **Racial Profiling**: Discriminatory targeting of individuals based on race. Typical punishments include civil rights lawsuits and policy reforms.
- **Failure to Train Officers**: Negligence in training law enforcement officers. Typical punishments include civil rights lawsuits and policy reforms.
- **Obstruction of Justice**: Interference with the legal process. Typical punishments include criminal charges, imprisonment, and fines.

**Conclusion**
The treatment of Luigi Mangione is a clear example of constitutional rights violations that demand immediate attention and accountability. These actions are not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of misconduct that must be addressed. The government must take urgent action to investigate these abuses, hold those responsible accountable, and implement measures to prevent such violations in the future.

This submission serves as a call to action for all citizens to demand justice and ensure that the rights guaranteed by our Constitution are upheld for everyone, without exception. #DemandJustice #ConstitutionalRights #Accountability ✊🕊️

The fact that this is happening so fast and they’ve all this information so quickly makes me feel like this poor guy is being totally Framed. And the police have motive absolutely they will make them look like they bust a guy. It would make the Rich not be freaked out and I’m sure they’re all over their butt. And would make the masses not get any ideas because if some dude got away with it then it might inspire more people to do some stuff so it’s in their best interest to bust somebody even a fake person. I don’t think this guy looks like the original guy. They said that they were looking for. They won’t even sure if that was the guy they’re just assuming. So I’m having difficulty trusting that they are being honest because what the bad guy drops his whole bag leaves a bunch of evidence but then keeps the gun? That sounds so fake. I need to see better evidence. I need to see more to work with that. They’re sitting there going oh he wrote bad things about healthcare and CEOs and corporations and so has every American.

never heard any support for

@jenia3031,"The working class is trapped in a brutal cycle of exploitation and disposability. From the moment they enter the workforce, they are forced to accept low wages, poor benefits, and exhausting conditions, all while generating immense profits for the wealthy. Their labor is extracted until their bodies are worn down—often prematurely due to stress, overwork, and inadequate healthcare access.

As they age and become less ""profitable"" to the system, they are discarded. When healthcare is most needed, they are met with claim denials, exorbitant medical bills, and insurance loopholes designed to maximize corporate profits at the cost of human lives. Seniors are left to fend for themselves, dying from treatable conditions because they are deemed too expensive to keep alive.

Meanwhile, their children—the next generation—are funneled into the same exploitative system. From underfunded schools to predatory student loans, young workers are primed to replace their parents in low-wage, high-demand jobs. The cycle ensures a steady stream of labor while keeping families perpetually poor, overworked, and dependent on systems rigged against them.

This is not an accident—it’s by design. Capitalism thrives on this churn, where humans are treated as disposable cogs in a machine that values profit over life. To break this cycle, we must demand a system that prioritizes the well-being of people, not corporations.",0,2024-12-11T02:57:13Z,2024-12-11T02:57:13Z

@crushedmoon1503,"UNITED HEALTH CARE 

Dear Mrs Thompson
 Thank you for your Medical claim for your late husbands emergency treatment for gunshot wounds. Whilst your husband had taken out medical cover for injury and death due to gunshots if you refer to page 647 of the terms and condition booklet it clearly states the policy only covers treatment cost if the gun was fired by a Scottish transsexual between 98 and 99 years old - so unfortunately on this occasion your claim has been denied.
 If your struggling to meet medical expenses we recommend you sell your home and move into a tent. 
 We trust your not in too much distress and thank you for your years of loyalty.

Yours very sincerely indeed.

@robertbasile4289,"Killing the CEO of an insurance company doesn’t change how the health insurance industry operates, nor does it address the systemic issues people are upset about. The person he killed wasn’t the one who created the system, and this act only results in tragedy for his wife and children, who’ve now lost a husband and father. Ironically, that’s the same kind of loss people are angry at insurance companies for causing. If you think this act changes anything beyond who’s sitting in the CEO chair, you’re missing the bigger picture",9,2024-12-11T02:14:27Z,2024-12-11T02:14:27Z
