@darkshadow5581,"Looking back, I really feel the potential of this situation was wasted. Yes, this is celebrity nonsense, but that doesn't mean it's can't be used to further our points.

I don't care about Taylor Swift, but I'm happy, and I loved discussion about her pushing people to vote because it got young people to vote and young people vote Dem.

I feel like as Vaush said, this could been a big win for MeToo, but it just wasn't capitalized on by anyone.",0,2024-04-15T21:04:22Z,2024-04-15T21:04:22Z

@jordanchen23,I disagree with vaush. Amber Heard was definitely weaponizing feminist ideology to her own advantage when she became the representative of the ACLU or whatever. She was trying to use the fabricated abuse narrative to get people to buy into a false public image she's created for herself.,1,2023-08-28T07:39:53Z,2023-08-28T07:39:53Z
@dusty_artichoke,"2:39 - well not everyone knows about men being abused: I come from eastern European country and the idea of man being abused by woman or his wife is kinda foreign here, or even laughed at (like sexual harassment on a man). i know one woman who was working as a social worker in shelters for women experiencing violence at home, and she came into contact with many men who suffered violence, had deformed faces, bloody scars on body etc. who weren't able to protect themselves from violence, or couldn't and she said she was honestly surprised by that - and that's the ""good"" case because she at least now beliefs in something like that (although sometimes scoffs that ""we need to protect also the weak men""....), but she had to see it with her own eyes (and still don't understand it 100%). Many more just plainly disbelief it, make fun of it, or think about those men as weak etc.",2,2023-05-19T16:45:25Z,2023-05-19T16:45:25Z

@GiltleyRage,"Sorry, but people need to be reminded that men can be abuse victims. And these are the same people who think that Depp winning is a step back for all women like we're in some fucking gender war. Yeah, this trial was a joke, a clash of Hollywood priviliged spoiled brats, but it was also an important one. Because of cases like this, people will realize that abuse don't have any gender. Women are gaining more power which is great thing, but as they're as human as men (shocking for some people, I know), we will also see them abusing their power more often. We need to learn to recognize it, name it and punish it with the same severity.

@RealmRabbit,"Well, the case might not actually be done... Amber Heard and her lawyers seem to want an appeal in which case the show shall go on... Assuming Amber can afford it anyway, I think her lawyer said she maybe can't afford to pay the millions she owes Johnny Depp so perhaps that won't really be happening... Especially since I don't think she is going to be in Aquaman 2 since she defamed Johnny Depp...

There's some people who are like ""This trial is bad for women!"" but no, if you watched the trial you would've seen that Camille Vasquez was had a pretty inspirational role in it... The trial itself wasn't bad for women, Amber Heard is bad for women...

And honestly if you haven't watched the trial and you don't understand why people were discussing it so much, maybe there's a lot to the trial that you don't know about because you didn't watch it... A lot of these so-called 'experts' Amber brought in were comically insulting to the intelligence of even the average person which is a really low bar...",0,2022-06-12T14:08:17Z,2022-06-12T14:15:37Z

@RipIPDime,"""This was bad PR for MeToo"" is not contradictory to ""This was good for male victims"". It WAS a step forward for male victims, if only as a demonstration to them that their abuse was real. But the MeToo movement has not played out as a movement focusing on abuse of men. The MeToo movement, predominately, has focused on the female victims of abuse, and specifically on how society fails to take women's allegations seriously. Like it or not, true to reality or not, the MeToo movement has been associated with extreme slogans like ""Believe all Women"" (like how CRT was associated with ""everything bad""), so when society gets burned, bad and publicly, by a lying woman who not only lied about her alleged abuse but WAS the abuser.. people remember ""Believe all Women"" and their brains blame MeToo. Not that they should, but that's what people will see.

This whole spectacle made clear some lessons that we have the opportunity to learn from about abuse, narcissism, and gender bias. But those lessons don't inherently sink in. If we fail to internalize the right message, which should be some more nuanced version of ""Trust but Verify"" (more along the lines of ""earnestly investigate all allegations""), then it's for sure possible that society backlashes and becomes more skeptical of abuse victims who can't produce evidence like a millionaire celebrity can. IMO, this whole situation has the potential to be a disaster for women, but people who are blaming JD, the courts, the lawyers, the jury, etc.. are off base. Amber Heard gave Right Wing screechers exactly what they wanted, which was an abuser who tricked the public for years and a situation where the record was only corrected with an egregious amount of money. They want to point out that this correction of the record would have been impossible for a normal person, because they're right. Amber Heard is such a potent piece of propaganda because they can point to some element of truth in the threat her type of lying can pose.",2,2022-06-04T17:58:30Z,2022-06-04T17:58:30Z

From what I've seen of the case there is no evidence of the abuse Heard said she endured, while Depp has actual evidence of abuse against him, the most infamous being the recording of Heard admitting she hit him and calling him a baby for walking away from fights.

They're both deeply weird people and, beyond the obvious caveat that domestic abuse is bad, I couldn't care less who hit who.

@bitzangubbinzondaleft,"Guys maybe I'm a bad man but I find this really sad. 
I watched the trial and there is so much backlash from our side too. I'm sorry but I feel slightly ill that our side just handwaves away when we are confronted with men being abused. Those people that do are participating in the patriarichal BS that we are fighting against for equality. Sad to say my lovely lefties, but femenism is also accepting that women can abuse too. Women are people too, not some mystical elven sylphs who can't do wrong. They are human beings, who can have flaws and weaknesses.

This ""Orgy of mysogeny"" and other articles I've seen are just aweful. With so many it's apperrant they haven't seen it or ignore some key points. Like how Amber's bruises disappeared a day after without any swelling. Now I've been in plenty of fights and trust me, swelling in the face doesn't go down in under 24 hours. The fact that none of Johnny's former partners were ever abused is alos an indicator. An abuser has a history of being an abuser. Amber though, has. 

What was the ""biggest"" evidence Amber had when it came to Johnny's abuse? two pictures she stated were seperate times, yet I bet someone who doesn't have a backround in photoshop could see it was the same picture but with the stauration upped. (strangely no swelling yet again) and a vid of him being angry, slamming some kitchen doors, while swearing; ow and a text message that he was going to kill her. Yeah because we haven't EVER vented about our partners to our friends (a partner where there is alot more evidence of abuse). While on Johnny's side? multiple witness statements, where Amber's statements did not corroborate with theirs. An audio where she litterally emotionally abused Johnny. Audio where she is gasslighting him (yah know what an abuser does?) etc etc etc... 

Yes I accept I partook in the ghoulish behaviour. But to those who haven't seen it (which is many on our side) you haven't seen it. You can't know and for some reason it's almost borderline sexist how people react. Plus I have to admit it was entertaining seeing Amber dig herself into a deeper and deeper hole. Like how she continued the lie that Johnny threw Kate Moss off the stairs. where Kate could go on the record and say that that is a tabloyd lie. If anything it showed how Johnny really was and who Johnny was. Even Amber spoke very highly of him during the case. which is odd when tallking about an abuser. Maybe stockholm? but if he was such an abbusive shit it would've gone vastly different in this case because there would be ALOT more evidence. It was entertaining to see how the truth came to light and how bad Amber was as an actress.

I love Vaush, he's a gud boi and I agree on many facets with him. But hoooly moly Jezuschrist on a bloody moped. This was just shit. Fine if you haven't seen it that's OK you don't have to. Either give your oppinion why you didn't (or shouldn't) watch this. 
But to be part of the patriarichal BS by handwaving abuse away; and then also complain about men killing themselves by the boatload is just aweful. I thought we were  all femenists and wanted equal treatment of the sexes? Heck didn't our boi want to abolish that all together?

We can't prevent dickheads from pointing to this and scream: ""Shee?!? Wahmen are all liars! mee twoo is just wahmen twying to get un ovah uz"". We can however, point to plenty of legitimate cases of Me Too. Plus this case isn't part of mee too, it's a defemation trial between two celebrities. If we close ranks and hold strong nothing that idiots like Steven Chowderhead or Ben Sadpirro say could hurt Me Too.",2,2022-06-04T11:33:15Z,2022-06-04T11:33:15Z

Then the whole ""listen and believe women"" and ""believe women"" misrepresentation where it does not say anything about ""taking them seriously"" and literally talks about accepting women's (explicitly not men's) allegations of sexual harassment or sexual assault at face value even in the absence of evidence!

I generally don’t like the switch the roles argument but looking at a public case of an actor physically abusing an actress and saying “I refuse to look into the allegations because this is celebrity culture but let me talk about how both of these people are bad and their wealth cancels out this abuse.” would be incredibly cringe. Just say you haven’t really followed the case and that abuse is bad.",4,2022-06-04T00:25:21Z,2022-06-04T00:25:21Z

@justwaves1,"I don't really appreciate Vaush saying ""I don't know anything about x"" when talking on topics. Obviously he shouldn't lie that he knows things, and I don't expect him to be an expert on all the details of every topic, but when he makes claims about something to thousands of viewers, doing 10 minutes of research first seems like solid practice. I don't think it would necessarily change his perspective, but having to couch his position on not knowing things many people know in detail seems unproductive.

I also think he was more willing to do this in this case, because the victim was a man, whether he realizes it or not (and whether it's simply the optics of such a situation, or not). I can't imagine him covering, say, Kavanaugh, and saying something like ""well, maybe he sexually assaulted these women or not, I didn't read about the testimony, but either way...."" leading into a different point. As a viewer, I want to challenge and improve my perspectives from these videos, but I think bringing the material facts of whatever situation is being discussed to the table is a key part of that. I do think people are over-involved with this trial, but I think much of the chat reaction would happen if most of chat was similarly aware of the ""facts"" of whatever situation that Vaush wasn't. I fall into the camp of not knowing much about the trial, so I think a relevant and relatively ""to the facts"" summary would have been helpful for us both.",1,2022-06-03T23:43:28Z,2022-06-03T23:43:28Z
@j_lemy,"Vaush, I love you, but dude, you did say you believe there was ""mutual abuse"". There's zero proof for any abuse coming from Johnny's side.

@ryanbarnes840,"So what? Johnny was falsely accused, and that's a big deal in this day and age where social media is where trials are held. Depp was crucified and fired from major film projects over these lies, and it turns out she was the abuser? Yeah, I take an interest in that because the ""believe all women"" BS that the Me Too movement has created is not healthy. It's important to take any accusation seriously, but at the same time it's also important to understand that people can lie, and this case proves that perfectly. I think it was a necessary wake up call to the people out there who think any time a woman says a man hurt her, or did something to her, that we need to only hear her side of the story and ruin the career of the man.",2,2022-06-03T23:28:21Z,2022-06-03T23:28:21Z

@danceswithdisaster2575,"Honestly, I feel this whole video so much. 

This whole thing has been a shit storm, overly-politicized from the beginning. I get they're celebrities, but everyone seems to be forgetting that they're also real people, and at least one of them was seriously hurt during this thing. It should never have been televised either, but I get why it needed to be because after its over-politicization, the whole reason this specific trial even exists was to repair Depp's reputation and hopefully set the record straight which needed to be done publicly because the whole thing was public from the beginning. 

But there are channels monetizing their coverage of it. And I mean cutting away during their coverage of it to do sponsored ads, and it's frankly pretty disgusting. Everything surrounding this has been a plague. 

There are people talking about how she supposedly cheated, and he did drugs, and it's like, who the fuck cares? Someone unjustly hit someone. No amount of cheating or drugs justifies it. If you're not happy in a relationship, fucking leave and don't become abusive?

Seriously, cancer.

I have never seen a case where the forensic psychologists juxtaposed each other so extremely in their statements, and the evidence provided with Heard's testimony was so incredibly obscure. Like with the cocaine, she just randomly showed a table with cocaine with no one in the photo, and was like this is proof that Johnny has a cocaine addiction when it could have just as easily been her cocaine, or NEITHER or theirs? Her evidence of abuse were photos of her face broken out, which appeared to be from acne or crying, comparing these to her testimony of her nose being broken and having black eyes. It was just the strangest experience, and I wasn't sure that any of the evidence provided actually was evidence that should have been presented, and the expert witnesses were wild.

I don't care about either actor. But like in the other trials, I saw and watched this as a learning experience about how are criminal justice system works. Trials are something that are rarely even remotely portrayed accurately in fiction. After watching one of those expect reacts to trial in courts kind of thing, I was stunned how little I understood about how trials proceed. How Direct and Cross-examination are actually done,etc. And because it was popular, like the former trials I mentioned. It makes sense to watch it, as lots of channels on YT are commenting on it. So it makes it even more interesting. For example, David Pakman streamed all 4 trials I mention at different times.

@CAVFIFTEEN,"Some good points here especially at the end. But I am generally disappointed in how out of touch and tone-deaf Vaush was on this one. I like the guy's content a lot. He helped me move from center to more left leaning and has helped me become more engaged in politics etc. 

This take on feminism and metoo being for men as well and ""believe all women"" not literally meaning what it says is just insane to me. While all of these points are all true and these movemnts/slogans were made with and represent good intentions, they have in fact been weaponized by extremists on both sides to hurt others. Because of this, I always thought ""believe all women"" was a terrible slogan anyway. It should be ""listen to victims"" or something of that nature. Nothing so matter of fact like the current phrase. When people hear things like that or ""defund the police"" it unfortunately doesn't matter what the slogan is actually trying to get at or the nuance of it all. 

The general public take things at face value and if we want to actually make the world a better place, we need our movements,slogans, etc. to have as little room for incorrect interpretation and be as specific as possible. Instead of ""defund the police"" why not ""de-militarize the police"" or ""re-allocate funds from the police to social programs"". Instead of ""feminism"" why not just push for ""Egalitarianism"" ? So many people hear things like the current phrases and either want nothing to do with it because they think it doesn't benefit them as well, or they're completely against it because they think it's an attack on them. We need to do better with this stuff. These are the kind of things that pushed a lot of people right back in the gamer gate days. The way we deliver our messages is just as important as what our messages are.

Although metoo SHOULD be for all people regardless of gender and ""believe all women"" SHOULD mean to listen to and understand what they mean rather than outright dismissing them, that isn't the reality of what they've become. That's why this win is so important for positive social change and it's good that it's encouraging men to speak up about being victims of abuse and things in the like. These are the normie things that matter and get people's attention. Whether they SHOULD be important or not, they are. And the amount of women I've seen online defending Johnny and men in general, while also clapping back at Amber for using their movement as a weapon is astounding. Maybe now we can finally see a true balance and equality of genders when it comes to these issues. Obviously we can't let the right run with it the other way either, but this is a win for everybody. Whether or not it SHOULD have taken this for people to pay attention is irrelevant. It did. And that's what matters.",4,2022-06-03T15:14:35Z,2022-06-03T15:14:35Z

@samclemens6613,"2 things:
Genuine question, why do we still hate Anita Sarkeesian in 2022? I get that she’s kind of annoying, or at least that’s how I remember feeling when I saw her stuff around Gamergate, but I don’t feel like I remember seeing any crazy hot takes- the one I remember the best was her video talking about how the damsel in distress trope is really dumb and overplayed. Is she a grifter or terf or something?

Additionally I get that Vaush is deathly allergic to engaging in celebrity culture (me too), but having seen just a bit of footage and hearing about the stuff going on around the trial, I feel like it’s fairly obvious that Amber was the victim of SEVERE abuse and anything she ended up doing to Depp was retaliatory after years of putting up with it. Additionally I don’t feel like he went hard enough on the Depp stans because holy shit is it all just rampant misogyny, not one of them actually gives an f about the case they just saw a woman they were told was bad and now they have an outlet to spread their woman hating through. If he wasn’t interested in the trial and didn’t know a whole lot I wish he would’ve just kept quiet about it.",0,2022-06-03T14:59:46Z,2022-06-03T14:59:46Z

@collateraldamage7172,"Seriously now.. Every single time i say something about male victims of abuse i get gaslighted or downvoted. Not from right leaning or traditional people, mind you. On one hand you say men should open up or else it's ""toxic masculinity"", on the other hand, when we actually do people (who are willing to respond at all) on the left and in feminist circles act like 5 year olds who think we are trying to take away their lollypop. You talk about your abuse or about abuse in general on right leaning, traditional or MRA forums, you do not get ridiculed dude. You get support, and of course they will crap on feminism and on lefties, but that's because they have similar experiences, as in: no one (on those left leaning forums) is willing to listen or to have a genuine conversation, getting triggered by facts rather, no matter how respectful and courteous you are. Go ahead and try it for yourself, you'll be lucky if you don't get banned right away. Then you go ahead and pretend like you do not understand where all the ""hate"" is coming from on the right... It's not the initial goals of metoo or even feminism we do not aggree with, much rather it's the political weapon they became. The problem with metoo and beleive women is that it focuses all attention on female victims and gives the impression to people that it's ok to generalize against men and that it sees the solution to the problem in ""fixing men"" or abolishing the patriarchy (f.e.: Duluth model) when in fact men are only part of the problem, not THE problem and patriarchy is virtually non existent.

@The_Story_Of_Us,"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this case itself. Amber Heard did lie a lot and make defamatory statements and she was punished for it in a court of law. That’s good.

What isn’t good is the public response to this goddamn thing. Heard is recieving the overwhelming brunt of hate for this, you know she’s probably received more death threats than anyone in the country and I don’t give a fuck what she’s done, she doesn’t deserve that. Like congratulations, she’s already living in hell before she went broke in the courtroom, hope you’re happy. 

What people don’t also recognize is that there was 100% mutual abuse in this relationship and people who can’t see that have the mental age of a 10 year old. Whether it was 70/30, 80/20, whatever, I don’t care. But Johnny is being treated like a precious innocent little puppy and it’s sickening…

Because women are not held to that standard. They must be “perfect victims”. Unless they are 100% in the right, they will be vehemently assaulted by the public. I’m not declaring any innocence on Heard’s part, but PROPORTIO-FUCKING-NALITY, GODDAMN! Like seriously, you have politicians RAPING YOU every second of every day, millions of people, and THIS CHICK saying some bs about THIS DUDE is the real public enemy #1???

At any rate, the real problem here is that is an unfortunate situation that incels, hogs, every fucking alt right lunatic is going to spin into an attack on feminism and women’s rights. Amber Heard is not a feminist spearhead, she’s a selfish shitbird who just offers up free ammo to the enemy.

@pickyourswitchoriginal,"You can ""true trial"". This is the first time a trial of this stature has been livestreamed from start to finish. And lawtubers have been providing legal education and commentary along the way. This was messy, but ultimately about justice, NOT celebrity. Had these two been regular Joe/Jane they wouldn't have received the trial livestream.

THAT'S why the social media uber interest...celebrity is icing, NOT the ultimate draw. So many watched who weren't fans of either. What's frustrating is commenters and media trying to carve out their piece of the popular pie as johnny-come-lately or social media making comments from only watching sound bites or editorial commentary without having sufficient information. 

As a DV survivor and someone who watched the actual trial AH is the LAST person I want representing me...she's an extremely disturbed individual. JD could absolutely represent me. AH reminded me of my narcissistic abuser.

This was about defamation (and solely regarding Depp v Heard), yes, but underlying was ultimately about justice, not ""male"" or ""female"", but victim vs abuser. Those who followed the trial knew undoubtedly which party was which.",8,2022-06-03T11:35:05Z,2022-06-03T11:43:25Z

@zacg_,"I don't like the phrase ""believe all women"" because it invites this kind of pedantry. I don't think anyone who used that phrase meant ""believe everything any woman says regardless of the context."" That said, from what I've observed there are some people who view it as ""believe all women when they allege abuse."" I think most people view it as ""take women's abuse accusations seriously"" but I've observed some people viewing it as we ought to actively believe the accusations unless there is proof otherwise. That's a bad take and it's why this is a bad phrase.

It reminds me of ""defund the police."" The phrase is bad because it invites misunderstanding. But there are people who are literal about that and believe the existence of police should be ended. So it creates a situation where conservatives can dismiss the entire movement behind it and they have people to point to as clear evidence that the phrase is literal and this leaves most people with a bad impression about the movement itself.

@robertbaur837,"Lol it is a court case but one of the most hilarious cases she was such an obvious liar and a narcissist   and actually no vaush he is not me tooing her because he never pressed charges against her for DV and never claimed to be a victim until she accused him falsely of abusing her.  The moral is and always was the importance of due process sigh Johnny WAS falsely accused of abuse and it did affect his career. Saying this is a neutral is plain wrong because he sued for defamation not damages or injuries. It's a blow against making false accusations.  I don't see why you heavily align the me too movement with the right of people to make false accusations thus admitting it's detractors have a point. The critics of me too never were against making legitimate claims of DV or sexual abuse when they exist only that such claims automatically be believed without evidence you seem to struggle with this.   This case was not as much about Johnny being abused it's about clearing his reputation his being abused is just more evidence how ridiculous he was accused in the first place. Believe all women doesn't mean believe all women.. . Ok.. well lol One depp IS a man two why believe ALL anyone women or men as some people LIE as amber a woman IS and did.

@MistaCatsby,"This is really disappointing, it seems no one on the left has actually watched much of the trial. People looking to hear more will end up hearing from the right that the left doesn't care about male survivors and thinks if a woman accuses you of a crime, she's always right. Having no response to this makes us look weak and dishonest, like all of our ""men are also hurt by the patriarchy and their needs are included in feminism"" points look like a bunch of virtue signaling. Just because the right is pleased with this outcome doesn't mean the outcome is bad, only that they find it easy to spin, especially with the left being quiet or ""well fuck rich people, mutual abuse, this isn't worth discussing."" Vaush of all people should be here to give an egalitarian reaction that talks about why gender essentialism hurts everyone. (As a trans person it also eerie how similar Amber Heard and her team's rhetoric is like TERF points. Woman = victim, man = monster because is man). I think this is really missing about opportunity to show the left is reasonable and our positions are accessible and make sense. Damn, has anyone on the left even tried to have a good, informed take on this MASSIVE public spectacle?",5,2022-06-03T10:00:33Z,2022-06-03T10:00:33Z
@StargazerSkyscraper,"What really bothered me about this case, and a bunch of other similar controversies in the recent past, is how the fairweather bigots came out of the fucking woodwork. I'm not talking about the people who were posting stuff like ""Amber Heard's abusive, fuck her!"" because that's an understandable statement and it's okay to expressed anger toward another person's actions (or alleged actions).

What turned me off following the case entirely were the posts about Amber Heard being ugly, fat, uncultured, pasty, talentless, a hack, a fake, a wannabe, an addict, slutty, diseased, etc. I've seen the same shit done to other public figures as well, the moment the public decides their mistakes, poorly-worded tweets, problematic past, etc. revokes that person's right to basic humanity. It's disgusting. 

Yet when this is pointed out, it's always ""Well, they did XYZ so whatever, I can say whatever I want about them, they're a public figure so boohoo, you're defending them, how dare you, lol go cry for famous people somewhere else,"" etc. They can't admit to themselves for a moment that maybe, just maybe, the problem is that they're making *other* people, their own friends, feel unsafe around them, because they're demonstrating how two-faced they really are when it comes to these things. 

It's the same feeling I get when a transperson gets caught up in controversy or does something inexcusable. Suddenly everyone who was championing trans rights the day before decides it's okay to misgender and deadname this transperson, because they're a bad transperson who doesn't deserve rights, or they were never a ""real trans"", ""our community doesn't claim them haha sorryyyyy"" etc. 

I'll buy that justification when those same people start misgendering and throwing slurs around when they talk about Jeffery Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy. Why do literal serial killers and pedos get more consideration and respect from true-crime fans than some random out-of-touch celeb who committed a micro-aggression last week?

*TL;DR:* Either your beliefs mean something or they don't; you can't have it both ways. You can't say it's wrong to tear down people for their looks, their mental health, their sexuality, etc. and then do that *exact same thing* just because a celebrity you don't like exists, or because the person in question happens to be a criminal. You also can't run your mouth like that and then wonder why other women, transpeople, minorities, etc. suddenly don't feel as safe around you as before.

I wish more people had the nerve to point this hypocrisy out tbh. It happens all the time, and nobody says anything, I guess because they're afraid they'll be seen as defending the indefensible, or protecting baddies. It's not about that shit. It's about consistency between what you preach and what you practice. Is it really that fucking hard for some people to fathom?",1,2022-06-03T10:00:24Z,2022-06-03T12:01:34Z

@StubbeA,"Vaush, it's really disappointing how inconsistent you're being on this issue. On the one hand, you claim to know nothing about the trial and are just weirded out by the discourse. On the other hand, you seem to uncritically accept the pro-Depp framing where Heard is abusive (or the ""mutual abuse"" rhetoric) and go from there. I agree that ""believe women"" shouldn't be doctrinaire - it's supposed to be about how domestic violence is much more commonplace than most people like to believe. In this case, Amber Heard's story is not only credibly backed up by evidence even from before the two of them got married, it also fits a pattern that's recognizable and believable on its face. Depp's case amounts to a conspiracy theory.

If we truly want to be allies to women, to victims of domestic violence, we need to stand up for them even when public sentiment is against them. Especially then, in fact. I hope you learn more about this case and realize this in the future.",2,2022-06-03T09:48:30Z,2022-06-03T09:48:30Z

@jonoxes8662,"No I think you're wrong Vaush. A large part of the people who hate Amber Heard are people who just want equality for men in this abuse case. In this one instance it actually is the case. Because she's on record admitting that she abused him, and mocking him, calling him a ""pussy"" and a ""baby"" for complaining about her beating him.

That's why this case matters a lot to people, because if she could get away with that, when that's publically available. If Amber had won the case then it would solidify that, when it comes to abuse, men are truly without help. They can be beaten and no one will care, all while the woman accuses them of being the abuser. Even if that's not what the court case was officially about, to the public that's what it became imo.

That would be the most anti-feminist, anti-equality outcome, and it would legitimize anti-women and MRA sentiment to no end. Politically, the consequences of people defending Amber Heard will be bad enough. If she'd have won it would be 10x worse.",5,2022-06-03T09:01:26Z,2022-06-03T09:01:26Z

Getting personal here but me too for me almost pushed me further right because of people like Anita. As a cis man if I talked about abuse I faced I got disbelief from the people championing me too but the ""center rights"" believed. we definitely need more people like vaush on the left who when they say it's for everyone it's for everyone. The radical feminist sexism feeds the right. And to be clear I do not think feminism itself is sexist but the radicals are. 

The people that assume she must be right and he must be the abuser because gender feeds into the conservatives saying the opposite.

Still, you are seriously simplifying significant aspects of the case and playing it off to be a mocking jester or joking about it. But if you actually didn't care about it then you could have said nothing about it and then hardly anyone would care. But don't oversimplify a case like this as ""oh well this means that men can be abused too"" when in reality, and to be frank I find your laziness to dive deeper into the case to be quite condescending and fucking idiotic, it was about a man that was not only being physically anused by Amber Heard but having the entire story be flipped to make it appear that she was the one being abused physically in the relationship and going public with it. There was no evidence presented by Heard's team presented in court that would suggest her story to be true. Only a few photos she took that appear to be tampered with, as Depp's lawyer made clear during the trial. Either way, I find your lack of knowledge on the case to be completely obscured considering you're going to make a thirty-minute video about this case just ranting about it but making sure you get ""Johnny Depp"" in the title to farm for views. I used to be a big supporter of yours because you made really good arguments and had the audacity to debate conservatives and arranged ""leftists"" but now I see that you are only looking to get attention for your channel and I find it disgusting at this point.

@colinvollmer,"What gets me about this case is that _Depp was suing Heard,_ not the other way around. Depp was claiming that Heard defamed him when she insinuated in that WaPo article that he had abused her. Now, she did countersue, saying that one of Depp’s lawyers had defamed _her_ by claiming her accusations were a hoax. But one possible defense to defamation is truth, so if Heard could present evidence that Depp had abused her even once, that would be enough to avoid defamation. (At least, this is how I understand defamation law to work.) 

All of this to say: legally speaking, it doesn’t matter if Heard also abused Depp at some point. Of course it matters practically, but this isn’t a case about comparative fault. You can’t claim defamation by saying “but she abused me too!” Depp had to argue that what Heard said was knowingly false, so to me all the evidence they brought up about Heard’s potential abuse was a red herring. It’s an effective legal strategy, to poison the well for the jury so they develop a dislike of Heard, but it’s not legally relevant to what Depp himself did. 

Two other things stand out. One, the main argument from Depp was that Heard made this whole thing up. It was a complete hoax, everything she said were a series of malicious lies just to hurt Depp’s career. _But the jury found in favor of Heard when they said Depp’s lawyer had defamed her by calling it a hoax!_ So on the one hand, the jury says “Yes Mr. Depp, we believe you that Heard wasn’t telling the truth and knew she wasn’t, so we’ll find in favor of your defamation claims.” But at the same time, the jury says “Yes Ms. Heard, we agree that Depp’s lawyer defamed you by calling this a hoax.” Which is it???

Second thing: the jury wasn’t sequestered. This is rare, at least as far as I’m aware, _particularly_ in such a high profile case. That means the jury was aware of all the media coverage, the partisan spinning, and the entire apparatus that sprung up around Depp and accused Heard of all kinds of insane shit.

@cobrakaier238,"Many leftists sided with Amber Heard without paying any attention to the case and called everyone siding with Depp a mysoginist, who hates her for no reason and a dumb fanboy. The only informed take I have seen on the issue is by Ana Kasparian. Liberal media is siding with Heard despite all the evidence against her, conveniently they never mention it. I expected the right will pretend it is some kind of a win for them but I don't care what they have to say, I look up to left-wing content creators and most of them had a badly-informed take because they didn't bother to follow the case.

@jeremymr,"I think this trial was important because someone being falsely accused of horrible crimes by their abuser and having it ruin their career for years is not acceptable and not something we should be OK with normalizing. Not only did Amber’s lies harm Johnny, they harmed his kids. Because he’s a celebrity, Amber’s lies were able to spread fast and wide. So he needed a public trial to be able to make his case for clearing his name. And if Vaush watched the trial, he’d find out Johnny isn't perfect but he isn’t some shallow celebrity that flaunts his wealth. He let so many people live at his place for free and did so much for charity without talking about it. Hes really introverted and repeatedly said he didn’t want this to have to go to trial and he hates all this crazy drama and media circus. Usually in cases like this I don't like taking a side because there's not much solid evidence either way and the court of public opinion isn't always right. I kind of don't like public trials, as interesting as they are and as much as I enjoy the memes, because they tend to cause too many death threats and things like people spamming the businesses of witnesses with one-star reviews and shit like that. Unfortunately, that's happened a lot in this trial. But in this case there is plenty of solid evidence that Amber's allegations against Johnny were malicious lies so I think the public trial was necessary. For years, Amber was allowed to spread horrible lies that hurt Johnny's career without much consequence. But now she's been exposed and the entire trial is there for anyone to see. I thought the fact that she claimed to be scared for her life yet in same time period was cheating on Johnny with multiple people in his penthouse was a particularly damning piece of evidence... Also the photos of her at events that contradict her claims of being beat up and testimonies of witnesses like Dr. Shannon Curry... Multiple instances of her changing her story and gaslighting... The fact that she's recorded on tape admitting she hit Johnny... And there's a recording of her saying that if Johnny went public saying he was a victim of domestic violence no one would believe him because he's a man and he would lose in court... The cosmetic company Milani stated the specific makeup Amber claimed she used to cover up her bruises didn't exist at the time she claimed she used it... Also, the fact that she never sought medical attention, even for allegedly serious injuries... And her fake crying in court (I've never seen someone sob so much without shedding a tear). It must have been traumatic for Johnny to go through this, and if you noticed he didn't look at Amber and was drawing during a lot of the trial because it's often traumatic for victims of abuse to even see their victims. But he went through this thing with grace and dignity, while openly admitting his own faults, and I have more respect for him than ever because of that.",3,2022-06-03T05:30:44Z,2022-06-03T05:30:44Z

@neildepressedtyson540,"I think one of the most depressing things about this case is that as a man who has been assaulted by women and sisters/relatives/girlfriends before, the pain I feel for Amber Heard in this case is truly unbelievable.

I think this loss, while obvious in a heavily fundamentally sexist system, is symbolic of the struggle women face as a class, and what we have to overcome if we are to reduce the disparities in violence between the genders. 

I know people are saying that she's ruined the MeToo movement or feminism or some other nonsense, but actually you guys saying that is what's ruining it. Now when a woman is bashed and raped by a powerful man, she knows she has to come with so much invasive, televised proof and evidence, and to pay big time to litigate it that it will just get swept under the rug, and men know this, that's why we're seeing this massive show of force to silence her, humiliate her, make endless content and memes about her, all painting Johnny as the Soothsaying Renegade and her as the emotional bed-shitting psychopath who mutilates fingers for fun and works for the mexican cartels doing beheadings.",7,2022-06-03T04:46:12Z,2022-06-03T04:46:12Z

If Amber Heard had won, it would have terrible cultural consequences. It would be a disaster for feminism. If Johnny Depp had lost, right-wingers would weaponize it (wrongly and stupidly) against feminism and leftism...

Vaush, I'm a long time fan, hard-lefr, and always will be. This hurts. I always thought of you as one of the most honest content creators out there.

I don't believe you are being honest or good faith with your takes here. This in fact is dismissive to victims of abuse.

Imagine the shoe was in the other foot and it was PROVEN that Johnny had lobbed off a piece of Amber's finger. Imagine there being a video of Johnny saying ""I didn't punch you - I just hit you - you're such a baby"". Imagine that it was PROVEN that Johnny hit not just amber but his exes, abused his staff and was a general POS to all his friends and his family and Amber's family. Imagine that Johnny then pledges 7 million divorce settlement to the ACLU and the Children's Hospital of LA and not pay even a half million yet CLAIM in national TV he has DONATED said money.

To THEN claim to be a victim of the most heinous SA (watch Gone-girl) and DA for the purpose cancelling Amber and all of this is proven not just false but MALICIOUS. 

Imagine that after all that (and MUCH more), Johnny then claims to be a Public Figure representing people who speak out against SV.

Would you dismiss this then as ""just some Hollywood soap opera""?

Honestly man, I love you but you are dead wrong here and you are harming the left.

Keep in mind this trial was watched by millions and on all streams I watched about 98% of said watchers agreed with the fact that Johnny ought to have won

Please try to engage with Emily Baker, CLR,  Legal Bytes, lawyer you know or someone else from law tube PLEASE. 

Right now you just seem willfully ignorant (or dishonest). But worse of all, dismissive to victims of abuse and an enabler of an abuser. This isn't an issue you can just weasel yourself into a ""blissfully ignorant neutral"" this trial is monumentally important. And you should stand against all abusers and for all victims of abuse

 Anyone who watched with good ears and half a brain clearly saw the disgusting abuse Johnny was submitted to and the painful exploitation of the me too movement by a very violent gaslighter (who I'm 99% sure is a closet republican)

@DevinMacGregor,"I am far on the Left but the Left does lack a lot of self awareness of how slogans on its side are abused by people on its side.

I am saying this over a comment below of it was believe women not believe all women. This is such shallow thought because the all is implied. It does not have to be explicitly written.  If women in the past or even present are not taken seriously in their accusations then it should not be believe women but take women more seriously. It is also why we get Not All Men thrown back at us because when we say Men do this and Men do that, the all is implied. Some is not. We accuse the Right of doing this all the time when it says immigrant this or black this or black that or any minority group. We accuse them of making a demographic a monolith with no nuance while we act like our side has such great nuance of its own slogans etc. 

The UK case was against the SUN to which Depp did not get to state his side.  In the US case he sued her and it was about him being able to tell his side of it.

Words have meanings and it is important to select the correct words such as Defund the Police when defund means take away funding so that a program can no longer function. Just a year before that the Left was using that same word in its proper context when Trump defunded and thus ended our world pandemic team. Demilitarize the Police would have been a much better slogan as it hits the heart of the matter. I understand what Black Lives Matters is meaning, that black lives should not be devalued. The heart of the matter is Police Brutality matters.  So, Police Brutality Matters. Or with Medicare for All.  I know what the plan contains but it fails optics as well because it is implying that the current medicare, which sucks and is not all comprehensive, is going to be the plan for all when it should be MedicarePlus or Medicare+. That implies it is more than just the current Medicare. Our response should not be, well these d*******s should learn to read.

Like I said, words matter and this is why the Politician Right did not say ACA but said Obamacare to which millions on the Public Right literally had no idea they both were the same. In some cases they openly praised ACA as a lifesaver for their family while emotionally wanting to destroy Obamacare as an evil and vile thing.

I am not saying the Left should go Orwellian but be more aware that words do matter.  Many keep saying Feminism is about Equality but that is like saying the US is about Freedom and Justice.  Or those on the Right who keep expanding the scope of what Capitalism is or Free Market as if free means everyone has more freedom. For the most part Feminism is about breaking down barriers for women, ie the vote, being able to own property and create bank accounts, being able to enter fields that previously only men could be in, being able to own businesses, gendered roles that hinder women, etc etc. Note that last one. My Mom is a 2nd wave feminist and still holds onto those beliefs. It is less so now but I have moved away from those types of group discussions because they were disappointing but you would see a lot of, well men should form their own movement.",0,2022-06-03T03:51:02Z,2022-06-03T03:51:02Z

@stephaniel2850,"** Super long venting session ahead, sorry ! it's just been something I've been so disappointed by over the last few days** 

While I absolutely agree with everyone calling out the media circus and memeification of what was a very serious domestic abuse case, quite honestly, what's been the most upsetting to me in recent days is the amount of genuinely well-meaning leftists I've seen jumping right on the abuse apologetics for Amber. And to a degree, I do get it - if you have no interest in the details of the case, the circus around it looks like nothing but a whoooole mess of internet vitriol and misogyny, because there IS a ton of that, it's true, and it's awful! 

But interpersonal relationships are not society. Systemic misogyny existing *does not* mean that an individual woman can't be abusive to an individual man and make false allegations to continue abusing him. And you're really not going to get more clear than the absolute mountain of evidence proving Amber's deliberately horrific and severe allegations false. 99% of people in general would never lie about being abused, but 99% is not zero. And leftist feminists NEED to wake up and be willing to deal with that. It's the worst feeling, having to question the credibility and motives of someone sitting there saying they've been through such horrific trauma. But the truth is the truth, and there is no excuse for using the name of feminism to protect an abusive woman who was low enough to appropriate the extreme abuse others have had to suffer to make her ex-husband look as monstrous as possible. 


This case could have been such an opportunity to have a strong feminist-led discussion about the ways in which men are also harmed by the patriarchy, and how best we can hold abusive women accountable while continuing to fight back against reactionary misogyny and extending the same degree of support and solidarity Johnny has received to women and ALL survivors going forward. These are important, necessary conversations. And instead, I've just seen so many well-meaning people passionately defending an abuser because they're not willing to look at the details beyond the fact that she's a woman, and I feel deeply gaslit 😔

I know this is already a super long ramble, but just to drive the point home, here's a quote from Amber to Johnny, captured pretty much verbatim from direct audio recordings:

""I'm sorry that I wasn't hitting you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, I was not punching you. Babe, you were not punched ... You didn't get punched; you got hit. I'm sorry I hit you like this, but I did not punch you ... I did not f'g deck you. I f'g was hitting you. I don't know what the full motion of my actual hand was, but you're FINE. I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you ... [now referring to Johnny having accidentally scraped her toe when trying to open the door:] I'm not sitting here bitching about [that], am I? You are. That's the difference between me and you. You're a f'g baby. You are such a baby. Grow the f up!""

For anyone still defending Amber, please, PLEASE take a good honest think about if that was a man saying that to a woman, and if there would be ANY doubt in your mind as to who was the abuser. There was absolutely an imperfect victim in this relationship - plenty imperfect indeed. It was not Amber. And while I expect the misandry from TERFs, I didn't expect it from genuine feminists.",58,2022-06-03T03:44:00Z,2022-06-03T04:06:44Z

@komodokommando5793,"Some disappointing words from Vaush in the opening of the video, you can't simultaneously say that you're ignorant of the Depp and Heard case, and then hold the opinion that they're equally abusive to each other.  
And then following that Vaush said that it's nothing you should care about, that Depp is a mega rich super celebrity so he can handle it himself. This is quite literally the toxic masculinity argument of ""strong men can't be abused"", replace wealth with a bodybuilding 6'8 250lb guy that gets physically hit by his smaller girlfriend, are we as progressives really gonna sit here and say it's okay since she can't hit him hard enough to hurt him, that he can manage it?
And remember the origin of MeToo, among those who spoke out from the abuse were famous actors, yet I'd be quite certain to say that no one reasonable was saying that those actors could ""handle it"" since they were wealthy and influential.
No the Depp and Heard case isn't some cultural breakthrough, but I think Vaush should either read up on the case and take a hard nuanced stance, or don't talk about it at all.",65,2022-06-03T03:01:57Z,2022-06-03T03:01:57Z

@Masterblader158,"With how Amber is more a piece of trash than a human, since evidence wise she's coming out this worse and Depp's looking better than before in people taking off support for Amber's side (though his texts even alongside how abusive she seems isn't totally right), is it really sexism? And enough it at least solely directed at her, with people stretching to make it sexist in general in a few cases.

Though I care more about some of the Pro-Amber stuff that follow in line with her tweet, auto believing she is accounting true abuse and treating the legal battle as silencing woman rather than trying to show if said abuse is real due to the impact accusations have on people, since I find maintaining the utter trash status quo in regards to abuse accusations in public opinion and in the court as worse than clowning on someone. I just want people to realise it should be actually equal in the sexes and it should be ""Always investigate"" instead of ""Always believe"" (too many people take that stance and in regards to firing someone its the auto response they take) and to understand that cases of women lying about it does occur, and one case at all is enough to change how we react especially in court of public opinion in ruining lives before hard evidence, and us as a society handling it bad needs to change and some people abusing the situation is no reason to not look for solutions to that issue, and its proving quite a lot of those people right in double standards. Though not as bad as image ruined forever by provable false accusations like MJ got.

This has been a situation where in reaction to one bad take I see mostly other bad takes as replies compared to a reasonable one. Like Anita takes in everything part of why I don't want any more Gamergates since it was also pure trash all round alongside ""You only saw what happened from one source I can tell"". I do love how its my Lesbian friend who had some of the better takes in hatred towards Amber given the bad rep they have from conservatives .

And this case being so public was good since its nice to see the absolute clown world of the court and horrible tactics being used in real time instead of waiting months to show, ""Look how bad it can still be he used how he acts in his movies as an argument on why Depp is bad"".",0,2022-06-03T02:56:53Z,2022-06-03T02:56:53Z

@miamonteverdi,"Vaush you are hysterical. You think you can just make commentary on something you readily admit you don't know anything about AND don't WANT to know anything about. Since a broken clock is right twice a day, a few of the takes you're saying in the first few minutes of this that I've watched are true (e.g. that the true crime people watching this case who are sad it's over, are fucking psychotic, that they are indeed), but so much else of your mindless rambling here is ridiculously off base.
You can't just have reliably correct takes about shit you're intentionally avoiding learning anything about.  This is a victory for male victims.  A person such as myself who would say that isn't the person who ""needed this to understand that men can be victims"" you dumbass, the braindead mainstream masses are who needed this to know that. This also wasn't ""mutual abuse"", that's such a lazy centrist take, you're being a lazy dumbshit stereotype centrist with that take. Watch moistcritical's take on this case, it's like a 5 minute video where he gives a pretty accurate summation of what went down and what the correct takeaways are from this.  I did my homework and watched this case 'cause I didn't have anything better to do and I wanted to judge for myself whether Amber was lying or not, and based on everything I saw I 100% agree with Moist's take.  This was bad for MeToo, it was good for male victims, and it was also bad for all of us because it was just a big fucking clown shitshow and all sorts of people are getting wrong-ass takes from all of this, because there's actually some nuance to be had here and most people are just not intelligent enough for that.

@devon674,"I think it's less about ""a man can be abused"" and more about ""a beautiful woman can also be a batterer"". 

I have watched/seen like none of this case; I knew all I needed to know about this case by idk, 2017 or 2019, before there was a case in court or all this hype but after some audio leaked, by years before this actually went to court I was entirely convinced that Heard had abused the shit out of Depp. The sympathy I can feel for Depp is limited by the fact that he is an ultra-wealthy famous and universally beloved celebrity. 

It's incredibly lame and nonsensical that this became a culture war issue, with the right taking Depp's side, like it's lame and nonsensical that COVID became a culture war issue (although that caused many, many hundreds or thousands of actual deaths and this has caused none).

@VagabondTE,"This is extremely disappointing.
I've been disappointed in Vaush a lot lately.  This trial is genuinely important and he's just using it as another excuse to complain about conservatives.  He wants to criticize them for not caring about male victims and yet he is completely ignoring and is flippantly dismissive of the ONE high-profile case of a male victim.  That's WHY this case is important. A man as culturally and financially powerful is Johnny Depp was horribly and horrendously abused and his abuser was able to portray him as the problem.  I don't care about gamergate, the ramifications of MeToo, or the media.  She abused him mentally and physically.  She beat him, mutilated him, and made him feel worthless.  We should be talking about this.  Not waving a hand and saying ""Duh.. it's obvious that men can be victims."" Once again Vaush is failing to uphold his own value.

I believe the case proved that there was enough evidence to ahow that there could have been abuse from Depp. Not that there was abuse. 

And Heard got the 2 mil for winning onw of her 3 statements. (Depp won all 3 of his) The jury did not get (enough) evidence to show that Amber had indeed trashed an apartment with her friends and then called 911 again to I guess frame Depp so the jury decided that claiming that was defamatory.",1,2022-06-03T01:50:25Z,2022-06-03T01:50:25Z

What Johnny Depp did is called reactive abuse and it definitely stemmed from his mother and triggers from his childhood trauma. 

But, let's be clear here, she is definitely the aggressor. She manipulates, gaslights, attacks. She lied so many times on the stand, she should be charged with perjury. Amber Heard definitely had a narcissistic trash parent that created her.

@valathe,"the problem here is that this case wasn't about who abused whom, that has already been settled. the high court in the UK ruled that the sun newspaper was well within their rights to call depp a wifebeater because, well, he is a wifebeater. this case in the US was purely about whether or not amber heard is *allowed to talk about it*, and in this context the verdict is much more troubling. this will have an enormous chilling effect on the willingness of victims of abuse to come forward with their allegations.",6,2022-06-03T01:29:31Z,2022-06-03T01:29:31Z
