@slotenmakerdenhaag,"Honestly Beeb, here is some political education for you my friends:

The BBC has given a whole lot of attention to Luigi Mangione (I guess because the amount of positive comments his shooting of a CEO in the health industry has generated on social media is absolutely massive) It is all directed at undermining the revolutionary nature of his act. Firstly, the title of this article implies there is some sort of connection to the maffia (powerful Italians must be maffia right?). But then they go on to emphasise how priviliged Luigi Mangione is. This seems like an attempt to discredit his actions as any way related to class: make sure everyone understands Mangione is not a member of the working class who of course suffer much more from being denied proper health care. (According to classic Marxist theory the middle-classes have no revolutionary inclinations, though Marx himself came from a wealthy industrial family.)

I say the BBC is carefully and dogedly manipulating public opinion.

Anyone agree with this evaluation?

@Britephartt,The BBC are obsessed by this story but seem not to understand what a appalling monster this man was.

Maybe the BBC bosses get paid too much and empathise with other filthy rich greedy sociopaths.
