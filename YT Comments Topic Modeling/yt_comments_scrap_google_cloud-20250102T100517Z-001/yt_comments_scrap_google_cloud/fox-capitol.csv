Greetings
Well, here is what I believe.

There is something altogether and completely wrong going on in The United States of America today.
And it starts with this. 
I never would have dreamed that's all of those combined forces of  Federal Law enforcement officers who were on Capitol Hill or were within traveling distance, such as, Homeland Security, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Fire Arms and Explosives The Drug Enforcement Administration, The Secret Service, The Federal Protective Services, and the FBI, I never in a million years would have dreamed that all of you all would not have rushed to the relief of the Whitehouse on January 6th during the rampage. I never would have believed that thousands of well trained, sworn Federal officers could be ""spooked"" into ""sheltering in place"" while they watched the extremely violent seiged of their own nation's Capitol. These are sworn Federal men and women. Who got too ""spooked"" to do their jobs and just sat there watching the action on their television sets, waiting for the whole thing to be over, let everyone in the Whitehouse be massacred. ""They are in danger. We're not"". An E-mail or memorandum either ""spooked‚Äù the Federal Officers,  or stunned, or tased them into a situation of treason. Yes, it seems like Treason by default to me. It seems to me that Treason was the default setting for all of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers on Capitol Hill on January. The rioters expected to be stopped. The rioters expected to encounter stiff opposition, man to man combat from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers, not a coy womanly demurrer, that they experienced as thousands of Federal Officers suddenly ""boycotted"" the Whitehouse or went on ,""strike"" during the Jan 6th riots.
 Nobody inside the Whitehouse or outside the Whitehouse expected sworn Federal Law Enforcement Officers on to do what they did or to do what they failed to do, ""come out of the closet.""

It's also very strange that not even one of the other academic news reporters, or investigative news reporters  have grilled the Federal Law Enforcement organizations about why  this sudden ""lapse"" of motivation to protect or defend suddenly came over them, overshadowed them and sapped their will to fight? 

I must be what is commonly known as an ""idealist"".  What is that, Ruth. Well, it's a person 

the practice of forming or pursuing ideals, especially unrealistically.
""the idealism of youth"" noun. a person who cherishes or pursues high or noble principles, purposes, goals, etc. a visionary or impractical person. a person who represents things as they might or should be rather than as they are: My friend is an idealist, who somehow thinks that we always agree.
satisfying one's conception of what is perfect; most suitable.
""the swimming pool is ideal for a quick dip""
Similar:
perfect
best possible
consummate
supreme
absolute
complete
copybook
flawless
faultless
without fault
exemplary
classic
archetypal
model
ultimate
quintessential
Opposite:
bad
2.
existing only in the imagination; desirable or perfect but not likely to become a reality.
""in an ideal world, we might have made a different decision""
Similar:
unattainable
unachievable
impracticable


This is a Theological Investigation of the into this matter of the conduct of the highest ranking law enforcement agencies in the land. Even to the point of having international links around the world, and all kinds of diplomatic immunities.
Was it the CIA that ""spooked"" Federal Law Enforcement Officers into sheltering in place.
It has been my understanding that the CIA does not operate directly into the domestic affairs. Was it witchcraft? Was everyone bewitched that day? 
Witchcraft, believe it or not, Witchcraft is a highly respected American historical tradition here in the United States of America.
And I would like to offer the subjective conjecture that there was definitely Witchcraft activity on Capitol Hill on January 6th. This is a Theological perspective.

Sincerely,
gospelgirl",1,2023-01-04T00:19:31Z,2023-01-04T00:19:31Z

@mysticbengals521,"Seriously. The only points of organized are: 1) the notice antifa posted a week or days prior stating they'd attend to stir people up and provoke chaos. 2) the interesting way local police were seen escorting a crowd of obvious antifa in. 3) the strange way the Capitol police initially basically allowed many protesters into the building. Hmmmm. Trump did not incite violence. In fact in his speech he seemed sincerely hopeful and stated pence could stop the process legally. Now with that speech what person would think the thing to do is break in go crazy and prevent what Trump said was hopeful. Etc .. So no this media report is as usual blatantly incorrect. Add most of the protestors were peaceful and were not remotely involved with the behavior of a small number of people in that crowd. Of course the long videos of all those people, the majority, not doing anything wrong are literally oddly being deleted. Hmmmmmm. Hmmmm indeed. And while the weeks and months of crazed violent rioting looting stealing burning cities down destroying local businesses terrorizing people at cafe's battering elderly people on the streets and then taking to the suburbs to terrorize residents a short time ago -- well their actions were always called mostly peaceful protests, that went on and on  for weeks and weeks and weeks. But one incident at the Capitol created by people who where a mix of antifa and unhinged peoplee who happened to likely vote for Trump while the vast majority of Trump supporters had NOTHING to do with those that broke in. Back to Trump's speech-- it stated Pence and some Senators could change the outcome towards a second term for Trump. Hid speech did not say ""Get in there it's hopeless"" or ""Get in there and attack everything and everyone?"". Oh but the media spin. The crooked spin.

@TSM8088,":
The age of the the ""Party"", ""Big Brother"", and the ""Ministry of Truth"" is now upon us fellow patriots..

""The process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs --- to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or idealogical significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be show by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place...""

@Raising.hell.,"I‚Äôm sure these matters will continue to escalate. I feel 2021 is just barely getting started and I hope these representatives will remember that they are supposed to be serving the peoples best interest of this country and not their own interests.. Also until there is supreme equality among ALL citizens, government officials included, will there be some form of normalcy returned back from the people.... Failures happen but trying to ignore them doesn‚Äôt make it go away, it makes matters worse. This is like bad parenting in a higher level. Another thing, it‚Äôs sad to say that the people who lost their businesses in the summer of love never got this kind of coverage.... Goes to show who‚Äôs the real important one.....Some old government building compared to people‚Äôs business is way more important and gets way more coverage.... WOW‚Äî- way to go media and government officials for added fuel to the flames when the people on both sides should be blaming the ones who are supposed to have our best interests at heart... All this blame needs to go to the correct persons in charge, and it‚Äôs certainly NOT us, never really has been more than a mere idea.. Amd the establishment of a president is just a a distraction, a scapegoat, for the people to think they are in charge....

Had the people in charge empowered law enforcement to stop protestors months ago, the people today never would have been comfortable enough to even think about attempting to breach the capital building. If you noticed, nothing in the building was broken, burned or vandalized,  but everyone is amazed that this happened, again because it was ""The Capital Building"". Really?  I think they should be handled just like the rest of the protestors and just let it slide. I think the loss of life, destruction of businesses, and property damage and injuries endured by law inforcement across the US is much worse that the Capital being breached.

Trump has another chance to run in 2024 but there is a very strong chance we will never see a Republican win the presidency again in our lifetimes,  as there were 28 million VBM ballots that were never returned which was more then enough to make up Biden's deficit on election night and his margin of victory.

Judges and Justices have been tossing out cases left and right without hearing any of them and refusing to even read the evidence submitted. They've all punted, not wanting to deal with it. The media and big tech are censoring the free speech of anyone who raises concerns about the election results.  State and Federal election laws have been ignored with impunity and then the results have been certified as legitimate with some of those certifications accomplished with threats of violence, and audits of ballots has either been outright rejected or carried out in a haphazard fashion with similar shenanigans as originally caused the concerns over the election results in the first place...the storming of the United States Capital is the natural result that follows the accommodation of ignoring election laws and denying any redness of concerns through legal means, and if those concerns continue to be ignored, the situation will continue to escalate. It wouldn't take much more escalation at this point to become a second Revolution/ Civil War. 

The primary difference now from times past, is the group that's always been the law abiding group, is starting to ignore the law like the Left has for many months burning down cities, because if you truly believe your vote will always be stolen from you going forward, it's either accept your new serfdom or revolt.",0,2021-01-07T05:35:01Z,2021-01-07T05:35:01Z

@simplicity6564,"There is nothing here to be proud of.  So many things have gone wrong during these last four years, and most of it due to greed for power and money.  Yet, the majority of it due to mental illness.  The costs are high in lives, decency, the deficit, but, mostly to our country as a whole.  Yeah, everyone wants what they want, but that's impossible.  It will never happen that way.  There's no doubt our leaders in the House and Senate, state and federal, have to stop dividing and making it a winner take all game.  Nobody wins in a winner takes all, because all is destroyed in the process.  There needs to be moderation.  Less extreme from both sides.  Less sides and more intermingling.  Get rid of the DNC and RNC.  Add term limits, especially to the federal Senate.  Remove as much of the money from politics as possible in the forms of contributions and lobbying efforts.  Maybe, just maybe, if we'd all start meeting closer to the middle, we'd not flip the boat over, like almost happened today.",0,2021-01-07T01:41:29Z,2021-01-07T01:41:29Z

I saw frustrated people that saw their livelihoods taken away, Pelosi playing games by inserting the word gender equality in a financial recovery bill 32 times and hoping to blame the bad parts on her Republican adversaries,  The slow monopolization of power in cities,  and now an election with exemptions to protocol, including Chain of Custody procedures handling ballots, culpable observers at election precincts versus ‚Äòtehee I don‚Äôt know anything,‚Äô and the ballots being able to be submitted after election day, when the official ballots have mostly been reported and tallied by the first day afterwards, with huge spikes and Biden votes by predominantly blue counties that are almost solely the counties that haven‚Äôt finished reporting, we saw errors in voting machines almost predominantly in Biden‚Äòs favor.

In the dream, U.S. protestors stormed the Capitol building just like they are doing now.  And, certain republicans were claiming that they won the presidency in my vision too.  The news media was everywhere on Capitol Hill, and Trump was claiming that he won-just like now.  In my vision, the elections were fair, but, after the protestors stormed the U.S. Capitol and were stopped, when the next morning came in America , there were bombings everywhere in America, and a foreign invasion with members of our own government at the helm of it happened.  America was destroyed almost immediately, and the protestors that had stormed Capitol Hill were then trying to just help save America-but to no avail.  And, no politicians were able to go back to work on Capitol Hill, because a lot of them were gone, and it was bombed to the ground, and a foreign power-which was not from Europe had taken control over America.  Then I saw the former American president go to a Temple in Israel and claim to be the second coming of Christ-he said, ""I am the Chosen One!  I am your Christ!"".  All hell broke out in Israel immediately too, and then Armageddon commenced, and the entire world was thrown into hell.  I could hear someone who was hurt off in the distance in both America and Israel, and they kept yelling to God for help, and saying ""Let Thy raiment come down, Oh Lord, let Thy raiment come down.

@deadcenterarts29,"It saddens me to see this.. but when you think about what's happened over the past 4 years.... the fact there's been absolutely no justice in our justice department. The blatant coup attempt over the past four years of establishment politicians in both parties to remove Trump because of the threat that he presents to their corruption. And when they got caught, the investigations to investigate the corrupt were fake .Then there was cover-up by the news media of said coup attempt... then you had members of Congress calling for violence and harassment targeting trump supporters,and the media covered it up. Next the orchestrated sham impeachment trial... attempting frame Trump for doing in Ukraine what Biden actually did. Falsely accusing Trump supporters of being racist then attacking them in the streets. Through all of this there was no justice none at all.... then they stole the election, prevented investigation and went as far as shredding ballots. And after all of that  Trump supporters stood by as  peaceful citizens work through the system to obtain Justice. In the end they realized that their government ,the media and the legal system  have been completely and utterly  corrupted... today they finally had enough.",0,2021-01-06T22:53:27Z,2021-01-06T22:53:27Z

@amandayother9196,Sorry folks but what you are seeing is the same thing we witnessed during the George Floyd protests. Trim supporters have no thus far resorted to violence and destruction to make their point...this is imposters trying to sew seeds of hate. And as far as discusting behavior I do agree just like it was discusting behavior in the aftermath of George Floyd being killed. But I would also like to point out that Trump supporters did take their grievance to the steps of the Capitol. They are at least intelligent enough not to punish their neighbors or business owners in their communities for the atrocities being carried out against this country and it's citizens by those very people elected to protect them. At least they know where the true enemy and threat to this country lies.,0,2021-01-06T22:30:45Z,2021-01-06T22:30:45Z

Fools! This is exactly what started the expansion of a certain german leader in the 1930s when they appeased him and believed his words of peace and reconciliation, when in just 2 years after that, he had rearmed germany and started the 2nd world war. people really need to wake up, as i think many people are stuck in this way of thinking that things will be bad but more or less the same country, when in reality this is precisely the sequence of events which fascists use to take over a country.",0,2021-01-06T22:30:41Z,2021-01-06T22:30:41Z

@Sdewebb,This is what ticks me off. The Security should have been increased. If you have ever served in the military you're familiar with operations orders. It's how we operate. Intel would have told these people that today of all days you triple or quadruple Security and you install better barriers than just glorified bicycle racks. These guys would never survive overseas. The rioters over there all have AK 47s. They underestimated the situation and someone needs to be held accountable. Oh and the President caused all this crap.

@sharpservicestn,I don't forget they also settle their differences with cheating lying fake news propaganda to enrage everybody and then when someone is enraged to this point. And think they have no other choice then to act. that's why you don't holler fire in a movie theater and we've allowed it to happen for 4 years now. I hope they get it settled down but to allow this to keep going on people push  fake news constantly and then demonizing someone that's why his supporters jump the rails or it could be a setup paid protesters to make it look like he did something who knows anymore. It should be against the law to report fake news especially enraging emotional. Just like screaming fire in a theater,0,2021-01-06T21:44:57Z,2021-01-06T21:44:57Z
