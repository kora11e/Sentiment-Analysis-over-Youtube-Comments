@mcguerd8,"It is amazing how media in US and US led vassal states pretend as if most recent events in Syria were unexpected while everybody else was expecting this for years but not knowing the exact time. Turkey had been preventing it for years by trying to control HTS but could not stop it after the deal was reached to end the war in Ukraine. The military part of the operation started to be prepared in Napoli (Nato headquartes for the Mediterrenean) nine months ago by a joint workgroup of soldiers from UK, US, France and Israel, all  specialized on Syria. The plan was handed over to MI6 and CIA to prepare the theater. Other members of Nato were informed with their assignments and the operation started 6 hours after the Lebanon-Israel ceasefire. Therefore HTS just drove all the way from Idlib to Damascus just like driving from the east coast to the west coast without any fighting or resistance. What is expected in the future is a more terrible civil fight due to a terribly divided society in Syria probably followed by destabilizing Iran, either using the Pejak in Iran with support of former  PKK and now SDG or preferably a war between Turkey and Iran as stated openly by some so called strategy creeps.Since Turkey is a Nato country, it will justify Nato's war on Iran.

@Ibn_Abdulaziz,"Those who believe that the world is God's work (creation) conclude that bringing it about requires Perfect Knowledge and Ability. And this means that the world around us necessitate Perfect Attributes for God. 

Now, is it possible for the Owner of such Perfect Attributes to ever do anything with falsehood, injustice, vain and indifference? No, because such shortcomings would violate the Perfect Attributes that His work (creation) around you necessitated for Him. And thus the conclusion is that the world exists with truth and justice i.e for the Day of Judgement. And thus sins are antithesis to the truth that we just arrived at as the world around us always reminds us of the Day of Accountability.

But those who say that that bringing about this world does not necessitate Knowledge and Ability, but chance, inanimate atoms smashing into one another, then these committed polytheism and arrived at nihilism; that there's no purpose, no truth ever but that everyone vanishes into non-existence with one another and that this life is it, so might as well do whatever we feel like. And thus sins becomes justified. These ascribed equals to God and shortcomings.

It's true that Syria has many ethnic and religious groups, but many of them, including the Sunni majority, were brutally oppressed by assad and his regime. That's why, yes, most people are at least happy about getting rid of this dictator once and for all and bringing back some hope to the country, which most syrians thought was hopeless. 
At the same time, people are worried about what will come, especially minorities, which is very justifiable, but at least let us be happy with a Syria free of Assad. At least say congrats to the Syrian people and hope for the better to come.",4,2024-12-11T17:19:13Z,2024-12-11T17:29:25Z

Along his two criminal advisers, Sullivan and Blinken, he arms Ukrainian fascist to die for their cowardly hatreds of Russia.

@lennarthallberg9918,"!The UN and practically the whole international mainstream media did not know what to say about Israel for a couple of days when they realized that Russia, Iran and their puppet ruler Assad were not anymore in charge over Syria. But it took only a couple of days for the UN and the international mainstream media to find a new way to criticize Israel. Now they accuse Israel for ""land grab"" and ""taking advantage over the situation in Syria"".  

The UN and the international mainstream media did not analyze ""the situation in Syria"", as they call it,  at all from Israel's perspective despite they all recognized a real and high risk that Syria could be ruled by extreme jihadists in the very near future and not by a peaceful coalition. The international mainstream media has stated only that the Arab League has criticized Israel for land grab and so has the UN too. This new way of criticizing Israel only because they are ensuring that their country is as safe as possible if the new Syria becomes a hostile Jihadist enemy to Israel shows once again how negative and hostile the UN and the international media are towards Israel, sad to say. 

One of the cruelest dictatorships in modern times just fell in Syria much thanks to Israel's fight against Iran and their violent proxies and all the UN and the international mainstream media has to say is that Israel should not only stop protecting themselves against their old enemies, but also stop protecting themselves against their potential new enemies. No responsible leader would do what the UN and the international mainstream media demand Israel to do time after time.",1,2024-12-11T11:07:23Z,2024-12-11T11:07:23Z

@devinreis5811,"With Syria, there's too much that doesn't make sense. Russia backed the Syrian government until 2016, because they f'ed around and found out; they found out that the Syrian government really was using chemical weapons, blew the whistle and nobody believed them until it was convenient for people to believe them. Israel is just defending their territory after Syria illegally annexed Golan Heights, while supporting the Kurds. Turkey is backing multiple groups, knowing that those groups are terrorists. The best that could happen is that a government that was the way it was before socialism was enacted in Syria; the Assad regime was socialist. Before socialism in Syria, Jews, Christians, and Muslims coexisted. After the rise of socialism, look what happened. There's too much uncertainty about Syria.

@mbvgvskvrs868,"""Assad was brutal."" ""Saddam Hussein was a monster."" ""Assad was a butcher."" This is how the US MIC manufactures consent for forever wars of genocidal regime change allover the world. Take note of all YTbers who support such violent illegal regime changes as happened in Syria. They are the internet gatekeepers working for the MIC by justifying unspeakable evil. That's why they recruit viewers to agree with war-mongers like John Bolton. That's why they sell Empire news outlets like the UK Financial Times. The US/NATO axis used head-chopping genocidal jihadist mercenaries to violently overthrow another democratically legally-elected government in west Asia. If the US/NATO axis was sincere about helping Syria, they would have supported democratic elections monitored by the UN. But the colonizers did not want a Sunni majority country to vote for the President Assad because that would have destroyed the Sunni-Shia divide narrative.

After 10 years of riots, wars and separatism, Syria will continue to face problems such as inflation, shortages and outflow of human resources, migration to Europe and elsewhere, and terrorist groups that will use the instability of the new government to create problems. It will also face external interference from neighbors and from far away. And eventually, the problems will return because the state is not united. A good friend today is an enemy in the future. This is what I have learned from the conflict. If you disagree, that's fine. This is just my personal experience from what I've seen outside of similar events around the world.

@OneLine122,"I was wondering how you would blame Israel somehow.
So Turkey arms and unleashes rebels on the Syrian government. It's fine, nothing to see here. It's not immoral or anything, regime change is a good thing. Assad killed a lot of people.
Then let's looks at ""mainstream media"". They like the regime change. They are all idiots because jihadists are in power and it will create more problems in the future because of Cenk's keys to geopolitics, always complain about your own country.
The let's look at Israel. OMG!! they took a few kilometers of a demilitarized zone that is now wide open because the Assad regime does not exist. The whole thing was always about allowing Israel to get some more land, the MONSTERS!! üòÇ
I guess it's the type of thing people might buy if they have the attention span of a moth and forget what they just said two minutes ago.

In any case, Syria has been in the plan for regime change by the US since Iraq was invaded. Obama was supposed to do it and he messed up, tried to ignore it and was forced to act anyway. Then Trump came and put a big wrench in the plan, which is in part why people wanted to impeach him. See, the Cheney plan does not care about who actually rules the place, it's about who does not, mainly Russia. So it's a win for the US establishment. Now they can focus on Iran which so happens to be fragile because Russia is busy and on it's knees, it played almost all it's cards, so deterrence is not there anymore. So it's quite historic, it's a major piece of geopolitics that resolved and it's why people rejoice. Refugees in Turkey will come back to their homes, the majority Sunnis will be in charge as well so it's more likely to be stable than it was, but it pretty much had to happen whether you like it or not. If people talk about the border with Iraq, it's because Kurds live there, and they want a country. Not everything is about Israel.",1,2024-12-10T12:20:42Z,2024-12-10T12:20:42Z

From the oil industry perspective, (obviously human lives has never mattered ever, thus not in the discussion), investors of the east med pipeline after randos (?) blew up the Russian line, likely wanted a backup plan for the EU money making people tax as well as not fund antagonizing factions ""Hamas"", Hezbollah Iran, Syria Russa, that backup pipeline is likely Gaza to Lebonon, to Syria, connecting to Turkey (Turkey created an economic zone to Libya, thus forcing to be involved as well as  they were supposed to be a part of the Israel gas giant investment thru Cypriot. Oil industries from their entitled, above all law,  answers to no one, enormous greed, saw gaza as risk that licensing Palestinian maritime claims would feed terrorist, and Iran, using Hezbollah to slow down progress of anything that would hurt Iranian fuel/oil profits with stiffwr competition.  My bet will be they build pipelines to TANAP as a redundant pipeline.   Russia is in on this as well, probably will take Ukraine and Trump will let them take it.

Sorry guys but all the geopolitical shit you mentioned and your analysis has no meaning for the syrians. We got rid of the bloodiest and cruelest regime in the history and we did it fast and clean without hurting the minorities which you always concern about. you forget that Assad is a criminal dictator that hurt ALL the ethnic and sectarian groups in Syria.

Assad was supposed to be fired from his post after the disastrous showing in 1967 war against Israel but was retained  due to a favor by another politician. 

Ironically, the Assad family ruled Syria for exactly 54 years as Hafez Assad did his coup against the legislative council in November and December of 1970. The rest is history with his brutal suppression of mainly Sunnis in Syria. Sunnis couldn‚Äôt be completely disregarded but Alawites were overly represented in the military and intelligence.

@gx240yt,"Cenk, you're making a fool of yourself by attributing all of this to some shadowy conspiracy. In military history it is not uncommon for a regime locked in a prolonged conflict to suddenly disintegrate purely due to its own internal dynamics.

Assad's forces had low morale for years. They weren't being paid regularly or sufficiently. The regime loses a battle in one city, and morale drops even lower. That causes them to run from the next battle. And the next. And the next... Pretty soon no one believes the regime can win anymore, so no one fights. Then the whole system collapses in a few days. History is full of such examples. There's no conspiracy; they just lost.",8,2024-12-10T03:54:25Z,2024-12-10T03:54:25Z

Many people especially online white wash Gaddafi now because of how badly Libya descended into further anarchy after he was gone. Since there‚Äôs a good chance Syria will follow this path (though not guaranteed as nothing is) I can imagine people trying to do the same thing with Assad. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that these regimes were brutal and were terrible and it was precisely because they were so brutal and terrible that enough people in these countries were willing to rise up and fight for years to bring them down. Much gets made about how the MENA region needs strongmen dictators to keep order but we‚Äôve also seen time and again how these strongmen also seem to fall with regularity as well. Whatever comes next for Syria, if it‚Äôs worse or better, the fact remains Assad couldn‚Äôt have been the answer to Syria‚Äôs problems and never was.

@Oliver-j9k5c,"Vance called Trump Hitler, openly lies about democrats supporting abortion up to the moment of birth, calls a pregnancy from rape an inconvenience, and lied about Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear saying he said he wished for a member of his family to get raped knowing he was referring to him having to deal with an unwanted pregnancy. Regarding his military service and the stolen valor accusations of Walz, it's nonsense. Vance wasn‚Äôt asked to ""serve"" in that ill-conceived war, he didn‚Äôt have a choice. JD served in public affairs rather than on the front lines. As a junior enlisted Marine at the start of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), his options were to deploy as ordered or face a Court Martial for desertion, dereliction of duty, and other charges, potentially landing him in Leavenworth at the USDB. 

Vance's Claim That He LOADED His Guns After Trump Shooting DOESN'T MAKE SENSE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4sMyEwUIG4

Walz was close to retirement when 9/11 happened but delayed it for another four years. As a Command Sergeant Major, he wasn't going to be out on patrol; he was focused on performing the high-level duties expected of someone at the E9 rank. If there had been a significant need, he could have been placed under ‚Äústop loss‚Äù and prevented from retiring. At his age he was eligible to retire which is the typical retirement age that is a common decision for many, but more notably, he retired to run for Congress on a platform focused on ending the war. He campaigned by highlighting the devastation caused by the war and later voted to bring all troops home within 90 days. He could have retired earlier but he stayed in longer. He submitted his paperwork for his Congressional run in early 2005. A few months later he submitted his paperwork for retirement, a few months after that is when the deployment orders to go to Iraq for his Battalion came out so he didn't know in early 2005. Later that year there would be deployment orders.

Trump is a literal draft Dodger. He avoided service in the Vietnam War through student and medical deferments. He said he got a medical deferment for a bone spur in a foot but couldn't remember which foot. When he talked about it in 2015 he reportedly called soldiers who died in war suckers and losers and he also called his sex life in the 80s his own personal Vietnam.

Contrary to the right wing media lies and propaganda there is no policy requiring tampons in boys' bathrooms; instead, the law provides menstrual products in gender-neutral and girls' bathrooms. Democrats are never advocating for switching genders to those who do not want to. Consider this; Would you prefer being with a person who you dont know what is like on the inside because they are keeping it a secret? They will feel comfortable with who they are and you get to know what they are really like.

@Oliver-j9k5c,"Trump supporters have attacked figures like Nancy Pelosi's husband, an incident Trump later mocked, and even attempted to kidnap a Democratic governor after Trump publicly criticized her. Nevertheless, the claim is that Biden and Harris have been the true instigators of violence. Trump has encouraged and laughed at violent actions from his side numerous times. When he warns people about danger, he‚Äôs only concerned when it affects him. He jokes about Pelosi's husband being attacked with a hammer but takes offense if anything happens to him, showing clear hypocrisy in his reactions to political violence. Trump tweeted that Pence ""didn't have the courage to do what should have been done"" to stop the certification of the election. Which in 60 court cases later with judges even appointed by Trump, failed to provide any evidence. In December 2022, Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. Constitution could be disregarded, stating that a ""massive fraud"" allows for the ""termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" Making Trump and the GOP the biggest threat to American democracy in US history. After Donald Trump learned that his supporters were chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" during the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Trump showed indifference or even approval. According to Hutchinson, Trump reportedly said, ""He doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing anything wrong"" and expressed that Pence ""deserved it."" When told that his supporters were armed, Trump allegedly said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not here to hurt me,‚Äù further fueling concern about his stance on the mob‚Äôs actions. Most acts of terror in the US are caused by right wingers. Something the right wing media makes sure to not inform its viewers to distract them for the corporate elite.

@Oliver-j9k5c,"RFK Jr. said Trump was ""a terrible human being. The worse [sic] president ever and barely human. He is probably a sociopath."" He criticized President Trump for failing to deliver on his promises to American workers. He accused Trump of promising to revive manufacturing, raise wages, fix trade deals, close tax loopholes, and support small farmers, but instead, catering to the interests of the Republican establishment. According to RFK Jr., Trump's achievements primarily benefited wealthy individuals like Jeff Bezos, deregulated industries for special interests, and provided advantages to large agricultural conglomerates.

RFK Jr. pointed out that Trump allowed influential figures from the Bush-era GOP to dominate his administration, appointing lobbyists from the oil, gas, coal, and pharmaceutical industries to key positions. He also criticized Trump for supposedly supporting small farmers but ultimately funneling funds to large agricultural corporations.

He highlighted the social unrest during Trump's presidency, noting the significant rioting and looting, and accused Trump of inflaming racial tensions and failing to maintain public safety. Instead of addressing the chaos, RFK Jr. argued that Trump allowed Democrat-run cities to burn for political optics.

On foreign policy, RFK Jr. condemned Trump for unilaterally withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty with Russia, which destabilized relations and exacerbated tensions between Ukraine and Russia, leading to war. He also criticized Trump's appointments of neoconservatives like John Bolton, HR McMaster, and Robert O‚ÄôBrien, suggesting that Lindsey Graham might become his Secretary of State in a second term.

RFK Jr. further accused Trump of bombing Syria, killing an Iranian general, and failing to end the war in Afghanistan. He blamed Trump for initiating lockdowns during the pandemic, which he said led to the closure of millions of small businesses and a significant transfer of wealth to billionaires.

Lastly, RFK Jr. claimed that Trump did little to address the opioid crisis, which worsened during his presidency, while his appointees were aligned with the interests of big pharma. He concluded by warning that a second Trump term would likely bring more of the same. In his words ""If you think a second Trump term would be any different, you are engaging in wishful thinking.""

These statements came out merely two months before he threw his support behind Trump. After the Democrats denied him airtime for his unfounded vax conspiracy theories and pro Kremlin aligned propaganda points, he sacrificed any remaining integrity and appears to have opted for a path of bitter revenge.

@Oliver-j9k5c,"There's a man that engaged in an insurrection‚Ä¶. do you approve? And SCOTUS delays
There is a man in New York that tried to hide his past before an election ... do you approve? Convicted on 34 counts
There's a man that rapes a woman and molests others... do you approve? Adjudicated $92 mil
What if a man keeps secret sensitive files in unsecured ways.... do you approve? And his judge delays indefinitely
What if a man conspires to steal votes... do you approve? 4/19 plead guilty
What if a man cooks the books and steals from the people... do you approve? Adjudicated $463 mil
These are just 6 undisputed questions. Is this the type of person you will support at the sake of losing your own respect?

Drumpf: three times this year he has been adjudicated as a sex offender, company fraudster, and now faces 34 class E felony charges with up to 4 years in jail for falsifying records to cover up his infidelities prior to the 2016 elections that may have changed the result of who would be president of the United States of America! So much for election integrity.

2016 election campaign: five of Drumpf's staff were found guilty of crimes that were used to help Drumpf become president, only to have Drumpf pardon them.
2020 election campaign: five of Drumpf's staff have pleaded guilty to their part in trying illegally to change the outcome of the election, and nearly 55 more people have been indicted in five states for their part in trying to overturn the election with the fake electors.
In business: his personal lawyer was found guilty of crimes related to the 2016 election. The CFO of Trump Co. was found guilty of financial crimes in the company's name and has been to prison twice due to these.

The GOP contender for president has announced that in the event that a delinquent NATO country gets invaded by Russia, he ""would encourage them to do whatever they like."" Article 5 has only been used once, and that was after the September 11 attack on the USA. Is this the true ""Manchurian candidate"" via the Kremlin?

FAKE NEWS has found its father, Mr. Pecker of the ""National Enquirer,"" and Donald Drumpf is its GODFATHER.

I wonder what Daddy and Granddaddy would say about their prodigy turning their name into a term that will go down in history as rich people begging; let's call it ""TRUMPING FOR MONEY.""

I think Little Donald, going by his latest rallies, must be using ""Baby Shark, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo"" to hype himself up with before the rallies, what do you think?

Not that this has anything to do with the election (he is not a politician) or the computer from hell, but for the record, Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony counts regarding his 2nd amendment by misreporting on a firearm license.

05/23/24: US Inflation Rate is at 3.36%, compared to 3.48% last month and 4.93% last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2024, January 2020 2.5%. The U.S. job market expanded in April for the 40th consecutive month, but at a slower pace. 175,000 new jobs were added in April, unemployment rate 3.7%, May 272,000 nearly 100,000 over expectation, January 2020 2.5%. The Dow posted its all-time high during trading on May 16, 2024, reaching a peak of 40,051.05 points making 401k higher, under Trump on January 2020 28,600. The reason you feel poor is that Drumpf and Lara at the GOP keep asking for your last dollar.
