@psychicbyinternet,"Bill Burr is way more based now and it's great that he left behind his more edgy stuff but his earlier stuff is very misogynistic.  Like he had a bit where he disagreed with the expression ""there's no reason to hit a woman,"" and he's never walked any of that back, just switched to less reactionary material which is still good but some of his early bits were so vile.  So he leaves a bad taste in my mouth even though I used to be a huge fan (back when I was an anti feminist and I loved Jordan Peterson lmao).",0,2024-12-20T04:47:47Z,2024-12-20T04:50:48Z

*Posting one ""Essay on Governance"" for Left and Right, hope you are curious and smart enough to explore and understand it.
The (Almost) perfect Rule for and of Law for a country, in a governmental context, lies on the foundation of these works: 
Novum Organum (Francis Bacon 1620); Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (Spinoza 1670); Two Treatises of Government (John Locke 1689); The Spirit of Laws (Montesquieu 1750); On Crimes and Punishments (Cesare Beccaria 1764); The Wealth of Nations (Adam Smith 1776); Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (1791) & The Age of Reason (1794); and Evolutionary Socialism: Criticism and Affirmation (Eduard Bernstein 1899).
Combined, it promotes results for a strong and stable EFI; HDI; FSI; GPI and GCI.
It also aligns with the emergence of AI in substitution of most jobs in the Tertiary service sector.
Absolute Rule (Autocracy/Supreme Leader Rule/Dictatorship) if recreated, we would need to invert the meaning of these works mentioned above on score (opposite), a combination which is inferior to the other formerly referenced. 
If so, Marxism-Leninism, Naz/Fascism and Religious Fundamentalism, while being all different, end up being authoritarian with means to an end, despotism.
Even Neoliberalism leads into an Oligarchy unless balanced socially, in which it rejects so. 
A body of men, holding themselves accountable to nobody, should not be trusted by anybody, only by logic, progress and reason.
Going to recommend searching Foundations of Geopolitics: Future of Russia (1997) about its geopolitical plan in the world and how it manipulates it for its interest and dynamics for strategic benefit, just to show an example on how the system of this type acts.
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, in the amount of time since itself.
One must not fall for fear and hatred in exchange for own self rights, having a more secure border/state is possible in a constitutional republic/monarchy, by not admitting/deporting only undocumented people creating weight on economic security without a contract/job on the work sectors or with repeated crimes, because if total, it risks the loss of labour and an increase in consumption cost/production. 
Dictatorships aren't necessary to solve such problems. 
All these ideologies try to alienate the inherent dialectics of progress within our natural cycles of change in time, in history, in this world and universe beyond.

@ccan276,"I'd be homeless, in a wheelchair and close to death, if not already, if I lived in the USA. Having a chronic congenital illness, I've needed surgeries, medications, and ongoing treatment from both a GP and a consultant.  Fortunately, I live in Australia, and it doesn't  cost a cent. I get ongoing world-class care, cheap or free medications, and subsidised medical aids. I pay nothing for an ambulance and $ 30 for a consultation and new glasses. Universal health care has been life-saving for me, and so many families and friends. You break your arm,  go to the hospital, and  walk out  treated and with follow-up care organised. The only reason I touch my wallet is to give them my Medicare number. I live in Australia and am so grateful for our health care system.  Australia's results are, on average, better than the OECD's average for many of  the indicators measuring health care.  I can't understand why a wealthy country like the USA can't afford universal health care for it's citizens . It actually saves money overall.

@harryhoudini714,"Do you know the story of ""Damocles Sword""?

In short, Damocles is a King and one day his Fool says ""oh my King, how great your life is, you are the King, you can do whatever you want and dont have to carry the burdens us common Folk are subjected to"", the King looks at him and says ""you think so? well, how about I make you King for a day so you can also enjoy the privileges of my position?"". The Fool first thinks he is joking but after realizing he means it, he gladly accepts and is allowed to take his place on the Throne but before he sits down, the King orders his men to get a hair of the tail of a Horse and tie a Sword at its hilt on one end and tie the other end right above the Throne so that the Sword points down on the Throne, high enough to be lethal if the hair breaks.

The Fool sits down on the Throne but he sees the deadly Sword right above his Head hanging on nothing but a single hair of a Horses Tail. He moves nervously back and forth filled with the fear that anytime the Sword may fall down on his head killing him instantly. Then he stands up in Protest and says ""thats not fair! when you were sitting here, there was no Sword, why did you put a Sword up there?"", the King replies, ""thats what you think! when you are King, that Sword is always up there!""

There is a reason why only few can reach the top! the competition, the danger, the responsibility is too much for many to handle and that is how it should be! Lets not forget, the higher you are up, the more Power you have over People. As a King for example, you command whole Armies that can destroy whole Nations and their People. Such a Power can never be left unchecked since the Danger of someone misusing it causing great pain is far too great!

That is why people on top must always be reminded of the consequences of their actions. That is why Bill Burr is right when he says ""CEOs should be afraid"", they should be so they dont think they can play around with Human lives and get away with it without consequences.",0,2024-12-13T13:41:42Z,2024-12-13T13:41:42Z

So I think it's wrong to state that 401k holders are a more liable for blame when the opposite is likely true and it's pensions that are benefitting to a greater degree.",0,2024-12-13T13:19:09Z,2024-12-13T13:19:09Z

@jmwild1,"The ACA was a foundation for something better, but of course the GOP had no intention of building on that, and the Democrats got their win I guess, and didn't try hard enough to defend it and build on it going forward. In the meantime, the GOP and Trump sabotaged the hell out of the ACA (removing risk corridors, reducing the tax penalty for the mandate to $0, etc...). Even after all that, and while living in a state that refused to participate, meaning the federal government is running the exchange, I was still able to get decent tax credits making my insurance affordable. The options are limited to almost nothing, because private insurance companies don't have the incentive they once had to participate in the exchanges. I'm now on Medicaid, only because my state's voters forced the GOP executive and legislature to expand it for adults (and they fought hard to prevent it even after voters approved it), and Medicaid ain't too bad. There were some initial delays to get going, but now I'm back on medications for free (no copays) and getting healthcare entirely free, including psychiatric evaluations, a visit to the cardiologist, and a colonoscopy coming up. The downside is the GOP is sabotaging Medicaid in my state too, reducing the payments that go to private practices, leading them to drop Medicaid, and funneling us all into a much smaller pool of health providers who still accept it.",0,2024-12-13T13:05:47Z,2024-12-13T13:05:47Z

@WeUs3638,"Let's be clear... just as there is ""lying through omission""... we need to add the term ""murder through omission"".¬†¬† One of Oxford's definitions of omission:¬† a failure to do something, especially something that one has a moral or legal obligation to do. 

When a¬† CEO commits murder through omission on a regular basis, there should be no gaslighting about social construct.¬† THEY BROKE THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCT.¬†¬† These shadow policies of ""deny"" and ""delay"" are intentional.¬† No low-level claims supervisor wakes up one day and decides to start denying ONE-THIRD of the claims that people paid a fortune for the peace of mind that they would be covered... only to find out when they are sick, in pain, could die, or all three... when they are at their most vulnerable... that they were scammed... maybe for years, maybe for decades.¬† And now their loved ones are freaking out watching them suffer, wondering how to pay the bills, what to do, feeling helpless, no recourse, all while their loved one is now dying and the claims are slow-rolled for a quick death.¬†¬† Corporate culture starts at the TOP.¬† 
ALWAYS.¬† 

Since the CEO did not meet the legal definition of murder... we need to re-evaluate our laws.¬† Why is it only ""fraud"" if you unfairly take people's money and then deny claims (and poor people have to prove it is a pattern) ?¬† If it results in death there should be liability.¬† But corporations require people to sign stacks of waivers basically saying they can do what they want... and since all the insurance companies require these waivers to be signed in order to get coverage... there are no options for people to look elsewhere.¬† Isn't that, alone, an anti-trust violation??¬† 

The people who want to clutch their pearls bc most (I am sensing) of us average folks are not losing sleep over this guy should meditate on that for awhile...
what it takes to decide that if you delay someone's cancer treatment they will die sooner and you will spend less and make more money...¬† That is as cold-blooded as it comes... 

Anyone reading this... I encourage you to search youtube for ""The Corporation full doc""... the original from 2004.¬† It is more relevant today than ever before.¬† Health insurance is barely turning 100 years old.¬† This whole private system is psychopathic... that is also the fascinating parallel drawn in the award-winning documentary.¬† The psychiatry ""bible"" ""DSM-5"" (Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5) has the official definition of a psychopath.¬† The doc goes point by point (in a very engaging way) on why the structure of a corporation fits that definition and so there is no other outcome than for corporations and their leaders to transform into the inhumane greed mongers we are now seeing.¬† If the original documentary ""The Corporation"" had been shown in every school in America, we might not be where we are now...",0,2024-12-12T18:21:11Z,2024-12-12T18:21:11Z

@lolaleslie66,"I've been saying exactly what they are saying for 20 years and it's a relief to hear people finally saying this stuff out loud. I had to declare bankruptcy 20 years ago after a hospital stay. I was ""fully insured"" by Blue Cross at the time.  I had nearly $500 dollars a month coming out of my paycheck between 1999 to 2004.  That was nearly 25% of my income at the time.  d

Yet, after being hospitalized for 2 weeks, I got nothing for it in return because Blue Cross bureaucrats decided the hospital stay was not necessary, so they weren't going to cover it. 

My life was literally in shambles after the bankruptcy and had to move back in with my parents at age 40. 

 Health insurance has to be one of the biggest scams ever.  I lost my faith in humanity at that time and have been struggling to get it back ever since.

I'm just so relieved everyone is finally talking about this.  People have been acting like it wasn't a problem, and this is where we are now.",18,2024-12-12T09:57:49Z,2024-12-12T09:57:49Z

@GrahamWhittaker-xo5uo,"Posting from the UK. I know we have different health systems, but this issue is universally a clash between classes. Like bankers, CEOs' don't concern themselves with the individual, they view this entirely within the capitalist framework; if that person, that human being is sick, injured, or whatever then s/he is not contributing to the economic viability of the institution, the asset's value diminishes to a point whereby s/he becomes a threat to the corporate wealthy and the shareholders.  They must thrive while countless human beings die. For the corporate and capitalist class in general, their logic is quite simple: if  the asset is no longer a profitable agent s/he must be jettisoned. Their is no consideration,.  Their is no empathy, and certainly no compassion,  or morality at play here,  because, as we know, capitlaism does not work on emotional constructs - only $ and ¬£.

@trevorxlindeman1798,"The system  of private for profit insurance companies and private for profit medical care existed long before Obama. So one cannot credit Obama for the system the US now has. 
BlueCross BlueShield started as a nonprofit insurance model in the 1930s. It as in the 1970s and 1980s that the for profit insurance companies decided to enter into the health insurance market and compete with the nonprofit BlueCross Blue Shield. prior to that BCBS accepted all people into one large pool. NOTE: The for profit companies offered group policies to employers at lower rates than the BCBS policies that offered insurance to all. Most refused to offer policies to individuals or if offered those with preexisting conditions were denied coverage. This skimming of younger healthy class of working individuals basically destroyed the large pool of all individuals causing BCBS to have to raise their premiums since their pool of clients now contained a larger portion of people with preexisting conditions who couldn‚Äôt get private for profit coverage. 
Remember, it was the ACA that placed a limit on the profits a health insurance company could make on the ACA policies at 20% with 80% of premiums going to patient care while the 20% was to be the management, advertisement, overhead and profits.

@ThomasDowning-ud6fz,"You mentioned the 44000 that die because of denied claims, which is a fuckin horror. 
  Imagine the number of people with chronic illnesses that are not dead but living in varying degrees of pain; from the somewhat innocuous like  asthma to debilitating pain from an accident where everyday is a living hell that either get denied the best care and are given just enough treatment to survive in a perpetual state of being someone's long term investment, i.e... they get rich off keeping you needing their sub par care for the long term. 
   I will give a direct example. In the USA they treat opioid addiction with agonists like methadone and Suboxone. You have to take those everyday to keep the withdrawals from driving you insane. This practice could be much improved on by prescribing a medication (the name is lost on me now) that takes  away your withdrawal pain and once through that initial withdrawal is no longer needed. That is to say that they won't go back in withdrawal again if they don't use and no further medicine is required. 
   Of course because they lose all that beautiful money by the fact people only need it once as opposed to everyday, the drug hasn't been approved for use in the USA.  It has been approved in most other places. Go figure.",0,2024-12-11T10:29:28Z,2024-12-11T10:31:50Z

I bet you can't and they won't release it. Now say no I said this which we do know the government tracks the internet. They'll just create a picture and you believe that's it. Did you see the guy's face when he shot this guy allegedly. So you can't even prove it was him. All you have is one snapshot from a f****** hotel. That wasn't even at the scene but the video camera and New York has video everywhere but only was able to catch her one image. and you believe all this b******* to be true? Where's the body the actual body of the CEO I want to see it. Because I don't believe either of those two men are dead Epstein or the CEO. I believe they just moved off and took their money and ran.

@roxann.,"We were paying $1500 a month (Florida) for a family of 3 no health conditions. (Average Florida cost is $600 per person)This insurance was through the hospital my husband worked at. They changed insurance companies and it went to $3k a month. He turned in his resignation to go work in another state for cheaper healthcare. He travels now which makes it harder on us. Wrap your mind around my husband literally has to leave the state he is in and his family because of medical insurance cost. And we are not even living with any kind of chronic diseases. 
I don‚Äôt even have a primary care physician because no one would take my $3k insurance. I would have to use the urgent care if I had a sinus infection because they would take my insurance. I had to have my obgyn do my yearly blood work.",14,2024-12-11T05:25:06Z,2024-12-11T05:25:06Z

@katepeterson7544,"Small rant: I have several chronic diseases‚Ä¶my meds, treatments and surgeries all require my physical and emotional time. But a HUGE chunk of my time (sometimes while I‚Äôm IN the hospital having treatment instead of binging some NF) is spent fighting with the insurance companies. I‚Äôm their worst nightmare and they are mine.  I typically get everything covered even if it‚Äôs through a years long appeal process that at times, turns me into a real bitch. They PLAN on patients giving up their appeals. 
The time that should be spent just living my life as a 46 year old woman, is instead eaten up trying to make sure I have a life in general terms. 
It‚Äôs insane. The United States is insane.

I pay $1200/mo for insurance and just got a letter that there will be a ‚Äúsubstantial increase in your premium for 2025.‚Äù This is the first year I‚Äôve never been given an exact dollar amount of what the increase will be so there‚Äôs no way to budget-
Nor have they ever used the descriptor  ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù to describe a cost increase. I think they‚Äôre sizing up how much they think I should have to pay them to be this sick.
I should mention that I‚Äôm a nurse, so because of my ability to navigate through this shit and ‚Äúmostly‚Äù understand it‚Ä¶I can get it done. I have no idea how anyone makes any headway at all advocating for their rights in a system that does its best to take them away. In a system that has set itself up to be so confusing and legally evasive that people don‚Äôt stand a chance. 
So yes‚Ä¶I spend my free time handling medical claims so I don‚Äôt go bankrupt. But to what end? Seriously. 
So my obituary can say, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt die with any medical debt, but she never really lived. Ain‚Äôt that some shit.‚Äù 

This is bullshit. All of it. That person that wrote in about their Humira costing them $3 on state insurance but upwards of $1k with their current plan?
I‚Äôm on a similar medication and have a similar situation.

@epaitech,"""If the government was the single insurer...you wouldn't have the person, the insurer, in the middle of the payment taking a cut""
While they wouldn't be 'taking a cut' you'd still have a government employee, rather than a private employee, deciding whether your procedure is covered and The whims of government, and what is covered, can change every 4 years.  That's potentially less stable.   I agree you need to take the profit motive out of healthcare, and other countries have versions of non-profit, private health insurance which might be more stable than leaving your coverage to the whim of the next governor or president.   The recent election has me worried about relying too much on government to protect me.  Possibly public/private  non-profit partnerships could work.",0,2024-12-11T02:00:58Z,2024-12-11T02:02:20Z

@A-Muslim-girl-from-Yemen.2,"My appeal to every Muslim, my brother or sister, the owner of the channel, I know that it is not my right to comment on your channel, but God is my witness that our circumstances are harsh and forced me to do this. Please forgive me. My brother, there is still a brotherhood of faith. I asked you for a bag of flour. My brother, we women cannot go out among men. There is still a woman with you. My brother, God has honored you. You are men. We are women. We cannot go out or work like you. My brother, where is the brotherhood of faith in your hearts? We are women. There is no brotherhood, no mercy, no compassion, no humanity. And give good tidings to the patient. It is the greatest hope while waiting for what we want.

Oh man, we are with you. My mother ordered us food from the restaurant. More and today. My mother left. Crying. She said, Why are you crying, my mother? She said, My daughter, I ask. God, that I may be honored by death. She said, Why, my mother.  She cursed us. She said, ""My daughter, today the restaurant owner insulted me. I said, 'Why?' I said, 'How can I be better than people?' I ask God, my daughter. May God gather me. With death alone, a gathering that is better than this humiliation and this humiliation. It is true. I am saying this. It diminishes my value and respect. But, man. I swear to God that I did not say this. I kiss your boots. I am so hungry that my conscience no longer allows me to let you go and ask us for food. I kiss your boots, man, and I ask you by God Almighty and in the Book of God, man, I kiss your boots, man.  He has caused us harm, my brother, so that we can buy a kilo of flour and pay the rent. My brother, have mercy on us. He who is in the show will have mercy on you, He who is in the sky. My brother, this is my WhatsApp number: 00967711500090. Whoever can help us, message me on WhatsApp. We will send him the full name. He will transfer us as much as he can. May Allah reward you. Allah knows that my family and I, our house rent is 20 thousand Yemeni riyals per month, and now we owe 60 thousand for 3 months. The owner of the house is one of those people who do not have mercy. By Allah, my brother, he comes every day and humiliates us and talks about us and wants to throw us out of the house and into the street because we were unable to pay him the rent. We will have until the end of the week, and if we pay him, he will swear by Allah that he will throw us out into the street without mercy. See my situation for yourselves. I ask you by Allah, the Living, the Eternal, to help me. By Allah, the Almighty, even at night we cannot sleep from fear. We do not have mattresses or blankets to warm ourselves from the cold. Everything is flooded from the rain, and we have no one but Allah and then you.  My brothers, I kiss your boots, don‚Äôt turn me away empty-handed. Help us with whatever you can. Is it acceptable to you that we live in this place? We are girls and we have no one. Our father died in a car accident. Consider us your daughters and your honor, and help me with whatever you can.
