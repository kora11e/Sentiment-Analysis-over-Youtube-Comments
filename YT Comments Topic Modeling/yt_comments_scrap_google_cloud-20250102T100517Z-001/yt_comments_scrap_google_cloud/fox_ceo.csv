The waiting lists can be horrendously long, but you WILL get treated for free and if your need is great, sooner than later.  Most jobs include some form of additional health insurance tho - likely because they get you back sooner lol - and that helps unload public hospitals. That said, I've waited literally all night in A&D while drunks kept arriving and being bumped ahead of me but if your need is great you get fixed up for free.",0,2024-12-11T04:48:39Z,2024-12-11T04:48:39Z

@rickshae2506,"The fact is Luigi got more balls and intellect than all these dimwit journalists combined. The question is not if a system should be privatized or socialized, but how it ought to operate. Privatized healthcare insurance is not evil if they don‚Äôt deny patient care for the sake of profit margin or place restrictions on which brand of medication to prescribe due to cost. That‚Äôs why everyone pays their insurance premiums month after month whether we use it or not because any of us might need it for rainy days. People don‚Äôt get sick and seek medical care out of the blue for fun or they are bored. The insurance industry is in for business profit over service and needs and that‚Äôs why many are pissed off.

@Andrewgeorge-z1w,With all due respect when you compare the American healthcare system to the system in Canada or Britain it‚Äôs not the same. I‚Äôve been being treated by the NHS and never had a real issue. Yes they are awaiting list but they have waiting list in America too. some of the best healthcare systems in the worldare a blend of private and public like in Australia so before you start going off on one perhaps you should do some due diligence. I would rather be treated even with its failings than treated in America like a second-class citizen because I don‚Äôt have health insurance will be left on the side of the road to die because I can‚Äôt afford an ambulance.,0,2024-12-11T02:02:30Z,2024-12-11T02:02:30Z

So if you have an issue with your benefits, take it up with your employer benefits people.
