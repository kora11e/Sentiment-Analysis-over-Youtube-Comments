@RogersGirl88,"Imagine if speed limits were allowed to be set by any person who is caught speeding. The cop pulls you over and says you were going 60 in a 55 zone. Wanting to avoid responsibility and a ticket, you say ‚ÄúI reserve my right to raise the speed limit to 60 on this street permanently.‚Äù The cop says ‚Äúokay, the limit has officially been changed to 60 on this street, have a nice day.‚Äù So a few weeks later you are on that same stretch of road and you see a guy zoom past you going 140 mph, lose control of his car, and smash into oncoming traffic, also traveling at 140 mph. You then realize that neither party was actually speeding, as the speed limit on that stretch of highway was legally 180 mph. You wonder how it could have been raised to such dangerous levels, unaware of the irony that you played an equal part in raising the limit to its current level. 

Liberals move the goal post of what is considered acceptable/demonized in society, but shy away from any responsibility when someone else uses that precedent against them. I wonder when these goal post-shifts will come full circle and you‚Äôll see things like a huge increase in court cases where black men (who as we know are ALWAYS altruistic, benevolent, and pure hearted) are defending against sexual harassment charges from women (who as we know are always honest, righteous, and true).

With that said it boggles my mind how anyone who vlaims they were constantly abused would want to spend time in court anywhere near their abuser quibbling over STUFF.

@nohillforahighstepper,"You cannot legislate the heart of man.  If you want the world to change, then you will have to change the heart.  There is only one way to accomplish that, that I am aware of....  GET BUTS BACK IN PEWS.  Regardless of the religion (Christian, Jewish, Islam, Buddist, etc), we were much better off when people recognized a higher power.  
Since we no longer recognize a higher power or deity, we have placed ourselves in the judgement seat of God.  When someone ""disses"" your god, that will generally illicit a fight response.  So, if I am my own god, anything derogatory against me is considered an afront to my god.   If you are seeing a severely negative response to derogatory speech from someone, that will generally lead to the fact that the person in question does not recognize or answer to a deity.
So, if you want to ""fix"" marriage, it is going to take considerable effort from ""missionaries"" to get people recognizing God.",0,2022-04-27T15:10:04Z,2022-04-27T15:10:04Z

@rispatha,"I was visiting a friend and we were chatting and doing our thing.  His GF came home and was already upset over something.  After her being home about 30 minutes she starts yelling at my friend over stupid stuff.  Next thing we both know she starts hitting him with her fists.  He just sits there and takes it.  Both were now yelling at each other and I went outside.  My friend was going to follow me out to get away from her and next thing I see is her with a cast iron frying pan hit him in the back of the head with it as he was walking out the door.

The cops were called because a neighbor had called them.  I gave them my information on what I had seen and witnessed firsthand.  She was standing there crying claiming that he hit her first.  Next thing that happens is he is put into handcuffs and charged with domestic violence.  It didn't matter what I had seen nor said to the cops they arrested him.  They basically railroaded him in the courts with a plea bargain and he still had to spend 90 days in jail.

He lost his job and she drained his bank account while he was in jail.  When he got out of jail she had also had another guy already moved into HIS apartment that he was paying for when he was not in jail.  She called the cops on him when he got to the apartment and said he no longer lived there even though the rental agreement had only his signature on it.  They arrested him again for a ""restraining order violation"" even though he didn't even touch her and just wanted to be in HIS apartment with her gone.

The mess continued for another 2 years even though he had spent time in jail and kept trying to get at least his personal belonging from the apartment.  Eventually he was able to get at least his cloths and his personal stuff but everything else she kept and she even continued to tell people that he was constantly hitting her even though everyone knew otherwise.  She even had her ""new man"" attempt to start a fight with him as well many times.  Once he finally had all of his stuff that he was able to get he moved to another location about 200 miles away.",0,2022-04-27T06:31:51Z,2022-04-27T06:31:51Z

Using recordings, testimonies, and whatnot to prove that Amber Heard was the abuser and Johnny Depp was the abusee, so to speak, is pointless.

What Depp's lawyers need to do is prove to the court that Depp's reputation was damaged by the words of the article itself, but they can't do it. The article never mentions Depp, it only vaguely says ""two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse"" referencing to the 2016 divorce where she accused him of public abuse and they settled out of court.

If Depp's reputation was hurt by the divorce itself, which was public news, or even if people interpreted the article in any creative way that's still not on her, it doesn't count as defamation because she never stated any falsehood in it.",0,2022-04-26T20:18:24Z,2022-04-26T20:18:24Z

@Daz0n,"What would make me consider marriage?

I think what would most likely make me consider marriage, or reconsider my current stance on marriage, would be two part. The first part being a Premarital agreement. While that may engender a sense of distrust, that distrust is *evidently* well-founded given every single statistic discussed in this very episode of Louder with Crowder. More than that, though, I like order, responsibility, and accountability. None of which is being represented fairly in family/marital court. A clear cut division of ""if we ever have to separate, not that I ever want to, this is the line drawn and what we owe each other.""

On a side note, even if it isn't entirely relevant, I want this one part of my stance to go unmistaken. If I propose, or I am proposed to, *the very last thing I will ever want to do is have that marriage fail.* I am a firm believer in love, making it work to the best of my ability, and the desire to see my life partner happy with our time together, whether it's the rest of our lives or anything shorter than that.

Getting back on the actual topic, my second point of contention would be reforming the court system and, to a lesser extent, the reformation of the current perspective of divorce in general. And it all really just stems back to this, the fact that men more often than not are perceived as ""Guilty until proven innocent"" instead of how it is *supposed* to be. ""Innocent until proven Guilty."" I've seen people close to me absolutely gutted from how heavily favored the court is to women in a heterosexual couple. How the male in the equation has to fight tooth and nail just for *visitation*, to *keep* that right even when the woman in question is a horrible, rotten human being that barely deserves the title.",0,2022-04-26T06:16:14Z,2022-04-26T06:16:14Z

@Collin4486,"The only role of government in marriage is to recognize it as a legal contract for mediation and tax purposes. That's all. The U.S. federal Constitution guarantees the right of free association and of contracts, and recognizing domestic partnership contracts is all the government should do. If two gay people want to get ""married"", the Constitution guarantees them that illusion of ""marriage""--but marriage is a religious institution, and government marriages have no standing in the eyes of God. No skin off His back if two confused people want to play make-believe in mockery of His institutions. They'll understand how wrong they were when they stand before Him for Judgement.

God gave us Agency to sort the wheat from the chaff, to refine silver into gold in the crucible of this test between good and evil. He already knows what everyone will do, but it's not justice to doll out rewards or punishments for things a person hasn't actually done yet, and God is JUSTICE! However, Lucifer's plan before falling was to FORCE everyone to be perfect and therefore gain all glory for himself with none of us actually learning or accomplishing anything for ourselves, which would defeat the purpose of this test. If two consenting adults want to live in confusion, it's wrong, but THAT'S UP TO THEM! Let them make their own mistakes and show them compassion, because they'll never reach the level of joy that following God brings, and He'll teach them the truth in the end. Those who choose good will be eternally rewarded, and those who choose evil will be punished in this life, throughout eternity, or both. God allows bad things to happen to good people because this life is just a brief test, a drop in the bucket compared to eternity, and all hurts suffered by the innocent will be wiped away by the Lord. All of this is just a dream compared to where we're going on this journey of spiritual evolution. Sometimes it can be a nightmare, but you'll wake up soon. Your body is just the receiver that your spirit is piloting, your meat is not the totality of your existence.",1,2022-04-26T00:18:26Z,2022-04-26T00:18:26Z
@RyanSmith6644,"This world is so twisted up and a knotted mess I don‚Äôt think anyone should get married until they can get their sanity checked. Nothing is going right in society at all and until people can get right with themselves everyone just needs to go to be alone to figure out themselves and what they need and be okay and love themselves before anyone can be well enough to be with anyone else. Too many people create themselves based around what someone else wants them to be and when it falls abort as most relationships that are insides often do it throws that person into turmoil because they don‚Äôt know who they are without someone telling them who to be and what to like. Then they loose so much time trying to repair that damage. It‚Äôs best to be whole within yourself before you get into a relationship that way you know what a healthy relationship should be. Too many young people are either too self absorbed or completely broken and only live for others happiness. Maybe schools should stop trying to indoctrinate kids into sexually and hating themselves but instead teach kids how to be healthy mentally and accepting of themselves and how to be a effective self sustaining adult. Teach kids what they need in this world for basic survival.

If you ask me I think the institution of marriage is at least in part under siege by adoption of homosexual behavior patterns by the rest of society.  In other words crazy is contagious.

@toxogandhi,"As a woman and a happy housewife, I would like to see marriage, as a legal term, or any term carrying the same meaning, abolished. I believe marriage should be a 100% religious institution.

As for disagreements when it comes to property, I believe attempts, perhaps with lawyers as messengers, should be made to the greatest ability to find compromise. If compromise cannot be found, onto the litigation process. However, in my ideal system, my tax dollars would go to paying more government workers to look at divorces case-by-case, and not to teaching Gender Studies in the Middle East, to establish what belongs to whom if the waters are muddy, as they would any two roommates in such a squabble. 

As for what a woman gets in a ""divorce"", my system is the same as I'd have it in the standing system: We get nothing but that what is best argued as belonging to us. My husband makes well into six figures annually. I'm a housewife who runs a mostly online business from home, so I'm still growing, only making around 30K gross annually, with prospects of paying myself at least what my dad made as a machinist, as opposed to ""Whatever is left"". Still, we have my money and his. We have an understanding that neither has control of the other's purse strings. He has loaned me money. I pay him back. He's watching my business grow, and I've helped him start a second one that's a joint venture in the recording industry. Some of the most talented people we could have found fell into our laps and the prospects there are looking incredible. Anyhow, we know how to separate money and love. We do share some things. We share some t-shirts, as we wear the same size. We have many of the same interests. Many things we buy ""for one another"" is as much for ourselves, but the result is the same. Not all tokens of affection we do grant one another, which mean more when they're unexpected and understood as not necessary as a part of the relationship to show love. With us understanding that we do not owe one another our labor, when gifts are given, it is a true token of love, as he is handing me his labor, his future health problems, hours and hours of his life. I was the one who proposed this rule and formed its boundaries, just as he was the one to bring up a dislike for pr0n in a relationship, something we share, though do not believe it should be banned. (If you can't tell, we're Objectivists. All of this is way more natural than it looks. I just know I have no right to tell him what to do with the fruits of his labor, and vice-versa. Really, it's that simple. As for our shared business, we know our roles and treat it as any founders would, dealing with our employees as befits our gifts, in separate areas of expertise. 

That said, I do believe that any group of two or more should be able to joint-file on taxes, simply because it makes fiscal sense. That's the closest to legal marriage of which I approve, one the whole cast of the Three's Company could get without anybody sleeping together.

This keeps the state away from that which is meant as a holy ceremony that, outside of extreme conditions (Cheating, assault, battery, etc.) should be a life-long pact, rather than an expectation after an unspecified period of time a man and a woman have been dating, oft times doomed before he even dirtied a perfectly good pants knee because marriage is just something people just abandon as things sit today; In my system, marriage bonds two souls before the eyes of God, rather than putting two souls in bonds by a Godless government, the same bonds that create these ugly divorces. 

The excess of divorces created by the state is, ironically, why family case workers become apathetic employees who, rather than consider a case slowly, weighing details with no bias, on an individual basis, choose to go by ""one size fits all"" rules, and make horrible mistakes. At best, they *only* leave men holding the bag, which is horrible, and I'm not condoning that at all, especially since my own brother is a prisoner to the custody system, married to a very abusive woman who does not even let him sleep in his home. He sleeps in a campgrounds, so I'm pretty fired up on this topic as of current, regardless the formality of my choice of diction (It's probably the Aspergers) Had she not dragged my poor brother far from my mother, his father, and me, I'd be of a mind to stage an intervention on my poor elder sibling, but the silicon-breasted harlot has isolated him, and he already lost a son to a nasty divorce, so he's frightened lose the four children he's had with this wife. Men should not have to pay, when the woman is statistically more likely to be the one to initiate the divorce. So, defining marriage as a religious decision, and cohabitancy, a usually fiscal decision, is good for everyone. It is more reverent of the church, something we need back, and it is makes marriage an agreement between a couple, not a couple and their hulking, all-powerful, abusive government. Everyone wins. As for privileges spouses have, such as the right to not speak against one another in court, their ordained minister who performed the ceremony need only testify or sign an agreement stating that he did as such. Governments need not know to whom we are married. That's what police that are members of their community who know those in it. I have a whole political system laid out, almost completely fleshed out, but I won't bore you all with the whole thing!",0,2022-04-25T11:48:11Z,2022-04-25T14:13:55Z

@Lolbert_Tarian,"I have not heard a single good argument that would justify all the cons that come with a legal marriage. Trust and loyalty are not absolute, so you never know if you will remain in a good relationship until death do you part. There is good in the ceremony as it allows both parties to make a commitment to each other without the legal contract that binds your finances together. 
Me being an atheist I have no problem getting married in a church, which is what my girl desires to happen. We can make a pact before her God and our families that we will love each other until death do us part, but I see no reason to link our finances together if we have already planned a life together and decided what we should focus our time, money, and effort on. I don't like the concept of the government being able to have some kind of influence on a couple's relationship.
Divorce is a reality for some and when the government has their hand in your relationship, the men seem to get the bad end of the deal because of it, especially if there are kids involved.
Marriage didn't always have a financial contract with the government before, so why does it need one now? Just seems pointless and detrimental if something goes bad in the relationship.",0,2022-04-25T03:50:01Z,2022-04-25T03:50:01Z

@jadenwillingham9845,"Question: What do you want to see change with marriage?
Answer: My generation grew up with a high divorce rate and as we know,  a absent parent and or problems in the home really do affect children. I‚Äôve seen multiple of friends growing up that had negative side effects due to their parents‚Äô relationship. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt get a divorce and in fact,  in my situation,  the best thing my mother could do was get a divorce. I just think we need to significantly decrease the divorce rate and abuse rate if we want our children to end up as good people. Sex Education needs to be better in our school systems as well. We don‚Äôt need to know about sexualities or genders,  we need to know about safe sex and the parts of genitalia. We need to learn how to spot toxic behavior in a partner and how to deal with abuse or manipulation appropriately. Teenagers (15-18) need to understand that actions have consequences and that men can be manipulated too. I am a woman and knowing that women have an easier time going through legal processes makes me feel terrible. The equality message has gone to the point to where women have more options than men do. I have a cousin who is a male. He was married to this woman who happened to have a bipolar disorder. They have a son together and at the time of the incident,  he was two years old. The mother had stopped taking her medication; something that was her responsibility. Because of her irresponsible behavior,  she put her son in danger. She claims it was due to her disorder but the two year old had to sit in the snow outside without a coat for two hours before his father came home. When my cousin questioned her,  she called the cops and claimed that he did it. He got arrested instead of her and instead of this woman going to jail she got to take her son out of town for months before the law enforcement had evidence against her. To this day,  my cousin got released but now he has to share custody with a woman who STILL won‚Äôt take her medication. If that isn‚Äôt wrong I don‚Äôt know what is.",0,2022-04-24T20:58:32Z,2022-04-24T20:58:32Z
@hideyourloveaway128,"My cousin was being abused by his ex wife. She would hit him and scream at him and he did nothing. Why? Because she had a son she‚Äôd had in high school and given to her parents to raise, who then came to live with them when they got married. He was trying to give this boy a chance. But the one time he threw up his arm to block a blow from her and her face came down on his hand because she was coming down on him with force, she cried to everyone who would listen that he gave her a black eye. She got her son so worked up believing she was a victim that when he was 14 he shot my cousin and killed him. That evil toxic narcissist woman should be in jail as accessory to murder. He was tried as an adult and sentenced to life without parole, but the Supreme Court did one of the stupidest things they‚Äôve ever done and demanded all child-as-adult cases be looked into again and resentenced. That means, even though he still was sentenced with the maximum penalty under the new law, that he‚Äôll be out when he‚Äôs in his 60‚Äôs and still easily a danger to my cousin‚Äôs bio daughters and their families, and his nieces and nephew and any children they have. ‚ÄúBelieve all women‚Äù has destroyed men in this nation and is one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice in the modern day.

2 years ago she ran from the cops under the influence and bailed on visitation, an ignored our daughter for 2 years , i filed for court dates when this happened an it was ignored until her lawyer filed 2 months ago , an i was found in contempt an made to pay her lawyer fees , 
An the new judge gov Holcomb put on the bench ,well her lawyer are friends they went to college together an have other ties what bs an theres more so he has to go !

an always has a lawyer, me i cant afford 1 anymore , so on the april 5th this is what my X did to our daughter this time , these were takin Monday when her arm was cast, she has multiple broken bones along with other injuries,  black eyes ect. , 
this is just 1 of many things my daughter has had to suffer threw , Noble co Indiana is going to get my daughter killed ! After supervised visitation was denied an a ppo theat was nvr even logged in , an idk why with all thats been documented, 
 it only took my X 48 hours to do this to our daughter  ,

@badhousewife6889,"Regarding Bra Sizing:
The number and letter refer to two separate measurements. The number is inches around the underbust (ribcage) and the letter corresponds to difference between the underbust measurement and overbust measurement (how much bigger around your chest is than your underbust)
It can get pretty complicated when you go into shape, fit, and sister sizes, but that's the basic concept of bra sizes",0,2022-04-24T16:43:13Z,2022-04-24T16:58:26Z

@Alex-mx3ic,"This trial is NOT about men‚Äôs rights and it is NOT about how a man can be accused of anything willy nilly - this has been a toxic relationship for years between two MEGASTAR CELEBRITIES with millions of dollars and lots of eyes on them.

The reason Johnny Depp is on trial is NOT because a man can be accused of anything, it‚Äôs about getting justice for all the abuse he‚Äôs had to endure. This trial is not going to land in Heard‚Äôs favor no matter how much you scare your audience and into believing so. 

The trial is at most a formality because there is so much to dig through. Just because Depp is a man doesn‚Äôt mean no one believes him, its the fact that Heard can afford good lawyers that can file motion after motion and stall him up in court. 

You really think a female murderer comes to trial and says: ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt me‚Äù and just because she‚Äôs a woman everyone believes her? You‚Äôre crazy.",0,2022-04-24T16:13:04Z,2022-04-24T16:13:04Z

@peteback,"Not saying I disagree with your conclusions, but you should be a little more careful with statistics. For example, you report that more women are given custody of children than men, but then you go on to report the raw numbers of child abuse from men vs women in these single-parent situations, without giving that as percentage. Not fair to make this comparison if there are more women raising children than men.",0,2022-04-24T15:59:44Z,2022-04-24T15:59:44Z

After Johnny Depp said Trump should be killed off.

And now, Depp confirmed he's not on board with the woke crap with the LGBTQ activism.  Bad time to side with conservatives, after how he sided with liberals for years against Trump.

Granted, I understand 90% of the people who side with the Woke Mob are actually not in support of the Woke Ideology but rather just terrified of getting cancelled or worse.

But Depp took it a step beyond just ""supporting Woke ideology"" he actively threatened the life of a sitting President in the name of Woke.

so.  To be perfectly frank.  I support Johnny.  But if he loses.  He gets what he deserves.
He's a grifter who sides with whoever supports him the most. He doesn't deserve anyones loyalty or respect.  And while I love him, think he's hilarious, and love listening to his testimony, the dude isn't genuine, isnt to be trusted. 

I dont think he beat Amber.
I don't like Amber.

He is on recording admitting to headbutting her (he says ""I fu.king headbutted you, that doesn't break a nose), he's on several records (made by his own accord) and under oath in the UK stating he cut his own finger off.  That means he is under oath lying.  After cutting his finger he wrote in blood with that finger all over the walls and on the mirror.  He wrote ""Billy Bob & Easy Amber""... because she just got back from making a moving with Billy Bob Thorton!  He's on recording stating he starts a lot of those fights when she's working and that it makes him crazy and jealous!

@davidrustylouis6818,"18:43 - That's one of the major problems for men in (especially) today's physical abuse issue; it's pretty difficult to *prove* a female is lying about accusations of abuse if there is/was a relationship, specifically a romantic one. When it's a guy's word against a female's word, the female tends to be universally given the benefit of the doubt. 

What that gold-digging parasite amber heard is doing is absolute evil, regardless of how one may feel about Depp.

When I was in college, I had a long-time girlfriend whose unwarranted jealousy got out of control. She eventually would begin throw heavy objects at me (she'd rather attack me from a distance - go figure), physically wounding me significantly. She'd do it because she knew I'd never hit her or hurt her (she didn't share my Christian faith, btw). One time we were arguing face to face (close) & while I was talking (not yelling but using an elevated, more forceful tone of voice), she hit me with a right cross in my open jaw as I was talking. That punch, which I was completely not expecting, hairline fractured my jaw & I didn't report it to the police (I wish I would have now).  

Another time, only a couple weeks later I was out having beers with my friends & came home after midnight & she woke up & began to beat me with one of those old 90's-style cordless land line phones, hitting me in the face & head (she was accusing me of cheating on her, which was bullshit). She called her parents on the same phone with which she was using to assault me & her parents called the police. Because I was the guy, (with obvious wounds on my face & head btw) & because I'd had several beers the police arrested me. I told the judge what happened & I wasn't convicted of anything but the whole thing just shows the lopsided bullshit societal view.

I know in hindsight I should have left at the first sign of her insecure violence & I did after that final incident involving the police. But it just shows that when you care for someone, that can develop an irrational mentality regarding their behavior toward you. Of course, I was young (barely 19) & thought I was ""in love"". This all happened in Atlanta in the early 2000's.

@CadetteKat,"I want to see marriage to be seen as a lifestyle change. We talk about diets, exercise, and other healthy habits as a life style change to ensure that it's healthy and effective. Why can't we see marriage as the same thing? Marriage in of itself is a big change, but that change doesn't just stop at the alter, it's a change and a process that continues to the end of your lives. People grow and change, but marriage needs to be about growing and changing together. None of us are the same person we were in our teens, twenties, and even thirties. We're different people as we age, and that's how it's meant to be. Marriage is about growing and changing together, being there for your spouse when things go wrong, when bad change happens, you grow out of it together. 

I don't think all marriages are good and upstanding, I don't support abuse in a relationship at all. If ANYONE, male or female is being beaten or sexually abused, I'll fight tooth and nail to get them away from their spouse. That being said, I think great change would happen in our country if everyone took on the mindset of ""my spouse will change, but I'm willing to change and grow with them so that we may be unified and fulfilled together.""",0,2022-04-23T13:40:28Z,2022-04-23T13:40:28Z

It's not just a social thing, biologically humans treat women better because of their inherent value as birth givers. And before someone chimes in with 'What about Islam/third world countries/old times when women were treated worse', you need to look at how they're treated in that society/era compared to their men. They always get treated better and have it better than the men. 

For as horrible as the Islamic world treats women, at the end of the day they're safe and taken care of, while the men give their entire lives to dangerous ventures. Women in the third world work, but not as hard as the men.

@matsuringo24,"Family court is in serious need of reform, it's basically a feminist sword wielded to punish men.

Prenups mean nothing anymore because the judge can simply deem the terms of the agreement 'too unreasonable' towards the woman and throw it out even though she agreed to those terms.

I personally saw the horror of it when my step dad got his life almost destroyed by his ex wife weaponizing his daughters against him by making a false abuse report.

I couldn't find a Christian guy who puts God first and he couldn't find the same in a woman. Well, I could find the guys, but I grew up with them and they kinda saw me as a sister and had no interest. We both went to our parents and suggested an arranged marriage when we were about 23. Our parents were best friends at his age and I grew up around his extended family (fairly close to them) but had never met him. Now, it's not an arranged marriage in the way most people think of it because we had the option to go forward or not. We were married a year and 7 days after we first communicated and have been married for a few months now. He is the best man God has ever made and even when we disagree I'm overwhelmed by just how much I love him. Our parents are Christians who raised us well and love us dearly, we put our lives into their hands and trusted them with their choice and we've TRULY never been happier. I love him with every fiber of my being and I know he loves me just as much.

@FirstLast-zv5od,"Got in an argument with my ex-wife once in the car, she punched me in the mouth and started laughing about it. I asked her why she thought it was ok and she basically said what the human turd said. Laughed at me and called me a baby. What was even worse was when I told my mother about it, she laughed too. She said that I am a man and can take it but would often say all men are sexist pigs. Took a lot of her anger out on me. She was and may still be incapable of owning up to her mistakes in life and instead blamed the men in her life. Granted, she did date a few fuck ups that were abusive towards her. Once walked in on one of them rearing back to punch her when I was probably seven. I can remember many nights trying to go to sleep listening to her screaming and yelling at whoever the hell she dated at the time. Anyways, I never laid my hands on that woman (ex-wife or mother) once. But she was violent. She once threw a cordless phone at my face, shit was pretty solid because it was not made in china. It was during a fight where she once again got violent as all fuck and I threatened to call the cops. She said call them and threw it at me. And she always played the victim. She was also a whore so...just not a good a person all around. Not a bad thing to have sex with people, but it is a bad thing when you have sex with men who are not your husband while you are married. No longer with that bitch. With a good woman who treats me with respect (although...she can be petty at times lol, i laugh it off later because it is just to annoy the shit out of me and is never anything I can't deal with). Tried telling my story to feminists on some stupid thread once, but of course the excuses came flooding in. ""Well...I bet you probably deserved it and hit her first,"" ""You are lying just to paint women as evil,"" blah blah blah blah. The truth is that they just want to hype the stereotypes. That no woman is capable of being a monster and that women are only victims. Shit...I was in college at one point doing some class where we had to do a group project and present some commercial. This one crew presented a commercial where it talked about domestic violence but only from the point of view of a woman. I and another student spoke up and recommended that they include men as victims. No shit every female in that class said it was more important that women stand up because men can take care of themselves and that it was a minority of men that go through domestic violence. Pitiful.

@DavidBainGaming,"My dad is also currently going through the shitshow that is the court system, here in New Zealand it is no better.

She filed claims of abuse, despite my dad having video proof of her abusing him, keeping him up all night with music/parties etc when he is a farmer and has to get up at sparrows fart every morning.

He showed evidence to police, called them on occasion, they said they can't do anything. She landed a protection order on him  with her false claims as they blindly believed her, and as a result the house he owns is no longer his, the only things that are regarded as his are his clothes, and the 7 rental properties he owns are also now in her name until the court proceedings are finalised.

He has tried everything he can think of and spent tens of thousands on lawyers but nothing has helped.

@goblinphreak2132,"Legal system is kinda broken. But that's where prenuptial agreements fit. I see a lot of people online throw in ""oh those don't hold up in court"" well there are many reasons why they wouldn't. One case I saw, BOTH PARTIES CHEATED. So the prenup didn't really apply. Both parties broke it! So the prenup was ignored. Another court case I saw, the prenup was never legally signed and witnessed. It was literally a piece of paper some dude had his wife sign. You absolutely have to have the paperwork signed, copied, one to each lawyer, one to husband one to the wife. And it has to be signed while witnessed by a notary. Just having your wife sign a random piece of paper doesn't hold up in court. Prenuptial agreements are generally legal as long as it's done right. People seem to always fuck it up and then pay the price. You don't see RICH people fucking up their prenuptial agreements. Because let's be honest, they have lawyers out the ass.

If women do not respect their husbands, perhaps as in the case of the trial of Johnny Depp, they are bound to be unhappy and act out, maybe even violently. I realize this is a complicated issue, but one way of making men more confident and women more appreciable of their husbands is to resurrect the traditional gender roles.

I had bruises from where she may have fractured something. it was all up my shoulder and upper back. the cop that took me to jail, said he would have taken her had he known, but didn't ever stop to ask, he just thought because I'm a big dude, thag I'm scary looking and deserved to go, and there was pictures that my mother took when I pulled my shirt off to go take a shower at her house, she asked what they was, I said I think that was when we was fighting and smashed my arm in the door. 

the cop did ask, why I didn't report it, and it was said that I didn't want to be embarrassed by being beaten by a woman, and I honestly didn't want to send her to jail, but maybe I should have? she now likes to use my kid as a weapon against me",0,2022-04-22T18:20:49Z,2022-04-22T18:20:49Z

@Crusader327,"These days, women are known to lie and use cheap tactics to take more of the man‚Äôs stuff in the divorce cause the court favors them.
They also know that they can get away with being physically violent to men, sometimes even in broad daylight.
Today, women are just as capable of getting a job and making money as a man, and can have just as prosperous careers. So why do we have to loose half our stuff? The assumptions by police that we are always at fault needs to stop, facts matter, and the court needs to make sure that our assets are just as protected as hers are, and the court needs to give people who falsely accuse others the same sentence that they would have bestowed on their accuser. This should, effectively stoping false rape and assault allegations, cause now the accuser has a chance of receiving that sentence if their lies are discovered. However, we need to realize that this won‚Äôt happen for a while yet and take precautions that protect ourselves.

Either get a prenup or don‚Äôt get married. Seriously, that needs to be a hard requirement, deal breaker, make it or break it. Even better, don‚Äôt get married on paper. I don‚Äôt recall exactly what this document is, but I‚Äôve heard that there is a way to start a family but have it be a business on paper which makes any divorce process much easier and fair cause it technically is a business, not a marriage. Date the girl for multiple years before you propose, cause it can take years to really find all the ugly details of a persons personality and beliefs. If you have children, DNA test them immediately, before you get attached. Even if your girl has given you no reason for you to not trust her and shown no red flags, women are naturally good at lying and manipulating and men are naturally a tad oblivious. You want to know for sure if that child is yours before you get attached and become financially responsible for another man‚Äôs child. Women can really screw a man over with the way the system works today, so we need to either take every precaution in the book, or just walk away and not get married. Dating is a whole awful game in its own rite these days and I‚Äôd suggest studying up on your red pill content before getting into that scene today.

@muffyscrazyworld2707,"I agree that marriage is ruined. the court should just make it do that if you get married and then choose to get divorced u leave with only what you brought in. so you will essentially go back to being single like u never got married. Kids would complicate it but ya for sure I think that we'd work.

I think any woman or man who lies about assault or violence they should be charged and do jail time. period.

They have a job like everyone else and the industry itself needs to fuckin chill on the incest vibes and what not but the industry outside of porn is very positive for people. Its extremely focused on consent and teaching people about it. There are many porn stars who make a rather good living and sure some that don't but thats also business you will have stars and not stars its quite easy.

@jillybeangaming,"the thing about drag queens is, at least with old school drag, it used to be about gay men paying homage to the powerful women who mean/meant the world to them growing up... everyone from their own moms and other female family members, to female superheroes, to female actresses.. but that was back when it was more just female impersonation. 

now drag is an umbrella term, and now you have trans women dressing up in female drag. you have trans men dressing in female drag, which you would think would trigger their gender dysphoria. you have straight men dressing in female drag to get in touch with their feminine side and have fun and perform. you have drag kings (females dressing up like males).. and you have like gender f**k drag, like with bearded queens and androgynous drag (often times feminine clothing, but sometimes no tuck, and often times no breast plate).. 

personally, I love old school drag, female impersonation. that's just a fun, entertainment genre for adults... but it's hyper sexual and NOT FOR CHILDREN.",0,2022-04-22T17:19:45Z,2022-04-22T17:21:16Z

I think on the womens side we need to wait longer, I think we need to be picky but in the way that you genuinely listen to your body and mind. Are you attracted to this person physically and mentally? Or is he just there. Same for men. I think we need to communicate more with one another about what we want in partnership as well. Like actually talk not just like ‚Äúhe needs to be 6 feet tall and make this much money‚Äù. I almost wish that the church would separate from state so you could get married in the eyes of god but it literally does nothing law wise other than hospital scenarios.

@JP-ht5vgh,"I think the problem with marriage is personal responsibility and just plain bad teaching. 
You don't marry someone because they're ""fun"" to be around, you don't marry someone because they're cute, or because you are head over wheels in love with especially if those feelings aren't reciprocated. 
People need to learn to find life partners. And no, it doesn't always always work, it's not a 100% chance it will work. However, you gotta put more brain into the matter. The whole follow your heart is BS, don't follow your heart just because you don't feel the same everyday. Follow your brain, logic.
Is this a good person, is this person a good son or daughter to their parents, is this a respectful person, is he/she responsible, hard working, does he/she have good feelings, how do they treat others? What bad habits do they have, will I be able to live with this person's defects the rest of my life or is it something you truly can't stand? Is this person caring, loving, compassionate.
Stuff like that. and take your time to get to know them, don't rush to the altar if you haven't analyzed this person well. You will have a better chance at a life long relationship and a happy marriage.",0,2022-04-22T16:11:28Z,2022-04-22T16:11:28Z

Chased all my friends away, got a hold of my bank account & ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù my finances. Gave me a $20 allowance per month out of my profits from my personal training business that I worked to build up for 2 years already but then chased my clients away only to gaslight me that I wasn‚Äôt pulling my weight & cheated on me! I left 8 times only to be talked back and I was trying to make it work( my fault!). She attacked me viciously on my way out for the 9th and final time. Striking me 6-8 times with closed fists about the head & face. Broke my nose! When she hit me in the nose it automatically caused me to reach out. She ended up in a rear naked choke hold out of desperation not malicious intent. As the stars cleared out of my eyes, I realized what was going on(I‚Äôm a disabled Veteran, 100% PTSD)I let go immediately and ran out the house. All the cops needed was me admitting that I put her in the hold. It didn‚Äôt matter that I was black & blue. No self defense was mentioned in the police report & the news broadcast my mug shot with only her narrative was stated. I got charged with a felony strangulation & suffocation and the cop was fishing for attempted murder! For a 5 second hold!! I had no $$& to bail out, they cut me off my medication immediately & didn‚Äôt replace them for a month & I was facing 6 years of incarceration. So, I tapped out, took the plea and got 18 months incarceration in state prison plus two years probation which ends April 30th. I rebuilt my life but my reputation is forever tarnished.

@doglover1001000,"My Fianc√© and I believe that marriage shouldn't be a legal institution.

We believe that our wedding will be a religious ceremony and should be treated as such, and we also believe that our marriage should be centered around Christ. I think that if your marriage is built on something as concrete as Christ, then the issues that are stopping people (specifically men) from wanting to get married won't be present in the marriage. My Fianc√© and I would never falsely accuse the other of abuse, and we definitely would never abuse each other, because a Christ-centered marriage is all about love, respect, sacrifice, and leading each other to Christ.

@BeWise4Life,"This one hits a little to close to home for me. I went through this myself. To this day she still can't see what she did. 

It took years and $45,000 in lawyers fees to not only get a DV case dismissed but get custody of my daughter up to 50/50.
Under the same scenario, a woman would have easily been granted full custody of a child under California law. The worst part is that the court system I went through was more ""Progressive"" in father's rights than many others across the country. 

Even then, the disparity for men's rights and women's rights in our country is astounding. 

Women like this aren't content to let you break up and move on. No, this is part of their identity. Without the identity as a victim they are nothing. Most have played this role their whole lives in one context or another.  Sad to say, but many, just like make abusers, had a screwed up childhood.

What I want through, she wasn't just content to separate. She wanted to distance my friends and family, ruin my career, and take my child. As they pointed out, it has taken me years to undo the damage she did to my reputation and I still can't change the minds of the ""once an absurd always an abuser"" types who don't care about facts. 

I was the one recording everything and wearing body cameras to every interaction....it is a scary place to be. Men's power is typically in their hands while women's power is typically in their words. We have emasculated the physical power of men in our courts and elevated the verbal power of women. 
A woman who uses her words to abuse is just as damaging  as a man using his physique. 

Also, as Crowder points out, women hitting men is quite common. We are just still under the influence of the old adage ""You don't hit a woman, even when she hits you"" or else you're weak and less of a man. An equivalent retort would be that a woman shouldn't demean or character assassinate a man, even if does to her, or else she is weak and less of a woman. 

While there is some inherent truth to these concepts in relation to gendered power differences, we need to have an equivalent standard across the board - especially in our legal system.",75,2022-04-22T12:37:13Z,2022-04-22T12:37:13Z

She didn‚Äôt have a single mark on her while I had a 2 inch 8 stitch gnarly scar on my forehead.   All a woman has to say is that you hit her regardless if she has any injuries or marks and you will be arrested.   THEN the DA dropped the charges against her for her cooperation against me.  They offered me a plea thinking I‚Äôd take it but I was willing to go to trial and fight it knowing I did nothing wrong and they eventually dropped the charges knowing they couldn‚Äôt win the trial when my lawyer put our arrest pics up side by side.

Fast forward to when we went for custody of my daughter the court wanted the proof (a police report) for every instance that I brought up to why the bi-polar woman who refuses to work for a living shouldn't have full custody of my daughter of course I'm in Missouri and they gave us 50/50 yet I paid $450 a month in support while she still got to live with her mom and not work.

I had been dating one in my early 20s I had been considering proposing to, and then found out she had been cheating on me for more than a month. 
At a similar time a close friend of mine had been accused of sexual assault by a girl out of jealousy because he wasn't spending enough time with her the previous week. She hadn't been paying close enough attention though, because the reason he hadn't been spending time with her (and why the accusations went no where but minor reputation) was because the reason he hadn't spent time with her was because he was back and forth between the hospital and agonizing bedrest, for a combination of kidney stones and chronic joint disorders..

@I3uddzo,"~Lengthy Post

I'm coming up on my 25th here in a few months, for nearly my entire childhood and adolescents I always envisioned myself as a loving father, happily married, picket fence house with two or three kid, nieve childhood dream.

But then I started dating around 16, I have been cheated on in nearly every relationship. (For transparency I myself have done so once, still regret it to this day.)

I've been assaulted by at least three or four of my exs, and one was sexual in nature, I was passing out drunk on my own couch and woke to being straddled and a tounge rammed down my throat, context aside just switch the roles for a second.. 

Between divorce, and the way in which most women around my age seem to be completely against the idea of marriage I can't help but just let that childhood dream die.

@AreWeGaming.,"People don't understand what's happening in the world. They think its just, ""We need to have Equality"" but really its being forced. Being a Christian everything in the bible says this is wrong and shouldn't do it but they said what's the harm in it. Now since they expect you to accept them, they don't have to accept you. Simply Your View is wrong if its against anything they Believe in or their Views. Since this is being shoved down our throats and you cant go any where without seeing something about accepting Homosexuality. I stop and think Will Babies become Extinct? They push more Homosexuality over just equality or just doing you. You support Homosexuality that's your problem, So why force it upon the world. The Bible does say ""Satan will take everything that is Wrong and Make it Right, Right is Wrong"" (Take's everything, Flips it Upside Down and Turns it Around). Also to talk about the rest of the video, Who cares what is happening to these Actors (Famous) Stuff like this happens to people around the world on the daily but since its someone of Credit (pedestal) They need all the attention because that's more important than what's happening around you in your Life, your world. Food Shortage, Gas Prices to make people go Broke, People becoming more dependent on the Government. Who cares about Elon Musk, is he helping you with your bills, expenses or is he wanting to go to Mars for no reason but really its to rub his fortune in peoples faces and you still buy his Cars. (Elon Musk has 10% Twitter $47 a share 800,641,166 (Amount of Twitter Shares) - 10% = 80,064,116 x 47 = 3,763,013,452 (3.7 Billion) and that's what he has currently in Current Price) He could save this planet if he wanted to, Literally How many jobs he could create, products, water treatments, Food pretty much anything that could benefit the world.

@stephen202G,"Cons significantly outweigh the pros thanks to the government getting involved. The only benefit you get is your taxes being at a higher threshold. While you risk alimony payments, getting half your stuff taken from you, including pre-marriage stuff even with a prenup because the judge can choose to disregard it, and your spouse can then hold your kids hostage from you. Men on average always take the harder hit from the court system, add that to society's mentality that men are guilty until proven innocent. Why would a man want to subject themselves to these risks, especially when people's mentality has become one where an arbitrary reason is acceptable to jump straight to divorce, so they can ""secure that bag, queen"".

@nilarene2088,"Comment of the Day: 
My opinion is that if you truly want to see a change in ""keeping the sanctity of marriage"" the only way, is through people respecting the Glory to God! The world has fallen apart because way too many people have lost, and most refuse to glorify our Creator. Pretending to dismiss the greatest gift of each other as our neighbor, children of God, people have lost the true meaning of our very purpose and existence.

@adrianjames191,"Steven Crowder, why are you wasting our time talking about this BS when there are so many other more important issues to discuss?

You say Johnny Depp is standing up for men's rights? That's BS. Johnny Depp cares about one thing, and that's Johnny Depp. 

Actually, there is something else that he cares about --- getting convicted child murderers out of prison and then getting matching tattoos with them, and supporting them on book and speaking tours. He does care about that.

I'm sure Amber Heard is a woke POS. But so is Johnny Depp. I'm surprised you haven't looked more into JD's background before you took his side on this issue. 

I cannot support someone who supports child murderers. You've lost a subscriber. Buh-bye.",0,2022-04-22T05:57:01Z,2022-04-22T05:57:01Z

@TheRealAkaRai,"I'm gonna make a really radical suggestion that every time I bring up people both right and left seem really uncomfortable with: Polygamy. Okay, hear me out. We can't just wipe away courts implicit bias towards women, millions of years of evolution and neotenous features make it easier to side with and empathize with them, but that's wiped off the board if the guy has two wives. What if the one wanting a divorce claims he hit her, but the other wife says she's full of it? Conversely, if both wives divorce him, he's royally screwed. In considering the welfare of the children they're more likely to be left in the stable environment with the remaining two parents. They wouldn't find it weird the kids being raised by a stepfather/mother, so how could they take issue remaining where they already live? I'm not talking about cults or child brides, there have been series about families practicing polygamy, they tend to be financially successful and deeply religious. Besides, there are already numerous poly""amorous"" groups who are living together and sleeping together but because they're not  married not only is that totally legal but there are articles celebrating it. If it's happening anyway, why not incentivize commitment? It's fine if it's the same for  both genders, because a wife with five husbands can only get pregnant by one at a time, but a guy with five wives can father five children at a time. Plus we've all heard the bellyaching about what a nightmare modern dating is. Women in the west have been taught to be very mercenary in relationships, way too many see OnlyFans as a feasible career path. Guys might be more willing to commit to shall we say, lower quality of women if in return they can do so with a greater quantity of them. Look, you can be mad at the idea because ""boo-hoo my western values"" but it's already happening just without commitment. Plus, every single woman on Earth claims to be bisexual these days, if they're not full of it they should be excited at the prospect.

Beyond that, no more alimony. We don't live in a society where 100% stay at home parents are terribly common anymore, unfortunately. We can make exceptions in those cases, but if both have jobs there is exactly zero reason the man should have to give up his house, half of his earnings and half his salary for years just for having a Y chromosome.",0,2022-04-22T05:28:29Z,2022-04-22T05:28:29Z

@borealliving5859,"Nice show! I agree with most of it, except for the prenup part. I mean, I don't think it would solve anything, I think it would actually be very hurtful to the family unit to have an automatic prenup before getting married.

I mean, why would a woman be a SAHM if she has no security? Is the problem the way the system is, or the way people get married?

Because I would not be SAHM if I could end up loosing everything in case of a break up. Or worse: if I was a SAHM in a violent relationship, I would not be able to leave because I would end up on the street or working minimum wage for the rest of my life.

And the truth is, you say she benefits from breaking it up ... but no. She will still be richer with him than without him, even if she has 50% of everything.

And on the other side, any man could marry, have children, convince his wife to be a SAHM and after 10-15 years, when kids are not much of a burden anymore, that all the expensive costs for kindergarten etc. gone, that his wife is now unattractive, he could divorce her, pile everything he saved/she made him save over the years and just leave her in the dirt and start a new life, rich as hell with no kids, free as a bird.

I mean, I don't have a solution to this, but ""not sharing anything"" is not one to me.",0,2022-04-22T02:47:30Z,2022-04-22T02:47:30Z

Women are strong capable, getting better educated than men but can choose to stay home and are not held in the same contempt as a man would be - think about how tough a modern stay at home housewife has it - load the dishwasher, load the washing machine, stay out of the way of the Roomba, be home for the weekly grocery delivery, maybe prepare one or two meals a day for the partner, a bit of light dusting - I could knock that over before 10am and she can then complain that hubby ""isn't doing his share of the domestic duties"" and make him unload the dishwasher and washing machine when he gets home from work.
 After a couple of years of this, she can cheat on him and take 80% of everything a man has in the divorce.

@SanctusDemonus,"from a a 29 year old man in this day and age i can say the reason i dont even get involved in many realtion ships at all isbecause some girl could be having a bad month and wanna fuck some dude over and go out on a power trip, can decide hey i got this new dude in my life who doesnt mean much yet, lets feel powerful and cunty by saying he raped me or hit me or just isnt nice. bitches talk. social media doesnt help. 99 percent of girls are living two lives. their social media life and their real life. and they are almost always different. idk if just girls do this. i dontdate men so i dont notice. i dont own a facebook to clearly stand for how against it i am, and yeah im a guy i love sex, haha. but nothing is worth my life and freedom because some bitch had a bad day or of i dump her. or do somthing she desont like. she can just fuck me over for life. and for any men with any type of trouble with cops. even if its nothing dangerous. your word means even less when in front of police or a judge unless the female is far worse than u. its just a fucked system with no hope. every girl i know will ""trade up"" and bend the fuck over like a slut in a heart beat if they think the dude is a better deal. no care for how to properly do this. no faith. no nothing. cunts are cunts. good women are 1 in a million maybe less.",1,2022-04-22T02:01:42Z,2022-04-22T02:01:42Z

1. Title 4D needs to be rid of. 
2. Family courts need to be turned to rubble or maybe homeless shelters. 
3. Live feed into court rooms for hearings.
4. No more Qualified imunity. ( Family services cannot be sued)
5. Purgery needs to be enforced in the court rooms.
6. Lawyers. ( I do not think I am supposed to say tar and feathered), so consequences for encouraging things like false accusations to Alienate Fathers from their children. 
7. Automatic 50/50 in regards to children. 
I am aware that this is all post Maraige, but people are finally seeing in front of their own faces what happens to men who get married and that Sir, is why only 6.5 out of 1000 men are getting married although I would bet it is less.
I will also add in regards to the stunning and brave single Mom's that as the ladies start making the most money and get higher positions they will start taking all of your money and alienating you from your children.

@charlesii4830,I was in a relationship where the woman hit me. As soon as she hit me. I threw her stuff out on the street and changed the locks. She got her mother to come over to my house to convince me to let her back. I told the mother. Her and her daughter are freaking crazy. Then the woman lashed out and pushed me. So! I slept her mama across the face doctor in the dirt. They asked me why I slapped her mom. I replied! It‚Äôs her mothers fault that she is that way and if her father was here I‚Äôd punch him in the face too. It is their fault that their daughter grew up to be a lowlife reprobate with a drinking problem and a short temper. The circle was complete. Six months later I met up with her dad in the bar. He was talking a lot of stuff and asked me to go outside. I obliged him and went outside. As soon as we went outside I cracked him across the face and knocked his dick in the dirt. Then I told him he was a reprobate drunk and it was his fault that his daughter is a crazy. So I hit him again and again. MEN!! REMEMBER!! A man or a woman that does not take care of their family especially the family in their own house is an infidel and deserving of death. God of the Bible says that you are an infidel if you don‚Äôt take care of your children and provide and protect them. Worse than a murderer.,0,2022-04-22T01:48:55Z,2022-04-22T01:48:55Z

  On the first day before the trial started, I was offered to have the trial done in Veteran's Court where I would receive a much lighter sentence such as lesser fines, no prison time, only probation, shorter mandatory DV classes and record expunged upon completion of the sentence  if I would plead guilty.

How would Future put this, Crowder?!?
""She's for the streets!""

There are *very* few wives being made anymore. No LTR's, no cohabitation, and no marriage until ""no fault"" is overturned and children go to the fathers...

Men won't ""pull the trigger"" as they do now knowing this could be the result, making the decisions heavier will do that. Women won't be able to *gut men and consider it a come-up*, especially when they may be on the hook for child support.
Everything is bass-ackwards now anyhow; time to balance this bullshit. Or not! Men are going their own way to save themselves due to femmunists and poisoned upbringing. If they won't listen to the buyers on the market, ""buy a dog and die alone"" as Kevin Samuels says.

Also, as a woman who has experienced abuse from a father and a professor abuse only goes one way.

@americanrefugee5967,"Thank you guys for your courage in speaking out about this. 

I recently wrote the following about how insulting this garbage is to us actual women.  

I can not stay silent about this anymore! I am a proud conservative and Truth seeking, women. An actual equal Rights, equal opportunity pro life, pro human conservative. My views have not changed over the last 20 years. I did not change and I will keep telling the Truth! 

I am infuriated and disappointed that people refuse to stand up for women‚Äôs Rights!! Our actual Women and Girl Rights are being threatened by cowardice and especially cowardly men who are actively taking opportunity and rights from real women and girls. 

A man who doesn‚Äôt want to take responsibility for himself, slaps on a wig or grows his hair long and puts on clown makeup, takes estrogen and forces others to lie and accept his lie is a coward, not a woman. It does not make him a woman. 

That man can never understand that I did not get stretch marks and obesity from laziness and cowardice. 

I earned it, my being a woman and having children. Not by what these people claim makes a women, by killing babies they can never have and dodging any kind of pain or responsibility by claiming his ‚Äúbest life now for me‚Äù! 

I am an actual woman who chose to courageously step up, accept permanent body disfigurement, giving birth to two healthy and beautiful kids. 

No man has ever ran hours of track or cheerleading practice with menstrual cramps, worrying about bleeding through their pants or desperately trying to lose the baby weight. Not one! 

No man has made that decision feeling the baby inside kick with life knowing his life will never be the same! 

No man has ever felt that close to death and God while pushing life out of their own bodies! 

A man putting on make up, taking estrogen and calling himself something he can never understand, much less be, does not make him a woman!

If these men claiming to be women, continue to choose to be a hypocrite and coward because they refuse to step up to actual responsibility and call out the liars then they are as ridiculous and terrible as I have feared. 

 A ‚Äúsuper smart‚Äù young man I know  recently screamed at me claiming I hate transgender people because I would not emphatically agree with this delusion. He went on saying how he and his generation is so much better than his mom because he states proudly that he was programmed by computers and the internet his whole life!! Seriously he said that!

Then I would suppose he would like his doctor to guess on which labs to do, which scans and tests to order, which catheter to use, or any of the other number of gender specific lifesaving medical treatment needed to save their life in an emergency? Should they exclude these important medical facts while saving him or his no sex/ no gendered friends? 

These people insult me every day by how easily they have been brainwashed. Denying physiological facts and hating their parents for not sharing their delusion.

And by the way, only rich, ignorant people are worried about Ukraine. 

Actual Americans are worried about their own country and our own borders. 

Only the rich have the money and luxury to be so wrong......

I would do almost anything for my kids love but I won‚Äôt be a liar for their comfort. I won‚Äôt do that. 

I won‚Äôt accept the lie. They may hate me for it and consider me ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù for perceived thought crimes. 

But someday soon when they want the truth they will remember that we don‚Äôt lie, comply or participate in delusions just to make other people happy. The value of this cannot be overstated. 

It can be hard to stay strong, stand for Truth and be faithful in such Godless times. But people need to have the courage to speak out, to speak up for Truth while we still can.",3,2022-04-22T01:06:52Z,2022-04-22T01:06:52Z

@ValorWarrior5258,"What needs to be done to make the institution of marriage better:
Love and Respect for one another is a great start. Instead of ‚Äú fighting/arguing, sit down and talk about what each of your imperfections and annoyances are and respect the other person as they tell you what you may not want to hear, and then work together to come to a place where your relationship is strengthened, not deteriorated by calling names and laying blame. Last and most importantly: You have to be best friends. You have to communicate with one another just as you did in those first days that you were getting to know and first dating. If holding each other‚Äôs hands and your loved ones touch still gives you those butterflies, you are on the right path!
Communication is the biggest key!
My husband and I have been together for 30 years, married for 28 years, and we still share those intimate little handholds, kisses and feelings of love that we had in the early years. Love lasts longer when you speak to one another respectfully! We are proof of that!
My husband has always said that his worst thing he experienced around male co-workers were the derogatory words men used about their wives, he said‚Äù If I don‚Äôt have anything good to say about you, or express about how much I love you, then I wouldn‚Äôt say anything!‚Äù‚Ä¶ that to me is a real man.. and this goes both ways, women do not need to gossip and talk down about their husbands among other women. Control who you are friends with, and what you say when with those friends, this helps keep resentment of each other from playing a part in your friendship/ relationship and drastically can improve your intimate lives together! A husband and wife should love each other and treat one another as they are one person, made whole by their spouse!",0,2022-04-22T00:57:13Z,2022-04-22T00:57:13Z

@RandomNickCanada,"I understand a fraction of what Johnny went threw. To be honest, my first-ever girlfriend took me for granted. She got a free roof over her head, help to get into a small hair salon school, food, and a caring, working boyfriend who drove her to and from school, cooked for her and dealt with all of her (honestly very obvious and outrageous in hindsight but I was blind by a naive feeling I thought was love) red flags.

In the end, I got a better paying job to help support her that was a week in week out, remote job, my parents message me saying they saw her making out with some random dude, she'd dropped out of the school I helped her get into, used the grocery money I left her with for pizza and drugs, both to share with her mom who visited specifically while I was away so that she could introduce her to her new boyfriend, and she (who was jobless and never once looked for a job unless I brought her out) adopted a kitten, which she already had a cat she could barely care for and I had just driven almost 20 hours straight to get rid of the dog she couldn't care for or control that made a mess of my apartment.

I had driven straight for my new remote work to home (got there at 3am) to find her on the doorstep crying in pain because her NEW boyfriend, which she so proudly announced in a nonchalant manner, was being so carefree on their Threewheeler ride down dirt roads that when he suddenly hit the breaks, she went flying into a tree. Calmly, I told her I could take her to the hospital then and there (I was planning on dropping her off and GTFO) but she wanted her new boyfriend...'s mom >.> because he didn't have a license or his own car... to drive her there and they were already on the way.

I was so frustrated and exhausted that for the first 5 hours they were at the hospital, I went, fed her fucking cats because I pitied them more than I did her, cried in my bed, put one of my mattresses against the wall to punch it, then went to see my parents. Cried for another hour then texted her; ""Get your parents and whoever else to get your shit out of my home. I'm sick of being your fallback plan and protector. My whole family has warned me, even some of your family warned me. But I was too stupid to listen. Get the fuck out of my house and my life.""

two years later, my mom saw her at the hospital, roughly 6 to 8 months pregnant. When I ask one of her family members I was on good terms with, they said she'd been with a bunch of guys around then, but the last one left her because they'd yet to go that far. The dad was an unknown. Of course, this moment in itself was years ago. I'm glad I'll never see her or her family ever again.",0,2022-04-22T00:51:25Z,2022-04-22T00:55:56Z

@trishlarocca,"This is so sad. Unfortunately I've been on both sides of this situation.  When I was younger I was violent and abusive. Drugs and alcohol didn't help. We split up and I got with an abuser.  I stayed, mostly out of guilt for what I had done. Thankfully I was able to get some help. Abuse is a horrible mindset to leave. I will always feel bad for what I put a good man through. My life could never stand the scrutiny that his is right now. Men get a raw deal. 100%",49,2022-04-22T00:16:44Z,2022-04-22T00:16:44Z

@EquaODaLv,"Easy solution to the marriage issue. Grant the marriage issuing institution authority and responsibility to adjudicate divorces for marriages they perform. If you have a faith based marriage from your religious institution of choice, they adjudicate. If you choose a state based marriage, the state adjudicates. Less cases for the state, more authority to the religious institutions, more separation of church and state, more freedom of choice for the marrying couples.

If the other statistic is that legally women get possession of the children in most divorce cases or custody battles then women abusing children more would be the expected outcome of women spending a TON more time with the children if not all the time. Women abusing men more often does not have that problem. You would have to do a side-by-side comparison of fathers and mothers with children with equal time and see which is more. I assume based on the other statistics that it would still be higher for women, but not as gigantic of a difference as you mentioned +/- 100,000.",0,2022-04-21T23:47:22Z,2022-04-21T23:47:22Z

@jeremyalvarado7517,I'm not sure what the situation is about restraining orders but they should be a lot easier to get so in case you want to break up with the person and you know they're crazy you can have the restraining order and yeah they can violate it but at least you'll be able to get a cop out there to take them away once they do violate the restraining order that's if you are in a relationship where the other person is shity and you want to break up,0,2022-04-21T23:43:21Z,2022-04-21T23:43:21Z

@ladynotricks1232,"You make a good point, on multiple cases.
 As a female survivor myself I liked the goal of the MeToo movement, but hated those that came on with fake stories undermining the whole purpose. You could tell by the story, body language, and tone who had actually suffered and survived through such ordeals, but at the same time you could tell those who were just trying to use it to slingshot themselves into the limelight as they saw it and get ahead. It sickened me and I was furious at the same time. Also, i don't know why guys get ignored, maybe me and my other female cousin wouldn't have been victims if our oldest cousin, who I only found out years later was also sexually assaulted, if my family had actually done something about it and seen to getting him help. Yet he was ignored, passed around by family like a black sheep and became a perpetrator. Probably because as I found out you mentally get f***ed up trying to figure out why it happened to you and what it means to love those around you in different ways and your logic doesn't always arrive at the correct window.
As for female violence, never really thought about it until you said it, but growing up my father was a victim of violence. Us children too, until my Mom realized we flinched every time she walked behind use, due to her ""little love tap"". My Dad has already been beaten into submission and she doesn't do it as far as I'm aware anymore, but he just let's things happen to him now. He never hit her, but I remember her hitting him. Yeah he had alcoholic problems, but so did she.
As a female I don't trust other females, not just cause of my mother. Most of my interactions with other females has left a bad taste in my mouth. Bat shit crazy, catty, and untrustworthy as all get out. Most have only sharpened their claws so they can stab you in the back at a moments notice when it suits them. I don't have female friends anymore.
I tell other, ""All females have a little crazy in them, some more than other.""

Im a police officer, can you open the door? comes from outside
I ask my i open the door now?
As i get up to reach for the door, she get up and blocks it..
I yell thru the door, i cant open the door shes blocking it!!!
Cop yells, open the door or i will break it down!
She opens the door and i leave
I put myself in psycho ward just to get away from her. Told them only the police are allowed to visit. 3 days in she visits, i told her it was over and that it was her and that she needed to leave me alone. She flipped out like the crazy bitch zhe was..
At group later they asked me who she was, i flipped out and told them she was the reason i was in here, to get away from her. And even after i said ONLY police can visit me, you flucking allowed that crazy bitch in!!!!!
Funny story 
She kept calling the police on me for bullshit.
1 time she called and said i was buying pot from a police officer.
Srg and lt show up ant my location, completely search me my stuff and my car (i allowed it). Didnt find any pot. Ask me questions about who would make something up like this. I gave him my ex's address and fone number. He called 911 and asked for the number that made that call.
They and their captian and the captain and lt from the town she lived in went to her and (rumors, she gother ass chewed out, didnt see her for 3 yrs (wasnt in jail)...

@ariannajohannson6177,It's really too bad but I'm glad Johnny  Depp  is standing to false claims. And I'm not a man and have been married to two physical abuse and one more mental but all I left without taking anything  or fighting  for anything.  I struggled but decided  to move on. I've been to church  several times  in several places but it's been hard because  men are often already took there so you see all these what seem like happy people  but there's fewer then many years ago. And when I've dated so often men say no I been married and not going through that again. So what I think is when it's not mostly a two person thing and only one person having  to give give give money and a woman seeking what she can get scars men. It's OK to want stuff and I am sad it's not the same. Because  I'm not huge up keep. Long as food in my belly and roof over head and able to seek my career  ideas without being stifled by the man and both can do as they wish and be happy together  understanding  sometimes there's disagreements  but most times coming to a happy medium without crazy drama and physical threats or confrontation.  I think that's what men would rather because  it would  be about love not things or massive controle. Making each other happy.  I know that sounds like wishful thinking  but it use to exist. Luckily I've been blessed in looking  young then my age for much longer so I take my time and if someone  becomes  right then awesome but I almost forsee in the future friend relations becoming dominant  and more what friends can do  for each other.

The two were in a parking lot doing drugs. The client had to decide if he would either do 6 yrs, or take it to trial, where if he lost, would do life in prison. My lawyer said, he didn't have advice on the matter, other than giving him a layout of what's up. The client took the six yrs. 

I'd like to add, he was a very good, and aggressive lawyer, who handled my case beautifully; to where I didn't receive jail time. I was actually lucky for that, due to many factors.

@philosopherofkaos8829,"The one thing that no one teaches men (boys) today is semen retention. I‚Äôm a genXer and only started realising this since 34/35 how vital it is to NOT think with your dick with every female you meet.

It sullies the ability to find a higher genetically (which translates into psychologically sufficient to female).

During my transition (after 3 LTR mind you over 14 years of dating) once I started denying women the chance to sleep with me and stopped sleeping around I realised how power we are as men but also how quick and easy it is to deny a female and read the none verbal cues of who NOT to even waste your time with. 

In John and Psalms it says ‚Äúis it not written in your laws that ye are gods‚Äù 

You must affirm your divine connection to god to tap into this ability. You need to NOT worship consistently at the throne of materialism alone but trust that who you are inside, your soul is a divine creation and that your mission transcends your own egocentric illusion of selfishness.

But the paradox is to others? You WILL appear selfish because they won‚Äôt understand. They‚Äôre still based in this world, the egos rules, the matrix and until you find that part of yourself that is divine you will always stumble because your source of joy is placed in the animalistic reptilian Brain.

@Babymercy8,"Ultimately, I believe once you're married, you shouldn't get divorced (except for cheating.) I have no experience with the legal system in terms of marriage/divorce (I'm engaged) but the best thing to do is marry a good Christian person that you know very well.

What my generation, specifically, needs to learn is that marriage isn't all about feelings; it's about serving. Most people do really well with serving the SO while dating and engaged, then they get lazy once married. You really need to have intention once you're married. Think daily about how to serve and make your other half feel loved. Even when you're married you should go on dates, be intimate, learn more about each other, tend to the others needs, etc. There's a lot that goes into keeping a good marriage (from what I've read, heard, and seen)

He was convinced with no evidence against him other than her word. he wasn‚Äôt even in the state when she said it happened. Just a few episodes ago I believe you would have admonished him because he was convicted. Now you‚Äôre saying that the justice system is broken. Again love you guys just bringing this out.

@sgrove140,"I rarely if ever comment on anything online. However, Stephen, I very much enjoy your show and appreciate the work and long unpaid hours you spend making this happen. So, I‚Äôve chosen to comment then on the balance issue.

I don‚Äôt understand why there has to be a balance. I never have. I went after the woman that I wanted to marry when I got her, even though she was so unbelievably outside my league I cannot tell you. Nothing is changed about marriage, nor courtship. What has changed is what is acceptable in the modern world. If a person claims to be a Christian, it is just simply made harder. I am a professing Christian, and I believe our relationship to our spouse is the same as it was when God ordained it.
The modern legal system, the modern interpretation of marriage, and the modern interference by the state doesn‚Äôt change any of this. I just think it simply means a man, yes man, must raise his standards and work harder to find the one who will fulfill his covenant on earth. Since I was lucky enough that God blessed me with my dream girl so early in life, I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers. However, I would just simply say that men should not give up on the ultimate standard of marriage simply because the quality has been eroded by the modern world. Men, stand up for what you want and for what you believe. Find a girl who will do what God has in store for our families. Is it hard? Yes.

@sleezyace3868,"This trial is big. Prenup is the only way I would consider marrying at this point in society. It's too much of a risk when you can potentially have your life ruined because your life partner wanted to play mind games with you until you break and take all finical assets as well as your kids and leave you broken mentally. The conversation of prenup will really help show the true colors of the partner. If you're really in the relationship for love the paper is just a signature. This also effects women who truly want a ""traditional strong family values man"". Talking to my hair stylist over the past 8 years he has had many conversations with women (here in Massachusetts) that want a strong man; however, they don't feel comfortable dating because of what their circle of female friends will say. (Along with the fact that they are traditional women and complain no man will ask them out,) So rather than try to find love they stay single and blame men that they don't ask them to go out.

If he leaves he should definitely pay for both of them, because he betrayed them. If she leaves, she should not get anything.

@spatulamahn,"From someone who has been through it, marriage is a contract and, as such, should not have ""no fault"" breakage.  If you want to abandon the marriage you should be able to - but you lose all rights to any property, child custody, etc.  Other than proven reasons, such as drug use, alcoholism, and real abuse (not the fake ""verbal abuse"" claimed by most women), you should be required to work out your differences.  There is no incentive to work out differences anymore.  Why would a woman work out issues in a marriage when 99% of the time she gets everything she wants and doesn't have to put up with the man anymore?",8,2022-04-21T21:56:32Z,2022-04-21T21:56:32Z

@garymcaleer6112,"""Thy desire shall be to thy husband"" was GOD'S prophecy to our Premier Mother Eve and every generation following. Men have a part to play to earn that desire. I've heard it said: ""Women are nothing but a wet hole."" This view disgraces both the woman & the GOD who created her to ""be an help mate.""

It all ties in with the Apostle Paul's discussing the distribution of strengths & talents. 

But women today have turned their backs on what GOD ordained to be the woman's supreme happiness. Suddenly their lust to rule has become as foolish as men's: always trying to satisfy what Solomon said can never be satisfied. 

If anybody knew that lesson, it was King Solomon who received the greatest combination of wealth, power & wisdom the world will ever know. He had hundreds of inherited wives and concubines not to mention the admiration of his nation and surrounding nations.

So when the devil's 3rd temptation of Christ offered Him all the riches and power of the world, Jesus remembered Solomon, who at the end of his days said it was all ""vanity and vexation of spirit."" In other words, RUBBISH! 

The LORD sent the devil packing! Fools today have yet to learn the lesson: You can't take it with you. All you'll have is your character.",0,2022-04-21T21:56:01Z,2022-04-21T21:56:01Z

@runthenumbers9698,"The thing to realize about the Johnny Depp thing is that his is kind of a perfect storm kind of case.
 
Not that long ago, he was probably the biggest schoolgirl crush in Hollywood... and for a long time too. He's petite. He's never played an intimidating character. He made most of his money on Disney. He's a Liberal. And his wife... she's widely known to be psycho, she actually injured him, and shit in his bed.
 
Now, imagine the inverse... Chuck Norris is accused of spousal abuse and she turned up with a badly cut finger and found shit on her side of the bed... and she (I don't know who he's married to. This is part of the hypothetical) is a demure sweetheart that everyone in America loves... and has never hurt a fly.
 
They would've burried Chuck Norris under the prison.
 
Johnny Depp's case checks ALL of the boxes for a male victim... and STILL his ex-wife is able to play the victim narrative to a sizeable crowd.
 
What does this tell you about the presumption of innocence? It's a joke. It took one of the most beloved people in Hollywood being so blatantly and shamelessly abused that it cannot be denied... just to offset people's presumptions... particularly women. It took one of the century's biggest heartthrobs to get women to listen to him.

We‚Äôll you just took away 50% of the options for a partner. Especially when the next step after marriage is kids. I want my kids in private Christian schools. I don‚Äôt want my kids growing up with degeneracy being an option. If a prospective partner disagrees then that‚Äôs a dealbreaker!  The list of dealbreakers has gotten so long how do you find a partner?  Money wise I‚Äôve always been taught that prenups are in a way sinful because you‚Äôre expecting the relationship to fail. We live in a world today where a prenup may be more necessary than ever. Also finding a fellow Christian is key. Although I don‚Äôt want to be with a ‚Äúcrazy Christian‚Äù either.

@maggot9276,"There are two double standards which probably don't balance out.

1st - If a chick is promiscuous she is a whore, but if the dude sleeps with 20 chicks, he is a stud.
2nd - When a man is being abused by a woman he is a pussy, but if a woman is abused, she should (rightfully so) be saved by all means.

The problem is that the 1st standard, in my opinion, is easily dismissed. Its logical to say ""no the guy is a slut too"", but if a man is abused  he need to prove it thoroughly, not to mention, to not care about being called a bitch.

Another thing, there was this trend on tik tok, where men were explaining why a man is screwed in a marriage and why not to get married. These tik toks, were UNIVERSALLY MOCKED to hell by all women. They were memed as the online ""alpha males"". I've yet to see one woman admit that men have certain obstacles in this matter.",0,2022-04-21T20:56:48Z,2022-04-21T20:56:48Z

@ungabungaable,"you asked for comment, so here it is, this is from personal experience. so, I don't care about winning anything but men need to wake up!!!! So here goes. the court system is geared to strip a man of all his rights. I was married in the 90's, my ex's family used the old he touched my kids privates to try and destroy me, criminal court saw through it kicked the case, but the CPS decided to trial me in children's court, which I wasn't even allowed to go inside, and they railroaded what ever till I couldn't even see my kids, did the court check to see if her and her family had done this before? NO !!!! but every man she has ever been with was accused of such. and to make matter worse she ended up catching a drug case and my 2 sons ended up in foster care for years, i was deemed unfit and they racked up 500,000 dollar in "" child support "" that i am still paying on to this day with their compound interest. so back to my sons, they end up being abused, molested, raped and all kinds of stuff in their institutions and by the time i was deemed "" safe "" they waited till each kid was 17 when they transitioned them home. so the financial cut off was done. so they come home and they are very medicated and broken. and I'm in debt to the state now to 1,000,000.00 cause they add compound interest. so with that, why get married? why have kids? the states were empowered by Clinton with his "" dead beat dad "" law. states have figured out how to maximize this into huge profits, with compound interest. women use this to financially rape men. what's in it for us? we are disposable income for women to claim they are "" independently strong women "" there is no reason to get married these days cause ya never know what you have, schools teach women to be self seeking narcissistic victims and men are evil. So my warning to you guys is run forest run........and people wonder why the porn industry is exploding. in order for "" Marriage "" to change states need to change their laws, cause as long as men or disposable income this is not gonna get any better. as long as we have no rights, this isnt gonna get better. court system has been change so much when Clinton signed the dead beat dad law, and if you are not the father ya have 1-2 years to say you are not or you get stuck with the child support too that needs to change. as long as women keep playing off the white knight guys playing the victim with their lies nothing is gonna change.",0,2022-04-21T20:44:34Z,2022-04-21T20:47:59Z

@MathiusKajal,"My main issue with marriage is that it takes away all the incentives for women to make the relationship work.

This is basic human psychology: Humans tend to repeat behaviors that produce benefits or positive emotions, and tend to avoid behaviors that create conflict or negative emotions. If every time that i train my wife tells me that i look great and that she loves my body, i'm probably going to keep training and be very motivated to do so. If every time i cook she says is disgusting and that i should never get close to the kitchen again, i'm probably going to stop cooking as it will be associated with a bad feeling and response. We seek rewards and avoid stress.

Now think about that concept in the marriage business. If i marry a woman, i'm going to be extremely incentivized to make that relationship work. Why? Well, because if the relationship fails and we get divorced, i lose everything. I can't see my children, i lose my car, my house, a part of my salary, etc. If the relationship works, i get heavily rewarded, if the relationship fails, i get heavily punished. High motivation on both ends, wanting to get something and to avoid something. But what about the woman? If the relationship fails and we get divorced, she keeps everything she already had and maybe even more. If she didn't own a house before, she does now, or the car or simply the money. Amber Heard got 7 million dollars just as a settlement. I believe that this is the reason so many marriages are unhappy, particularly for the men, because the women are in a situation where if the relationship fails it's like ""so what?""

What if once you marry, the woman decides to stop having sex with you, quit's her job to live off your salary and never cook or clean the house or even shower anymore? Yeah, it would be terrible, and? Where's the loss for HER? Divorce will get her everything she already has plus more things. If i fail, i lose a lot, but if the woman fails... she loses nothing, or even worse, she GAINS from it. There's no incentive for the woman to work for the relationship. I risk everything and she risks nothing. There's no way that formula is going to end up well. That's why i have decided to never get married EVEN THOUGH i do want a serious monogamous relationship, and even a family, but the legal aspect is way too unbalanced. The ""equality for women"" never included the equal responsability part. I can understand the idea that the woman keeps everything 300 years ago where women were really dependent of a man to make a living, but if in the modern world they can work and make as much money as a man or even more, then it's time for them to face risks and loses too if marriage fails.

And just to be clear, i don't even live in USA. This is pretty much a problem for man everywhere.",0,2022-04-21T20:36:41Z,2022-04-21T20:36:41Z

@logansikina4006,"To the question at the beginning: I would say to have straight forward conversations with your partner on that issue before marriage is dire. To actually know and understand each other before making that commitment, and once you decide to take that step together, (marriage) to take it seriously, to honor and respect it. ‚ÄúUntil death do we part‚Äù should hold some weight and meaning. Unfortunately greed and vengeance have a great hold over many people which can really grow and develop during divorce proceedings. This is especially escalated in severity and consequence when children are involved. Children are not bargaining chips to be used against others to win you favor or literally cash and prizes. Although marriage may have a growing ‚Äúfrightening aspect‚Äù causing reluctancy to become engaged with (pun intended), it is a great institution with many merits when understood, taken seriously, and respected.

@Woody_TwoShoes,I would like to see a world where marriage is not just a legal document that allows two people to do taxes together. I think making it almost financially impossible for a woman to stay home and be the housewife or the stay at home mom and the husband or dad to go to work and know he‚Äôs making enough to support that is wrong. I‚Äôm not saying all women need to stay home and be in the kitchen and if they want to go to work that is an option but with every positive thing (such as making double income) there is a negative (such as not having time to raise your own kids or maintain a stable home condition). I am married and have two wonderful daughters under 2 years old and my biggest struggle is the constant feeling and proof in the bills of not being able to support my family financially. If I want to support them in this economy I typically have to give up time with them to work more hours or pick up extra labor somewhere else. It‚Äôs been so engrained In women‚Äôs heads that they need to be self sustaining and ‚Äúnot need no man‚Äù that they stop trying or maybe their parents don‚Äôt even teach them the importance of how to be a wife/mom. My wife is a good example of parents who both worked and didn‚Äôt have the time that they needed to be great home parents/examples.

But the thing is I was one of those guys who was trying to develop the boys games a bit more to be inclusive, yeah you can come along on our BMX ride we can make it more about fun at the circle track and less about racing and strength-heavy tricks, it is actually a kind of fun to have a bigger group of more different people all laughing and doesn't have to be heavy competition all the time, I was one of the smaller guys anyway so wasn't exactly a front runner on the best of days, I could get where they're coming from, everyone wants to have fun and not be excluded. But yet fast forward and I still get treated like one of the guys women need to get back at for those days when most of the little boys excluded them.

@e.starling141,"An older couple and a more middle aged couple that I'm very close to are both getting divorced.  In both cases the husbands were the only ones that worked full time and both make/made good money, with one of the men making REALLY good money.  Whereas both of the wives had part time jobs for a very short amount of time, and neither job was very well paid.   But in both cases the wives are getting half of all the money and assets.  It is one of those things that doesnt seem especially fair to me, but i do understand why a wife (who has lived a certain lifestyle for many yrs) wants to maintain that lifestyle. (I also feel a little better about it because neither husband was wealthy when they married.)  However, should the wives get half when they werent the one bringing in the money?  Or maybe should it be more like they get 40%?  That seems a little more fair to me just given that the person responsible for earning that money seems more entitled to it than the person who didnt. Even though the money became ""theirs"" when its put into a mutual checking or savings account.  And i could see the argument for the wife getting even less.  Idk. Its a tough situation.  I will say though that sometimes having a crap ton of money makes divorce easier for the person who didnt earn the money.  For example i dont know that the 1 wife would have filed for divorce if she didnt have the safety of the crap ton of money that she'll get in the divorce.  (The marriage wasnt that contentious imo.)

@AmyLeeJimSan,"My mom physically abused me growing up, and my dad was also emotionally abused, which led to a divorce. My mom was left with a huge house my dad had to pay for fully...when I was 13 I quickly went to court in a desperate attempt to escape my mom. I knew my dad wasn't the best, but it was easier to deal with him than the constant beatings I was enduring. In court, the social worker noticed my mom was not mentally stable and asked to evaluate her, but my mom quickly tried to make a deal with my dad. The court decision was that if he continued paying for my child support, he could take me, so he did. 
Unfortunately for me, my dad was too focused on looking for younger women to date and kicked me out of the house as soon as I graduated high school. ( I was 17)
Where I live you are a minor until your 21st birthday, and if you decide to go to university, your parents are legally responsible for you until you are 25. I did not know this and ended up meeting a man online who promised to help me, and ended up trafficking me. 
There have been many studies that show that abused kids have a higher chance of ending up in abusive relationships and a situation such as my own. 
Ironically, women are treated so nicely in divorce courts that a lot of the time the children end up in the wrong hands. 
My case is an outlier, in which both my parents were a disaster, yet I hold no grudge against either. I just hope other victims can receive proper care and are heard, whether they are male or female.",55,2022-04-21T19:57:56Z,2022-04-21T19:57:56Z

What has turned me off from ever getting married and why Johnny Depp‚Äôs tale hits a bit close? Personal experiences growing up with two sisters. Going to school with women that were a very mixed bag. Let‚Äôs not forget the college feminist. That and I saw my parents marriage turn into a dysfunctional mess thanks to those very two sisters.

Are the men afraid the women will KILL them if they report it? Think about it. Also, why are the men believed so easily over the WOMEN in those cases? If we are going to give the statistics on REPORTED abuse and assume that is the only abuse going on, it's not a fair discussion. Also, VERY often, the man has emotionally abused the woman over such a long period of time, refusing to have a conversation with her or to fix the hurt he has caused, and after so much time the woman is driven to anything to BE HEARD and her pain acknowledged by the passive aggressive abuser, until she loses control. JUST AS HE WANTED HER TO, then after she physically lashes out, the man controls her further by running to the police crying abuse. Don't shoot a woman, then be surprised when she bleeds. Psychopaths, aspergers, and gaslighting is committed by men way more than by women. After 20 or 30 years of constant abuse, lying, neglect, and being diminished to nothing, the woman will eventually resort to anything to make the man accountable. This is what the man wants, and then he makes HER accountable for ONCE answering the years and years of emotional abuse. Where are the ""CRIME"" stats for all the women who live in fear physically and emotionally with men who don't leave marks???  Where are the jail terms for men who threaten to take her children, or kill her if she tells anyone at all that she suffers daily? Where is that accountability? üòï Where is the accountability for ghe men who use Gheorghe wives secually as just another masterbatory toy, then claim she withdrew affection when she refuses to compromise her dignity anymore?

@KrymsunShaddoe,"There should be two types of marriage that don't really have much to do with each other.
1. Religious marriage. Two people bind their lives and souls together in the eyes of whatever deity or holy power they believe in. Any details about marriage and divorce would depend on the particular religion.
2. Legal marriage. This should only be used by the state as an incentive for child rearing. Let people get tax breaks or other incentives in so much as it makes it easier to raise a child in a healthy, two parent environment. Divorce in this situation would focus primarily on child custody and support. Whoever has primary custody of the child has the upper hand in deciding who gets jointly owned property if it becomes a legal issue, because that would benefit the child more. (Wouldn't want to leave the other person destitute of course.)

Plenty of details I'm certainly overlooking, but that's just my general idea of how it should work.",0,2022-04-21T19:12:57Z,2022-04-21T19:12:57Z

I really do feel though that most women who are abused and don't call the cops or leave that very first time suffer in silence and do not report it. Marriage is a tough one, I don't ever want to see good men have their kids and half their wealth taken by a jerk. What I see day to day though is most often women who devote their lives to their husband and kids, start to age and then the husband leaves her. In that case it is only fair for the woman who put her career on hold to serve her family(which is harder and more demanding then most jobs and no vacation or time off) to get alimony and child support.

@Speed-Of-Light-By-Meter,"I dated a girl who was bi-polar (she was diagnosed professionally when she was a teenager).  She was smart, beautiful, funny...until she had her third drink.

One night, out at a nice restaurant/bar she drank to the point that she could barely walk or speak.  She then decided to start a fight with me, and said she was driving home.  While pleading with her to calm down and come back inside, she attacked me in the parking lot.  She was about 5'1"" and 105lbs, so I wasn't all that concerned...until three police cars converged on where we were standing.  I never touched her, just kept backing away and telling her I'd rather she hit me and yell than get in her car and kill herself or someone else.

As soon as she saw the police, she stopped, and with a huge grin, said ""ooooooh, you're going to jail, you're going to jail...""  The officers surrounded us, and I was just about to try to explain when the lead guy says to me, ""sir, are you all right?""

I've never seen a smile disappear so fast.  Two officers took her away, and one of them asked me what was going on...I explained the situation, and thankfully, he understood.  All I can think of is, there was another guy in the parking lot who saw the whole thing, called 911 and said, hey, this guy is getting punched by this girl...I suppose it could have been a woman, but...

Point of the story - guys do get abused, and girls do lie about it.  My ""justice"" was immediate, but I've never forgotten that experience.

@IPlayVideoGamesAndNothingElse,"To remove the forced labor of men to women by issuing of alimony as well as child support. The woman can force a man to be a father if they have sex but a man cannot force a woman to be a mother. The woman can lie about being on birth control, falsely say they are pregnant, buy positive pregnancy tests from other women, and get pregnant by another man then claim it belongs to the one that makes the most money. Men have two options 1. Not have sex ever to prevent getting trapped. 2. Go to the other side of town and lie about your name so she can‚Äôt track you down later. Number 2 is the only way that you can sleep with a woman and if she does any of that shady stuff you have a way out.",0,2022-04-21T19:08:21Z,2022-04-21T19:10:02Z

@ImThatGuy17,"Marriage (as a man - XY chromosomes with a penis since we have to clarify nowadays) has always been about fulfilling a God-defined role, from my perspective. There is satisfaction in providing, protecting, and fostering a healthy household for my wife and three children. While I don't enjoy the toiling of the ground Adam cursed us with (work Monday-Friday for 40 hours a week), I know that it directly impacts the quality and nature of their well-being in providing a home, clothes, food on the table, and surplus of blessings that they get to live with each day.

My wife also agrees and knows that her role as care-taker, nurturer, and teacher most greatly benefit them and myself in that duty to the family structure, as much as some things (laundry, cooking, cleaning) may get tiresome. I do try to assist as much as possible with household duties, but we recognize the greater truth that we are opposites that support each other's strengths and weaknesses. God intended each sex to be good and bad/naturally more or less inclined at some things over others and wants us to work together as the perfect team in loving and supporting each other and in raising children.

Men let their wives take the lead you default because they don‚Äôt want the conflict, avoid sacrificing their wants for their families needs, etc. Wives, in turn, get frustrated and angry with their responsibility which causes tension and fighting.

@ermacjones4821,"I don't know what the hell people do to become some weird thing called a ""porn addict"". Drugs I get, and love honestly, but that actually makes sense. Porn though? How the hell can someone get addicted to that? I'm single most of the time, I don't really enjoy spending a lot of time with anyone, or playing the stupid games that come with a relationship. So, being single, it seems more than reasonable to watch porn a couple times a week or something, that's nothing close to an addiction. I guess I just assume that's how most people do it.

Are there really people out there who make it like an all day, everyday kind of thing? Because that's an addiction, and it's pretty stupid if porn is your addiction. Does sex really mean that much? I don't think so. Sex is ok and all, but I guess maybe I'm just tainted by the heaven that is opioids. 

You give me a choice between an entire night with Emma Stone, or 150mg of Morphine, I'll always take the Morphine, and I love Emma Stone. I'm going to put that shit up my nose and take a 14 hour cat nap, because that's literally heaven.",0,2022-04-21T18:49:55Z,2022-04-21T18:49:55Z

@glrebert1,"When I married 30+ years ago, we were living our lives like the examples set before us. As things progressed in society, the focus on the ""I"" and not the we  became very prevalent. The roles had deteriorated to the point where couples were more like roommates in the new society. Men didn't want to be the bad guy and insist on higher standards out of women. Live and let live so to speak. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, women felt a need not to be with men. Feminist groups are instructing women to tell men ...You can stay if you want to, but I'm doing this. Men have now been blungoned over the head in the past generation to say ""thanks but no thanks"" to marriage unless they find someone truly exceptional. I don't say this as a doom or gloom thing, but think, would you marry someone like AoC? There's a lot like them out there.

@sparrow420500,"I am proud to say I have been married to the same woman for 13 years, this August. We have been together since 2004.
In the last 17 years we have had plenty of ups and downs. We argue and fight with each other, but we always get over it. At the end of the day we always have each other's backs and we are partners.
Funny how in nearly 17 years we have never physically laid hands on each other in anger, yet it seems like Amber Heard couldn't even make it one.
Also, I have an uncle who was chronically abused by his ex-wife physically. He never tried to defend himself, because he was brought up NEVER to jit women  and would frequently have black eyes or fat lips. One night she got angry and hit him in the face with a hammer. Out of reflex he swung his hand out and hit her with the back of it, cutting her cheek a little bit (he had a stone in his ring.)
Even though he had a broken cheekbone and there was medical evidence of him being hit by her, she cried that he was trying to kill her, and she ended up getting 15 years in jail. Unlike a Subway shooter, or someone who runs over people at a parade, he did every day of those 15 years.

@pastorlyndon,"The changes I want to see in the institution of marriage are simple:

1. Talk about marriage as a covenant before God to come together and serve one's spouse (men and women both) as well as ones children.  Marriage isn't about meeting one's ""felt needs"", doubling the household income or finding a free servant.

2. Remove all the easy outs to abandoning said covenant and talk about infidelity and adultery as the shameful activities they are. We should stop celebrating when people abandon faithfulness to their families and spouse in some sort of immoral self-expression or self-discovery.

3. Stop talking about recreational sex as the goal of a relationship and talk about all the real consequences and personal fallout of unhinged hedonism. We need to talk about marriage as the real good that it is, not the hypothetical necessary evil it is not.

@calancrt,"I am very glad you are taking on the domestic violence issue. Most people do not understand just how corrupt our legal system is and Family Court is by far one of the worst fraught with corruption, money laundering and criminalizing innocent people by the masses. Over the past few decades Domestic Violence Laws were implemented  to protect victimized women and children from gross violent abuse, but over the years lawmakers, judges and legislatures have gone to great lengths to broaden the pool of female victims as it provides more opportunities for income both to attorneys and to the judicial system. Unless you have been victimized or in a divorce, specifically with custody, you would never know just out of whack the laws are. I found this out the hard way in 2009 when my ex-wife decided she wanted out of our marriage. I was already behind the 8-ball due to trying to keep peace for the best interests of my children. The day I was served divorce papers I was at the library where they had 3 books on hold for my wife at the time. Each book had to do with how best to play the system to maximize the financial benefits for a woman and screw the man. In 2009 she accused me of DV simply because she tripped over a box chasing after me because I was leaving the apartment to defuse the situation. She filed a police report claiming I pushed her over a box in the living room and I had to go to court. The judge at the time issued a Order of Protection telling both of us that whoever gets out of line would be going to jail and suggested I move to a different apartment to try to make peace and try to reconcile our relationship for the sake of the kids. So I did, but it also cost me as she called both the police and DCF to my house a minimum of once a week as soon as the kids were dropped off and made my life hell for 6 months before skipping town and moving halfway across the country.

Shortly after our divorce in 2010, the judge did not make her come back but based my child support at 80% of the responsibility or 45% of my income. The home state we were in based CS off of how much time each parent had with the children as well as the incomes of both parents. The parent with more time would get more support with the one with less would pay out more. The objective my ex attempted was to remove any time with me and my children so she would maximize the support burden to me. The state where the case was filed refused to have a modification of the case so she filed in the state she moved to with the attempt to vacate my parental rights (which is know as Parental Alienation which is a grooming of one parent to the children to demonize the other parent for financial and victim gain). Prior to going in for the kill shot, she file two more times with claims of domestic violence against me all the while refusing me any visitation as ordered by the court. The initial state was on to her canceling her request and filing an arrest warrant for false claims against my ex. So she filed in the state she was in 1,200 miles away. The judge asked how I could abuse her residing 1,200 miles away and she said ""because he was asking about visitation and got mad when I told him that I wasn't going to give him the ordered visitation and I am AFRAID FOR MY LIFE."" 

Under state laws throughout the US, if someone who is in a domestic relationship claims they are afraid for their life, the courts are required to take extreme measures to where the accused MUST prove their innocence. Domestic Violence & Family Court is the only area where one is assumed guilty and must prove their innocence. As a result she took this sham order to use for the next 2 years to vacate my visitation and communication with my kids. So for the past 13 years I have not had a relationship with my children. Each are adults today and to this very day my ex has used her false allegations  to get a fully furnished house for next to nothing, slanders me and destroyed my livelihood in the area where she lives (which was the place we lived for 2 decades while dating and being married) and speaks for a woman's shelter badmouthing me for more than a decade and encouraging my daughter to do the same so she can gain an additional income.

I am only one of many people victim of this issue and bad law. There are many more who have had to deal with this as well from the non-famous to the famous including Chris Rock, Brad Pitt, Dwight Howard and so many more. Some have had the money to fight the false claims paying out millions, but most do not and have to live daily with the scars as myself. The issue is real and although I may not be a fan of Johnny Depp, I do understand the damage he has suffered at the hands of a malicious and calculated woman out to destroy his life and it is NOT RIGHT.",0,2022-04-21T18:29:09Z,2022-04-21T18:29:09Z

@bamadixiedelightlucyq777,My husband and I have a system where if we are at the point of just wanting to slap the shit out of each other cause we are just to pissed to deal with it that we immediately stop and tell the other that I love you but right now I just don't like you and it is the ending of any argument or disagreement that mentally you are breaking down and that it's time to walk away before it gets stupid. We never go to bed without handling whatever the situation is or what ever it is that has upset us. We know that it must be resolved so that it cannot carry onto the following day. We refuse to fight over petty things and we also make sure that the other one knows before they lay their head down that we love them and sometimes that leads to make up loving and almost always makes me feel even closer to him and him to me. He is my best friend and I am his. He is my bulldog and I love his strength and dedication to our family our marriage and his faith in God. Most women naturally are attracted to men who stand upon their own feet and not waiver or kneel down to them when we test our guys out to see what they will turn  a blind eye to. It's crazy that we do this to guys but we are programmed at birth this way and I think it is a way to see if the guy is marriage potential and is worthy of having a child with them even if we as women don't even realize that is what it is we are doing when the mind games begin and we torment our guys minds with really stupid stuff like hey I'm going out with my single girl friends cause it's girls night when really we already know why we shouldn't go but we test the mental strength of our guys to see just how committed are they and if they ever give in and let their virtue their very beliefs the foundation in which they stand upon to be manipulated that well he then becomes weak and we don't even know why we then are sickened by them and looking for the next best thing. It really is like this I hope young men are told the truth before they end up with a girl that was a mistake from it's beginning. Never give in to us on what you know is right and you best be firm cause the first time you kneel down you have already opened the door for the girl to second guess you and that is when the ending of that relationship begins. Period. Women are all Eve's and men are all Adam's. So guys don't eat the forbidden fruit no matter how hard we try and sell you on how sweet it is. And ladies if he eats the apple you sold him just know he isn't the one for you cause all you will do is use him and he has no clue what he is doing cause he is not mature enough to be settling down cause he has yet to have found his foundation and will not be ready for any marriage or starting a family with you cause he would not be the bulldog that will answer the door when the wolves come knocking. It will be you answering and last I checked you the lady not the man you could not protect you or your children cause heck he couldn't even stand up to you when you just used your tongue to twist him into giving into you even though you knew from the start you were wrong. It's this simple but sadly we don't tell our children growing up the things they will face when they begin dating and finding someone to have a d to hold till death do they part.,0,2022-04-21T18:28:49Z,2022-04-21T18:28:49Z

@aprilwarren8700,"I was married for over 25 years. It became a very abusive marriage. LE was called a handful of times and my ex went to jail once (he was drunk and broke the window out of my car while our youngest was in her car seat, glass everywhere). I always believed I'd be married once and live happily ever after lol. During our divorce I just wanted to be ""free"" as in no longer married. At first, I wanted to take what was mine out of anger but as time went on, I wanted nothing. There was nothing we had together that I wanted. My kids (adults now) were the only thing that mattered. 

I wasn't about ""fighting over stuff"". I think nowadays, women and some men are too easily able to accuse their significant other of abuse etc. I do believe that men are immediately accused of horrendous things and have to fight to prove their innocence. The institution of marriage has been defiled because it's too easy to just get into a relationship and quit when things get tough. People don't seem to want longevity anymore. 
I've been in my current relationship for 10 years. He never was married and never had kids. He traveled for work a lot so relationships were tough. We are both of the mindset that we're enjoying each other and living in the moment. If we get married, cool. If we don't, cool.

@nickernator4788,"In custody court I wasn't allowed to bring up the fact that she was IN jail and facing prison for 24 counts of fraud. the judge practically plugged his ears and said ""la la la la I can't hear you!"".

later she was convicted of all 24 counts, served 28 of 60 days in county jail, and was required to pay restitution of less than 10% of what she stole. she only paid half of that after claiming she was struggling as a mom.. a mom that has seen her kid a whole week in the last 2 years. 

she was able to use the restitution to get child support lowered, 

After false restraining orders and smear tactics, the empowered woman used woman's advocacy groups, who convinced her to claim I pushed her up (not down) the stairs 3 years before, and use it for a restraining order.. the judge upheld the restraining order because ""at this point, considering how much she's done to you, I would probably be thinking about hurting her myself. And, if I don't uphold this R.O. i might end up in the local newspaper."".

..so my life was ruined. but, because  I played it nice, she later dropped the r.o. saying she was only scared she would loose custody. no punishment for that fraud either. no judge demanding she reimburse anyone for the waste of time.  

she got away with fraud. I was left paying 200k to secure my daughter has a father, and now have a child with cPTSD, severe trust issues, and she's going to a crap public school. good job Washington county Oregon.",3,2022-04-21T18:23:59Z,2022-04-21T18:24:55Z

I also think abuse rates are something to be worth noticing between men and women im not sure who had the highest but from some of the comments ive seen women have probably the higher abuse rates in a marriage but its just something men dont want to talk about which is why mens suicide rates are higher as well. I honestly font know what i would want to see done other then maybe a marriage having some sort of built in prenuptial agreement in the beginning of the marriage and then the rules to that agreement have a period of time where they expire snd then whether you choose to renew the prenuptial agreement or not now i dont know how well it would work but it would get rid of some of those people that would only want one thing out of a relationship.

@worldhistorys-md2rz,Hey Steven I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll see this message or not but I have a question but first off I want to say I really appreciate this video I have not been in a abused relationship before but I am currently 24 years old single but I‚Äôve been looking ahead in my future in the aspect of wanting to get married or not and I weighed up a lot of the positives and the negatives in these negatives that persist in marriage seen the positive for example my parents have stayed married for a very long time and also my grandparents and I can see how a monogamous marriage that stays together can really work and benefit a child and I want that for my future kids but I also can see a lot of negatives in it comes to both parties can cheat on each other or one files divorce and Guy‚Äôs and Women can hit the guy more in the financial in as someone. Working on myself as a young man right now and preparing my life And willing to work hard for my dreams and wanting a lady to be by my side marriage seems really nice but also it can be extremely risky for me. So if you see this or if anybody has an answer or a good guidance I am open to hear it I think this  speaks  to a lot to a lot of young men that are growing up and seeing how marriage is not always sunshine and rainbows and It can have risky alternatives but I just want to guide myself and do the right thing and ask for Guidance if anyone has a good answer I‚Äôm more than willing to hear,0,2022-04-21T18:09:46Z,2022-04-21T18:09:46Z

I also think that both men and women can be equally bad actors when it comes to crimes and parental duties and both can equally be a crappy parent. I think we need a change to the system in place that allows for a male parent or boyfriend to walk into a courtroom and almost immediately be labeled either the primary agressor or bad parent leaving the other female defended  looking like a victim or great parent.

I wonder if that started from Woman A (for the example) abusing her then significant other, Man A, and Man A leaves her, and she, in a fit, swears off men, only going for women. Woman A then gets into a relationship with Woman B, and immediately starts abusing B the way she did to Man A, and, because women can hit other women (societal mores), Woman B starts fighting back, because 'She's independent and don't need no man!'...?

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I think most women would take advantage of the laws put before them, or even half. It's that there's a government who makes the opportunities and a culture which encourages the utilization of those opportunities. Until that changes, yes, guys are going to be backing away from it. Which is kind of funny, given that the government did it based on the assumption of ""It's either this or nothing... guys won't choose 'nothing', trust me.""

@j.b.8767,"The difference between domestic abuse in Hollywood vs the rest of the world is this: In the rest of the world, when you are abused, if you are a man, you call your mother (afraid to call your dad to tell him your old lady is kicking your ass), and she calls the police, then your attorney, while if you are a woman, you call your dad, who has to be persuaded by your mother not to kill the a-hole, then he calls the police, followed by your attorney; but in Hollywood, if your the victim of actual abuse, you call your gay lover, who calls your accountant, followed by your acting coach, usually named ""Jessie""; but if you are feigning abuse, you still call your gay lover, who calls your drama coach, still usually named ""Jessie"",  who tells you: ""Don't call the police, bitch, (applies to both men and women), you can use this!"", after which, they too, promptly call your accountant, too....

@shadowstar7388,"To answer your question about marriage;
I'm a young-ish man, I'm 29, and I've been with the same woman for 3 years. I plan on marrying her eventually, I just want to be more financially stable first. Nevertheless, we're common law. And she's my best friend. I trust her with my life. She's proven to me that I can trust her with my life. That's the connection you need if you're going to get married. You need to be together for multiple years first, and you need to know beyond a reasonable doubt that you can trust your partner. You also need to be sure that your vision and plans for the future are compatible with hers. 
I think a lot of men are sold the idea that masculinity is toxic, so they don't assert themselves in the relationship. They don't establish clear boundaries, so their woman doesn't respect them. The leftist idea that gender roles in relationships are sexist is just not true. You have to be the man in the relationship, and show that you can provide, and be strong. 
But above everything else, there needs to be true love. You need to love your partner more deeply than you love your own mother, and you need to be sure that your partner loves you the same. A lifelong commitment isn't easy. You will be challenged on everything you lie to yourself about and you'll be forced to confront it. But if you're with the right person, you'll know, because it will be worth it to you. You'll feel fulfilled, and you'll have no desire to be with anyone else.",0,2022-04-21T18:06:10Z,2022-04-21T18:06:10Z

@afatherscrisis,"I am a Christian and married a Christian woman. Very traditional and waited till marriage. Despite this, this did not stop the courts from ripping me from my children, being the target of false allegations (certainly manipulated by her family and feminist friends), and having to deal with divorce. I lost almost everything an only now 5 years later I am getting somewhere close to normal. The truth is 50-60% of new marriages fail, and close to 80% of the divorces are filed by women. When men fight for custody, only about 15% of the time do they get equal or majority custody. So then we are hit with crippling child support to the point we cannot even sustain ourselves, let alone provide for our kids during our every other weekend ""visitation"". 

So ask me if I am willing to risk again; being falsely accused (because she is bitter the relationship didnt go her way), risk having more kids I cannot see when the relationship goes bad, risk even more assets and future income to the point I can no longer pay my mortgage/rent, food, utilities or even provide for my children, risk homelessness, risk suicide (3x increase risk for divorced men vs the average), risk my mental health, my job, ect? 

The answer is ""There is no way in hell I am doing that again"". I will have to do what I can to get as much physical custody of my 2 boys and raise them and guide them through this incredibly unjust world that is increasingly becoming anti-male.",2,2022-04-21T18:03:37Z,2022-04-21T18:03:37Z

I told him the day he asked for my number that guys that I dated tend to fall in love (not kidding). He proceeded to laugh in my face and brush it off. He called me 15 minutes after leaving the job and we talked for hours, everytime we talked on the phone. He lived in IN and I lived in IL so it was a bit of a long distance relationship. We would go on dates and I would make him food. Two weeks later, he called me and told me he loved me, I told him thank you (I wasn't ready to say it). I told him a week later.  Unbeknownst to me, he was telling people at work that he would marry me if it meant not losing me. I asked him what changed his mind about getting married again and he told me that I didn't change from when we met and started dating and it showed him I was genuine in who I am.. We both suffered from our past relationships and we gave each other everything we never had before. We moved in together about 2 years later in 2014, got married in 2018.

@Geronimo_Jehoshaphat,"Well here's a trail baloon:

The Government ought not be any sort of arbitrator of marriage whatsoever. 

What any person should be able to do instead, is nominate another person for any reason as their exclusive legal executive in a mutual cooperative for custodianship/conservatorship to each other's welfare and assets in the case of autonomous agency for the respective primary becomes otherwise incapacitated - which ought not be based on any specific type of particular relationship dynamic to be arranged. So basically a modified interpretation of Civil Unions. 

Conversely, people should be incentivized to distinguish the individual soverignty of their respective assets by ownership clause because any participating party can apply to just as easily dissolve the mutual contract for any reason at any time, but if assets are determined as merged then the divying up will have to be negotiated in courts. 

Marriage is a separate religious legitimacy of standing within churches which meets certain criteria that are not relevant to Governmental distinction or favored regard, but can additionally be legalized in the aforementioned mutial conservatorship contract if desired. 

Children progeny being a different issue subject to Government protection standards, and also still in need of a legal assignment to obtain conservatorship rights upon a parent, although progeny will be automatically presumed to be under a similar non-mutual parental custodianship until the time of legally eligible consent for emancipation (unless the parent is deemed forfeit by found failure to provide adequate welfare and meet legal wardship requirements). 

Obviously no one has privledge to abuse or exploit another by mere legal contract which must be prioritized to insure that the mutual security of personhood is maintained, and can therefore be legally disputed and negated if found in breach of that criteria. Basically just take intimate sexual dynamics completely out of the equation for beaurcratic purview unless there is criminal abuse which must be addressed. 

Now that no one can ever be lawfully asked to produce proof of their marriage status to any agency of man, marriage can remain the annointed monogamously fedelic commitment before God it is meant to be, and governments cannot corrupt its sacredness by forcing the arbitrary demoralization of subversives inside of its confines to undermine its dignity and usurp its definition. 

And it's anyone else's prerogative therefore also to not acknowledge the legitimacy of a marriage if they discern a fault in its structuring. There can be no compelled speech to validate or invalidate the status of another's private circumstances, and any attempt to coerce such by auxiliary means of obstruction to civil liberty should be subject to legal consequence.

I think that's how we conserve our freedoms and traditions.",1,2022-04-21T17:58:01Z,2022-04-21T17:58:01Z

@RandySavage_,"In 2019 I beat false rape accusations from my prior girlfriend of almost 2 years. Shortly after finding out I went to dinner with a high school girl friend weeks after week broke up I had sheriffs show up at my house and literally confiscate my guns because she claimed I raped her the first time we had sex 2 years prior. She said she didn‚Äôt feel safe so she filed for a temporary order of protection hence the sheriffs taking my guns. 

I was 7 days away from graduating from Miami University (December 2019) and my degree was held for months (after I technically graduated) as I went through trials to prove it was all false. She didn‚Äôt have to prove my guilt, I had to prove my innocence. I was treated like a monster from the University throughout the whole process. 

I was a broke college kid had to come out of pocket thousands of dollars to pay for attorneys and she got all of her lawyers paid for because she was a victim and had all these women advocates. 

It was months of hell, fought and got all my guns back. I have my degree in hand,  that I earned. I beat her false allegations thankfully because I had all apple devices and it was years of saved text messages.

@memesurrectionist5112,"Comment bait, I WAS INVESTIGATED BY 14 DIFFERENT AGENCIES (cleared by all) before a judge finally put a stop to my ex‚Äôs bullshit. I‚Äôll make a VERY long story short. Started off I never wanted to date her, tried to break it off and she just wouldn‚Äôt allow it (emotionally/physically abusive.) During one break she quit taking birth control, we were still having sex, and became pregnant to force marriage. I wanted to do the right thing, got engaged, moved in, things got worse. Left her and a couple years later when she found out I was marrying she started accusations about our child (3yo, absolutely DESPICABLE AND DEGENERATE ACCUSATIONS). She was A SOCIAL WORKER IN KY. She had every connection, her mom/her had previously worked for the judge (noted manhater) we were to see. I didn‚Äôt even know she was accusing me of anything until first day of court. Timing was: I filed for joint custody, lawyer sent it out on a Friday, following Wednesday she filed for child abuse that supposedly occurred 2 months earlier. Why wait that long? I would have confronted her husband the second I found out if it happened. Judge just took her word with no testimony from me. So agency after agency cleared me. Every holiday that was supposed to be my time she would levy more accusations to stop my visitation. They would eventually clear me but I‚Äôd never get the time back. 14 agencies later, I found out from a social worker that she was being investigated for emotional abuse of our son (said she would lie if I told a judge she told me) for coaching him to lie against me. She was found guilty and was put on desk duty for a year. She works at a different place but still with other ppls kids. Imagine what she‚Äôd do to them? It was hell until my son was old enough to go to college. Now when he comes in he comes to my house, so it worked out. But now ppl give me dirty looks, shunned, and she never payed a price besides our son loving me more. The entire Social Service Dept. (except 1)she worked at was fired for random things within a year. So in Kentucky the court system is stacked against men, and definitely broken.",0,2022-04-21T17:48:30Z,2022-04-21T17:48:30Z

@Sainte305,"I've never been physically abused by a woman, mentally for sure, but not physically. Perhaps I've been selective enough to avoid abusers or maybe it is because every woman I have been with is fully aware that I am an equal opportunist when it comes to relationships. You get what you give. If anyone lays their hands on me I will retaliate, including a woman. It isn't right that women think they can abuse you and get away with it because they're female. Keep your hands to yourself or expect to be smacked like a punk. I did have this stalker chick who wanted to go out with me punch me in the throat once. I grabbed her by the neck and slammed her into the wall. Of course I was treated like an evil person and all my friends put the blame on me. Fortunately, there was a girl there that stood up for me. I certainly don't condone hitting women, but at the same time we need to be able to defend ourselves. Real quick, my friend was abused by his wife for a long time. It eventually deteriorated so badly that she ended up stabbing him like 20 times with a fucking butter knife. She went to jail and only got probation for 2 years and now he pays child support and alimony which he can't afford, so he is constantly in and out of jail for failure to pay. I feel bad for him, but this is all too normal nowadays. These women are entitled and crazy pieces of shit (Amber Heard types, not all women).",2,2022-04-21T17:47:55Z,2022-04-21T17:47:55Z

@annamag56,"It infuriates me, as a women, when I think about the shift in culture through the last few decades.  Men have really received a bad rap due to the ""toxic masculinity"" bulletin that has developed since the women's rights movement.  Personally, I want my man to stand up for his family, engage in the fatherly role of raising a child and teaching those morals to stand up for what's right.  Women have had it so easy being single mothers and handed a golden ticket to not only receive government benefits, but to also receive child support from men.  I think women are a large part of the problem that men have been so lambasted and undercut for their biological strengths which has in turn made men less manly.  I don't doubt there are plenty of men who would love a good women to have a family with but both sides have been broken in this battle of ""Who's the stronger, better sex"".  I could go on for hours but women really need to step up and stop being so gung-ho about making men more sensitive, that's OUR job as women.",49,2022-04-21T17:47:37Z,2022-04-21T17:47:37Z

@the3dhermit,"My first wife was very cruel verbally and mentally to my daughter. She left me before she told me she was pregnant and disappeared. I didn't even know I had a daughter until she was 14 years old. Then when my daughter got pregnant at 16, her mom wanted her to get an abortion. She constantly pressured her to do it. In the end there was no abortion, and now my ex goes around talking about how she the best grandmother ever. And after I found out about my 14 year old daughter for the first time I voluntarily started $500 a month child support and even helped with the new husbands business when it was about to to fold all so my daughter had a roof over her head. But none of what I actually did matters because all the lies my ex told about me, even after proven to be lies, are all my daughter believes. Now I have 3 grandchildren, The younger 2 I've never seen. The oldest is 7 and I haven't seen her since she was 2. My kid always told me how bad her mom was and how she never wanted to be like her. She is now exactly like her.

@FrostyErica,"Okay. I'm going to catch some flak, but I'm willing to stick my neck out. Personal story, I'm a child of divorce (big whoop most 80s kids were) and my father pretty much dropped out of the picture shortly after my parents divorce. It's true that 90% of divorces the mother is awarded custody, but what happens afterwards? Statically a good portion of dads disappear and just send a check. So you have one parent raising a kid with only monetary help. This does help pay the bills, but it does NOTHING for the well being of the child/ren and mother. The moms are without a break unless other family or friends step into to help. Which isn't always the case due to location and also the stupid notion that is drilled into all girls heads that they can do it all! Have a family and a career. So without help or a break the chances a mother will become abusive does increase. Not justifying their behavior, but pointing out why fathers and stable family life is needed. Parents are each other back ups. One steps in when the other needs to tap out. Unfortunately, the dads drop out of the picture. So while there are horrible women out there who have no business raising children, where are the dads? I know the system is stacked against men, but I would think if men wanted to remain in their children's life they would fight like hell to do so.",0,2022-04-21T17:45:48Z,2022-04-21T17:45:48Z

@victorandkara,Me and my wife both come from very religious families mine pentecostal and hers baptist. I from day one and still believe that the only thing that matters when it comes to a wedding is family and a preacher to merry you. That's it it's between you your wife and God not the government! But I also knew we needed to be married for her health. She suffers from chronic autoimmune issues and neurological issues. At the time her insurance was horrible and mine being a government employee is really good. Every since we got married it has been a nightmare in taxes and other things like finance's. But I do it for her to have the absolute best health care money can buy! If she hadn't had any health issues we would have done a simple wedding with a preacher exchanged rings and said fuck it to the government! And I will raise my kids to essentially be the same way. If you don't want to don't get married by the government get married in the lord's eyes he is the only thing that matters and those rings are the symbol of your commitment to each other and God not a symbol for the government to determine your status!,0,2022-04-21T17:45:35Z,2022-04-21T17:45:35Z

@LTexas23,"I think there is a multitude of reasons why men don't want to get married as much. I believe the 3 most flagrant are the degradation of the nuclear family, the proliferation of sexual immorality, and the bending of the knee of the church to social pressure/engineering. Marriage used to be about the holy union of a man and woman, granted by God, and recognized by the government. By allowing access to marriage to homosexuals and non-God fearing couples the focus shifted from a union with roots in the Bible to a modern social construct. In doing so you no longer are fostering the environment for 2 people to grow a relationship with God such as starting a family and fulfilling biblical roles with each other. There is also the fact that sexual immorality is far more prevalent than just a couple decades ago. Whether that be pornography, sex out of wedlock, or numerous other sexual sins, it has truly taken the divinity out of virginity. My wife and I were virgins until we were married and able to consummate our union as God designed. Of course there was temptation along the way that we were both able to conquer, and I truly think that might be the single greatest factor taking the allure of marriage away from young men. Why wait for marriage when you can get a substitute for sexual fulfillment anywhere you turn. Sexual sin is running rampant and its much easier to succumb to temptation than to stand defiant in the light. I feel blessed and grateful to have a wife that shares strong Christian values, without which I don't believe our marriage would be as strong as it is. It must be overwhelming and daunting for a young man of principle to be able to remain principled in today's society and I pray the good men remain strong in their morals.",0,2022-04-21T17:43:06Z,2022-04-21T17:43:06Z

@leviwarren6222,"Crowder's Question: how do we balance the desire to get married with the government's tendency to treat men unfairly regarding marriages?

How many of us guys would grab our crotches and tell the government to suck it if they told us we couldn't get married? So why would we cry about our victimhood when our government simply makes divorce hell for the man? Don't divorce (read: pick the right chick). The responsibility is on you, men, the government reflecting that to an unjust and unfair degree doesn't make it any less your responsibility. If you are the head of the household, you marry knowing full well that a divorce will be on your shoulders.


Pro tip: my wife and I have only been married for seven¬†years (expecting our fifth child in a few months) but I can say with confidence that our premarital choices effected my decision to marry her. We both managed to punch our v-cards on our wedding night. In the 90's and 00's, the divorce rate among couples maintaining their virginity until marriage was in the single digits.

@BenjaminWalker53,"As a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints there is already a baked in separation of legal marriage and Godly marriage. In the church we do what is called a sealing when a couple is married that seals the couple for time and all eternity. 

To quote Andrew Breitbart though, ""Politics (The Law) is downstream from culture"". I think that as a society we need to move back towards innocent until proven guilty for all. Meaning that unless there is evidence to accusations, then they should hold no weight. We also need to move back to real Godly love in marriage where you serve each other as opposed to Hollywood/Romcom Fall in to Love. When you can just fall into love why can't you just fall out again? Fix these kinds of culture issues and I think the laws will move in the right direction.

@claypauley1577,"I think they only way to truly ""heal"" the institution of marriage in this country is to revive the understanding of men and women's core identities and natural roles. A man and woman's God-given instincts are what help create the complimentary dynamic required to strengthen and sustain the marriage. Modern marriage seems to be more based on the idea of how someone can better your life as opposed to how you can enrich their life. That doesn't mean there can't be unique variables or situations, but when husbands and wives have a firm grip on who they are, and understand how to love their spouse, it typically creates a strong family which in turn creates a strong nation.

My faith helped me realize that marriage is a partnership and covenant towards a similar goal. If you don‚Äôt have that, along with actually enjoying being with the person, it‚Äôs going to fall apart. This needs to be taught and exampled far more often.

@uolocur9356,"I feel like there is a simple answer to your question. I balance the desire for marriage with the potential hell it can bring by judging the character of the woman I will pursue. I'm not interested women who want to be independent (dependent on themselves), I'm not interested in women who are addicted to any kind of social media, and I'm not interested in women who don't want to try and be my peace. There are plenty of other red flags, but those are the big three in my mind. I want to work/provide for my family, be able to depend on my wife for things, have edifying intellectual conversations instead of some garbage about pop culture, and come home to someone who will try to make me happy, as I would try for her.

@williamnicely4818,"To answer your question Steven, a man surrenders all of his power if he gets married in our culture. That‚Äôs why marriage rates are plummeting. They look around and see countless examples of children being used as weapons from ex wives and everything being taken from them. Men are viewed as optional accessories and not appreciated as their vital roles as fathers. Why would anyone sign up for that? I‚Äôm not saying all women will do that but all women in America have the option. As for solutions, make 50/50 custody of children the standard in all cases where there isn‚Äôt abuse or danger to the child. Eliminate alimony and if there is 50/50 custody, child support wouldn‚Äôt be needed. Have schools and teachers make an effort to include fathers and treat them equally. Make marriage about religious belief and not a legal contract or at the very least, have the man and woman agree on a prenuptial agreement. Lastly, society needs to praise and glorify the family unit. Until this happens marriage rates will continue to decline.",0,2022-04-21T17:27:02Z,2022-04-21T17:27:02Z

Its important to keep in mind that not all of the supporters of the left are evil, for it is written that Satan is the father of all lies, the great deceiver. Many intentionally good people have been greatly deceived. We must attack the ideas themselves which are evil.

Why are we sitting idly by and condoning this great and abominable church to take root amongst our people and amongst our children, to drag them down to hell? We are engaged in civil war right now.

We could begin by making women legally responsible agents again. Before Ronald Reagan developed alzheimers symptoms, he said in an interview that his greatest political regret was signing no fault divorce into law. End no fault divorce.

Change Alimony laws to be equitable and fair. What did the woman bring to the relationship in real terms, not just some emotional companionship bullshit. What did she do to earn a settlement requiring the man to pay her so much? Stop basing alimony and child care payments on his amount of income. No one charges more house rent or greater car payments or charges more for food based on the man's income, so why does she AUTOMATICALLY get a percentage of his income? 

When the marriage is dissolved, he continues to provide her an income, yet she doesn't have to provide any further ""wifely"" services. Completely one sided.

This bothers me because as a Christian, I believe that marriage between a man and a woman and the ‚Äúrearing‚Äù of children (as Ben would say) is probably the most important thing you can do in life.

@peekaboo6622,"The case of Depp and Amber is untertwined with islamic grooming, for political purposes. 

Try seeing it from the 'groomers' perspective.

Through this case, the wickedness of women and the martydom of men is magnified, thereby justifying the treatment of women as being beneath male children.

Remember that islam and communism, which both are present in Russia, for example, want to reign over the USA.  They try to affect our judicial system, culture, society, art, faith, and family structure, judging us from the perspective of their often ancient, diametrically opposed cultures to ours.

Enemies of the US are established in Hollywood, so Depp and Amber are perfect participants.

Enter the influence of Disney, not because of the Pirates series, but because of Amber's lesbianism, counciding with the trans propaganda campaign.

The ailments that infect our faith, families, communities, and culture are injected and boosted via the technology of the internet, and this is the addictive vehicle being used to implement ""The Reset"" / ""The Plan"", which media dutifully echoes.

Boys don't know how to be proper boys and girls don't know how to be 
proper girls, thanks to: our education system, msm, lyrics and videos of Hip Hop/Rap, financial enticement by social media platforms, and the big & small screen - how can they become strong men and women?

@DTB2.0,"Wow, this episode is right up my alley. Just went through our supposed judicial system trying to prove my innocence in a case against my now (as of last week) ex wife. Long story short... we'd been arguing and not getting along for some time and it would sometimes get physical. I never close fist punched her but I did slap her. The instant thst it happened I felt horrible. That was the extent of it. One evening she came out into the garsge where i was working on something i had a utility knife in my hand with the blade facing up. In the same hand i was also holding some wire that i had just cut and a box of heatshrink. She came out intonthe garage yelling and kicked over a space heater (it was January) and she proceeded to get in my face and was yelling. She then went to knock everything out of my hands and when she did she slapped the knife. It cut her hand and required stitches. I took her to the ER and got her fixed up. Well at that point i had enough so approximately 5 days later I packed up everything I could and staged it in the garage where she wouldn't notice  and the next day when I was leaving for work I planned to load it up and leave for good. She was usually a sleep girl when in the mornings because i was the only one who worked and of course she wakes up a d we get into it again and I'm trying to load my stuff and she keeps getting in my way and knocking stuff out of my hands so I pushed her and she tripped over something and she bruised her elbow. She called 911 on me and  I went to work. Apparently first thing they asked is how her hand was cut. She told them that I stabbed her. They then drove to another town in North Fort Worth all the way from Arlington and arrested me at work for Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.   I'm mow on probation for this and have to take battered  women's  classes etc. Not once did anyone ever ask if I did that or not. No one cared.

I see so often couples that should not be together get married because they feel that's what they need/should do. But then when you look at the relationship, they dont align with their  morals and they don't respect each other.

I see time and time women emasculating their partners and men following along because it's socially acceptable to do so now. I value my men and never want my partner to feel like he can't be himself and be a man around me.   

One change I have do to set myself and my partner up right for our future I respect and value him as the man and head of household. We have values shared and when we disagree, we work through it instead of against it. 

We also try to find the best in each other every day. Something that really grounds myself and my partner is we hold values of the first date mentality with each other. Meaning we want to look good for each other, keep good connection, communicate with each other talk about what we are looking for each other, etc. We joke our first date has never ended.",0,2022-04-21T17:18:29Z,2022-04-21T17:18:29Z

If the man and woman love each other that helps but that wasn't really a requirement, in some parts of the world it's still not, nor is consent for that matter. As society moves into the future, marriage slides from being a binding agreement to make babies and into an expression of eternal love for someone else, which is why I'm glad to do it. But I don't just love my girlfriend now, I love her soul forever and believe at a higher level our souls are to merge and become one.

Divorce and remarriage on the grounds of somebody's lack of Christian faith is too subjective to be a standard. Christ considers remarriage to be a form of adultery. If the potential consequence of divorce and remarriage is a life of sin, the risk is too great for me to excuse and condone my choices or that of other Christians.",0,2022-04-21T17:17:44Z,2022-04-21T17:17:44Z

By refusing to budge on these things, my choice pool might be small, but I am much more protected from the disaster of divorce.",0,2022-04-21T17:14:31Z,2022-04-21T17:14:31Z

@caitlinfrugoli2946,"Current ‚Äúdating‚Äù practices with how ‚Äúnuanced‚Äù they are is really a huge problem. It's at the root of why people don't have successful marriages. Courting, dating, etc. all used to be a step towards being married and was a period of preparation for spending your life with your partner. Now it just conditions youth to think that relationships and people are disposable. That concept carries into marriage because we have taught others that their ‚Äúbest life‚Äù is more important than learning to make commitments and keep them. We are teaching people to be selfish and self-centered rather than responsible and respectful of themselves and others.",70,2022-04-21T17:14:02Z,2022-04-21T17:14:02Z
@Briskl,"Thank you so much for highlighting this. I‚Äôm still suffering the consequences of a mentally unstable and emotionally/physically abusive girlfriend. It‚Äôs a long story, but the summary is even though she was arrested in NC for assaulting me when I took her on a birthday vacation for her (I ended up bailing her out for 2K like an idiot) and later having a PPO against her - I was arrested by Chesterfield Police here in Michigan after I had to tackle her because she showed up to my house, walked in, and pointed a handgun at me and threatened to kill me. My landlord is a Chesterfield cop and later found out, to his anger, I was simply arrested because I was the ‚Äúman and bigger than her‚Äù even though I called the police and she fled. Luckily my lawyer got me a deal under a statue that only includes non-reporting probation and then expunges everything - but it turned my entire life upside down and she got away with attempted murder because she was a female.

I‚Äôm going to law school now to hopefully become a criminal defense attorney so that this doesn‚Äôt happen to another man. People need to  realize that women can be equally abusive and as it stands, men, unless you‚Äôre extremely lucky, have no ability to defend themselves.

I hope you see this Crowder and can share this story. I want to help people become more aware - as my case is certainly not unique in the slightest and I‚Äôve heard far worse - such as a deranged ex-girlfriend literally beating a man‚Äôs face to a bloody pulp and he was still arrested because eventually he defended himself.",10,2022-04-21T17:13:57Z,2022-04-21T17:13:57Z

Like if his name is 1st on the car, it's his. If her name is 1st on the house then it's hers because that suggests the house or the car would not be there without the person's credit or cash and that's why their name is 1st?

If I come across I woman I genuinely want to spend my life with, then yes. But I couldn't possibly care less about the certificate or legality of it. It'll be a celebration, as was intended. Friends and families gathered to take part in the long sought joy of such a union. As far as ideas? I'm not well versed enough in the legality of it or anything related. From a very simple perspective - take away the ""incentives"" to get married. It's been turned into, as I previously said, something people do for the benefits.

She should be held accountable for that defamation. Depp is no angel he said some truly awful things in his texts including drowning her, burning her body and F-ing the dead corpse to make sure she was dead. Like I said he's no angel in this.

@andrewmiles2630,"*Edit: Crazy rant.* 

I do not believe in Marriage myself because I dislike the idea of anyone deciding that the woman I choose to be with for the rest of my life and I need to have a ring, ceremony, and a signed piece of paper to make our love real. 

My idea of love is that I give my soul to the woman I am with and a ring or pomp or expensive overdone weddings seem to me like it degrades the love by making ONE SINGLE DAY the ""Most important day of my life"". 

Is it not enough to have the pledge of love when you find it? I am not saying Marriages are bad but that the concept of them today has turned into a white picket fence dream. Everything is like the internet now. Here today and gone tomorrow. 

This is not so much a death of marriage but a symptom of the larger problem, people can freely talk to others across the world. Johnny Everyone grows up in a small town and becomes betrothed to his high school sweetheart but he always loved the idea of marrying a French woman however could never make it there and gave up since his small town has no French women so he settled. 

Then J.E. finds the internet and meets a French woman he never knew existed just 4 hours away and starts to have an affair because he can now suddenly find that French woman. 

Countless reasons I could give as to why the internet and technology ruined people (rather they were not ready for it and now rely on it for everything) but it would take ages. I am not saying Tech. is  the root of evil but it was a catalyst for people to reach out to where they would never have been able to before.

@JosephKulisics,"I want marriage to resemble any other contract. In what other area of contract law can one party dissolve the contract at will and make a claim against the assets of the other party? Would an employer ever hire a worker if the worker could terminate that at-will employment arrangement and sue the employer for continuing compensation over the ludicrous claim to have lost the opportunity to have a different job?

In addition to aligning the understanding of marriage as a contract with every other kind of contract, if the state must have a role, the role should be to establish realistic default contract terms. In marriage, right now, there's practically no obligation for a woman to be physically intimate with a partner. In most states, to sue for fault for constructive abandonment, the failure of a partner to maintain a physical relationship among other kinds of alienation, a man must prove that a woman made no attempt to be physically intimate for at least two years. A single attempt, however badly timed and coldly executed, negates a claim of constructive abandonment. The law is simply unrealistic in its understanding of men's basic needs in marriage: men marry for intimacy, both emotional and physical, and by ignoring the reality of the average man's needs, the law enables women to use the withholding of sex as a cudgel to abuse a male partner and to bait the partner into scratching itches outside the marriage and exposing himself to financially punishing divorce for fault. While a man cannot realistically sue for divorce for fault, a woman typically has many possible grounds for divorce for fault, charges of domestic violence, failure to provide, infidelity, and substance abuse; none of the grounds are unreasonable, but the law is unfair and doesn't represent the common needs of men in marriage.

My wife is foreign, and I tell American men not to give up and to find a foreign wife. In foreign countries, where the legal incentives don't cartelize the sexual economy and encourage women to use their near-monopoly market positions as suppliers of sexual gratification to men to hold men in contempt as nothing more than sources of financial support, women actually seem to like men and enjoy their physical relationships with men. I've seen women in foreign countries look askance at the suggestion that a wife does not have at least some kind of significant duty to be intimate with her husband, and more strikingly, foreign women act like they at least to some degree, enjoy intimacy with their husbands. Far too often, I've seen American women express the absurd, opposite position: American women seem to believe that marriage exists for their benefit and their benefit alone, and any duty imposed upon them by the relationship is a form of oppression. Until the law changes and until the attitude is properly shamed and stigmatized, nothing will change with American women.",0,2022-04-21T17:06:01Z,2022-04-21T17:06:01Z

What's worse is that she has brought up domestic violence allegations and has dismissed them multiple times only to use them as tactics to delay the actual custody battle. It's crazy how obvious the system in California leads towards one direction. One of the few times we were in front of the judge the judge looked at me and she said (without actually looking at any of my documents or my side of the story) ""if I were to make a judgment today based on what I've heard this would not go well for you.""

An ugly woman cooks her meals on time,

@nocturnal101ravenous6,"Marriage is a social contract, it's a religious contract, and it is also a legal contract.
Being a male, I believe in marriage as all 3, you are making a promise and taking an Oath to another person, before your God and before your Government amongst your peers in society, family and such. At one point we had arranged marriages where it was a tool used for gain, due to the power that oath had. 
The problem in society today is people do not operate or believe in those Oaths or promises, In todays society I found it beneficial to not force based on social pressures or to be dominated by your Biology but instead to master yourself, people will complain about Alpha versus Beta Males, but too be a proper member of society you should be both, an unbridled monster and animal when called upon, but also sincere and subservient when needed to those who you made promises to, so you need to be both and know when time dictates what you should and need to be at that time when it is applicable, Its no coincidence that Warriors in history were also musicians, philosophers, poets, and artists.
To be successful this day and age, I think its beneficial to understand you need to be with a person worthy of those promises, and find someone with similar values that beleives teh same as you do because promises work 2 ways, obviously if they don't believe in God and have no fear for their mortal soul they will get away with anything they want, the counterbalance is Government where there are penalties for breaking Oaths to each other and this is where legally I believe we have fallen flat on our faces in society and the sexes are not equal, in which the landscape has become a complete mess with idealisms that have become a complete mess leading to high divorce rates and Children being raised at home without a mother and father properly. That is not Racial or Cultural, a piece of shit in society is a piece of shit. Also you have the problem of people that have ridiculous standards but in no way can they compete on a level that matters, they have nothing to bring to the table in a relationship other than a superficial quality with no depth.
As a male, Either find someone similar with beliefs that will uphold an oath, and maintain a relationship, and make a prenuptial contract to ensure neither one in the advent of separation legally you are protected contractually in the eyes of the government. 
Or just stay single save your money and buy higher class hookers to fulfill biological needs, maintain that trash cannot have you, but, but, never be fully closed, life has a way of throwing curve balls your way, don't settle for trash just because you had to stick your penis in something that night and now you are either trapped or paying child support checks with 2-4 other guys.",0,2022-04-21T16:45:06Z,2022-04-21T16:45:06Z

@jamescassell9851,"As a young man looking at the current marriage statistics. 60% of marriages end in divorce. 80% initiated by the woman. 15% of marriages are unhappy or sexless. That gives me a 75% chance of being divorced with half my stuff taken and paying who knows how much in child support and alamony or being in a sexless, loveless, toxic marriage. Would I like to get married and have a family yes, but with the current state of things the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.  

Top five things I think could help the state of marriages. 
1 get rid of no fault divorce, and do something about the family court system. Preferably desolve it. 
2 hold women accountable for their actions.  If some woman falsely accuses a dude throw the book at her just like they would do if it was a guy. No more slap on the wrist punishments. 
3 women need to stop sleeping around and racking up high body counts. And our culture needs to stop promoting this behavior. Women with higher body counts are statistically more likely to have relationship issues than ones with lower body counts. 
4 less entitlement and not using men like an ATM. Again our culture promotes these behaviors. 
5 women need to stop looking for attention on social media. Personally one of my biggest deal breakers is heavy social media use especially Instagram or snapchat. Cause if they are looking for attention they can just post and get that dopamine hit. If a girl is like that then she gets enough attention and time from other people on the internet and doesn't need any of mine. And I'm not willing to give time or attention that isn't valued. 

With thing as they are now personally I plan to stay single. If I do meet that special someone and we decide to have a long term relationship. I would not get married. No marriage license from the state. There would be a personal contract. Then we would go before God family and friends. Say our vows and pray that we never need to use that personal contract.  
Relations take time and effort on both sides and its something that alot of people forget.",0,2022-04-21T16:44:10Z,2022-04-21T16:44:10Z

@liwendiamond9223,"On the question of how to balance the desire for marriage vs the legal ramifications, I say the point is somewhat moot, because it is impossible to avoid legal ramifications and the destruction of your life through the betrayal of your spouse. If she or he betrays you, you're boned. Even if the laws were fair, your life would still be ruined. Doesn't mean you can't rebuild it, but in the first place no one wants or should have to endure an abusive marriage, or the harsh consequences of a divorce proceedings. Those are tragic outcomes you need to avoid at all costs. And you CAN avoid them, by approaching the question of marriage from a position of strength and wisdom.

It really comes down to not being impulsive in your choice of spouse. Do not rush these things. You have to overlook physical beauty, social and financial pressures, and your own passionate impulses, and ask yourself ""Is this really the soulmate I want to be bound with for the rest of my life?"" Answering that question can be difficult, because we can't read minds and can't predict the future with 100% accuracy, but a few key boxes need to be checked at least before you make the decision to get married.

1. Does she or he share the same Faith as you? If not, the union is virtually guaranteed to fail. The spiritual foundation of a marriage undergirds everything. If one partner has a foundation of solid granite and the other of quick sand, it ain't gonna work out.

2. Do you share an agreement on how many children should be conceived and how they should be raised? Family is the center of a marriage, its the main purpose of it, the central sacrifice and trial. Both parents should be in full agreement on how to handle the matter before they get married, and part of the marital contract should involve holding both of them accountable to that agreement.

3. Beyond the passion of the moment, can you see yourself loving your spouse badly enough to endure Hell for her or his sake? You don't know how bad things can get. Despite your best efforts, circumstances outside of your control can throw a huge spanner in your plans. A war could break out forcing the husband to leave and fight it for years on end, the country could fall into a massive recession and annihilate the career of the main breadwinner, disease could strike one or both partners and turn mere existence into veritable torture. You have to be willing to face it all for your spouse's sake. Life typically does not pull its punches. Something at some point is most likely going to go horrendously wrong and put a lot of stress on the marriage. So ask yourself, do you love your prospective spouse badly enough to endure it all the same and maintain the union?

Above all however, before you ever consider getting married, you need to understand who you are and what you stand for. A child, or the average liberal, but I repeat myself, cannot get married successfully because they are well and truly lost on these fundamental questions of identity and purpose. How can you find true love if you don't know what it is you ought to love? Find God, find yourself, THEN go and seek out your soulmate. I myself am not currently married, but I know what I stand for in life, and I know what to look for in a prospective spouse, because I know myself. I know for instance, that I could never marry a woman who is willing to consider abortion, for ANY reason. I know that I want at least 3 kids and wish to raise them to be good and faithful to God, and I know that above all, faithfulness, courage, honesty and kindness need to define the woman I am to love. Armed with the strength of that knowledge, I know I would rather remain celibate for the rest of my life than engage in a bad marriage with a shitty partner, even if she happens to have a great ass and tons of money or whatever it is our dear Johnny Depp saw in the demon incarnate that is Amber Heard.

@MollyOKami,"Personally, I think that mostly abolishing the concept of alimony (not child support) would help a lot of men be more willing to get married.  As the current system stands, it's practically all women who get it & until she marries again.  This incentivizes women to stay ""single"" (though still dating other men) while punishing a man for having married in the first place.
In our equal society, today, you can liquidate a house/car and split the money (a plan for an ex-spouse who wants the house is detailed below).  Women are more likely to have a job already, so there's not point in getting money (still a form of communication) for practically nothing.  In cases where a spouse is a home-maker, it could be re-written so they could receive alimony, but only for, say 5 years, not until they get married again.  This is time to refresh an education, get ANY job, or, at worst, find a roommate until they can go on their own, again.
The way it is now also makes it harder for men to find a a second chance because, speaking as a woman myself, I would find it hard to marry a guy still making payments to another woman just because she's not interested in cutting-off that spring.  I could _DATE_ him, sure, but I wouldn't want to marry him knowing that now _MY_ support (and possibly paycheck) is going towards the ex-wife‚Ä¶and I don't date unless he's a guy I could see marrying.  I have a three-date rule; the first three are ""noncommittal,"" but, after the third (or a ""mulligan,"" if something unforeseen happens) we need to decide if we're going to be serious or it just wasn't meant to be.

As far as the house or car, here's my _GENERAL_ idea (I'm just spit-balling, here): If either member of the soon-to-be-NOT-couple wants it, they have to basically buy-out the other person half of the item's current value.  Now, to prevent one side from getting a third party to buy the house at a very low price, the spouses get priority over the sale (only to buy it back), regardless of who might want it.  If _BOTH_ should want to keep the house, then they have to make an offer to outbid on the HALF until one decides to take the money over the house.",0,2022-04-21T16:40:44Z,2022-04-21T16:40:44Z

@masonkpiano,"For the Comment Game, I may hold the cake:

I‚Äôm currently 19, almost 20 years old. My ex Girlfriend I had in High school decided to push a rape allegation against me after I Broke up with Her. It was my sophomore year and I was 15 y/o and she was 16 y/o. We dated for 8 months, and we did have sex multiple times with protection and consent. She decided that it was time to ruin my life. At the end of the school year, I was detained and sent a Juvenile Detention Center for 3 weeks as an investigation went underway. Throughout the summer I had to go to court multiple times for speedy trials as things went along. It ended up with me pleading guilty and I had to undergo ‚Äútherapy‚Äù, write an apology letter, and move schools. But wait, that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶ 
The Assistant DA didn‚Äôt even know my ex and I were dating. The family never told him, nor did they mention the other times we had sex and the relationship we had. The thing that convicted me was a Snapchat text where I mentioned the word ‚ÄòRape‚Äô after she pried the answer out of me. Nothing else was as substantial according to the DA. But wait, there‚Äôs more. 
I was a Band Kid and so during the summer before I switched schools, I went to a rehearsal and left my hat there in the band room. The next day, my ex was wearing my hat I left, and a hat which she knows I wore. How weird‚Ä¶ 
Later I found out on social media, she kept posting comic strips about no consent and horrible things aimed to me. 
It was all a lie. She was playing a game, you would think she would be traumatized and never want anything to do with me, but no. It was all a game. But wait, here‚Äôs the best part..

3 months after our breakup, she came out as Trans‚Ä¶ So yes, I f*cked a ‚Äúman‚Äù üòÅ

To the bigger point, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 1/2 years and we are not having sex and waiting to seal the deal before that ever happens. For me to balance my relationship, I don‚Äôt worry myself with the wants of life, instead I just want to be happy and make memories, no drama, no pettiness, just her and I experiencing life together. We‚Äôre still young and living life and getting through college is our goal. No need for the extra stuff",2,2022-04-21T16:40:39Z,2022-04-21T19:30:32Z
@twao5295,"In my opinion, when it comes to marriage among young men, you need to make a change when it comes to their life plan. Most young men want to conform to their woman because they love and care about them. I think it takes it too far however and they can't move on because its hard for a man to lose that feeling of love. I think just setting the foundation of ""this is my plan for my life, are you on board?"" in any relationship from both sides is what needs to happen. Communication is key, especially when its your spouse.
There's also more factors that undermine that question from being asked/avoided, for instance a man being in the military being used for his benefits by his wife. Another one would be parents putting pressure on their kids to be married young. All these things and more have a small impact on those decisions.",0,2022-04-21T16:40:35Z,2022-04-21T16:40:35Z

Men and woman should get married when they have proper understanding of eachother so when they come together they can speak openly about their thoughts and feeling about marriage.
As a woman I believe men are treated very unfairly when it comes to union. 
Marriage contracts should also be a living document and be updated and discussed throughout marriage if one is applied 
MEN SHOULDNT BE AFRAID to use one

@thomasschandel3545,"I had once been woken up by a girlfriend with a punch to the face, she was drunk and upset that I fell asleep before we had sex. There was a couple of other red flags that lead me to calling the police at that moment. The operator could hear her trying to get the phone from me, I was able to keep her at distance with a hard shove. She fell and started over playing that she was injured and crying out for the dispatcher to hear. I simply said, I just defended myself by shoving her away. She heard this and started pleading with me in a lower voice ""please don't do this"", ""why are you doing this"" and ""you're going to get my kids taken away"" dispatcher could hear her still and asked if I could go outside and wait for police, I informed them I was standing on the bed without clothes and would need to move towards her to reach clothes that I wasnt sure that was the best idea. She got up, started freaking out about her kids being taken and cleaning because she had some marijuana out. Giving me my chance to dress and go outside. After they arrived and took statements they told me she was trying to say I started it, I was hitting her and a whole bunch of other things. It could have been really bad for me if they believe her but the police took my side. They asked if I wanted to press charges, I said no, they asked what I wanted to do then, I said give me a minute to call a friend or family member to come by so I can leave because I drank and don't want to drive becuase Im probably over the limit and now my adrenaline has been going for a bit. They instead gave me a ride to a close by relatives house. The drive over myself and the officer had a talk, he pointed out that if she hadn't changed her story or did a better job of keeping it straight chances are I could have been in the back seat right now instead.  Lesson learned. Bonus: had a police offer tell me, ""Yeah unfortunetly, unless she was butt naked crapping on the lawn and howling at the moon when we showed up we can't really take her in custody for being crazy.""",0,2022-04-21T16:30:36Z,2022-04-21T16:32:26Z

Messiah said Himself the only reason for divorce was sexual immorality, which goes way beyond having an affair. It shouldn't be more difficult than that but, fallen world, where every human is selfish so it is harder than that when you do not follow Messiah. The primary change in marriage that I would like to see if having a stay at home parent. I know it is not always feasible for everybody but I think a lot of people make excuses to have both parents working and bring in more money but raising kids should be more important than funding Starbucks, and the latest iPhone accessories. Stop trying to keep up with the Joneses and start trying to be a team and one flesh like God intended. However, that does not mean that children are the sole focus. Your marriage should be. We were given a hierarchy of marriage in the Bible by people much smarter than any of us; Messiah, husband, wife, children. In that order. Children are NOT the focus, they shouldn't be. Your marriage should be the focus and children will follow that fold. Without a good marriage to observe, kids will not have the best life possible. Strong marriage = strong family = strong kids. Kids > marriage = broken marriage.

@demonbynature,"I had an ex accuse me of rape because she was in a bad mood, yet never pressed charges on a 300 lb pacifist.üßêü§î

What I did, is I stopped looking for someone until I was right in my head, I knew what I wanted.

I've always had a keen and accurate gut feeling about people that I surround myself with. Within minutes I could tell if someone was going to be a problem. Except one...

I reconnected with a middle school friend who was legitimately the only woman I could never disrespect her in my mind. I respected her too much for that.

Well we both discovered, after 15 years, that we have liked each other for a long time. yet never expressed it. 

And she is an old fashioned woman in a new world. She willingly wants to be a mother and a homemaker before I ever came around. She finds pride in the act of ""serving"" her husband. 

I had concerns, because I am dominant, but not dominating. But I came to understand why our parents marriages worked, and ours aren't: Because people are not committed anymore. They think marriage is like living with a roommate that can be kicked out anytime, when that is completely opposite of the cade.

@NuclearT3acup,"I think the change has to begin in the courts. 

Let's face it, relationships take work to maintain. As it stands there is largely no incentive for a woman to stay in a marriage once she is married. The stats bear this out. 87 or so percent of divorces are initiated by women.

So in effect, the woman walks out and the man generally has to support her financially, even more so if children are involved.

So over the last two or three decades, as the courts have changed to favor women in divorce proceedings largely due to the feminist movement, men have began figuring out that there is zero benefit for them to marry. Because when the marriage ends, and the odds are high of it ending, the man USUALLY left holding the bag. 

Moreover, it is a common tactic in divorce proceedings for the woman to allege abuse in order to solidify a ""win"". I have heard in many cases this is even suggested by their attourneys.

SO yean, until that broken system changes, men will opt out and an ever increasing rate. As a happily married father of a young boy I can tell you that I will be explaining this dynamic to him when he's old enough.",0,2022-04-21T16:22:41Z,2022-04-21T16:22:41Z

@freebanking,"This is actually pretty cathartic for me to see these cases. I was in an abusive relationship. I was psychologically tormented by my wife for years and made to feel like a weak bitch because I couldn't defend myself for fear of going to prison or having her lie about me to the police. I was so afraid of going to jail or being labelled as a domestic abuser which would ruin all my dream and hard work. I let my ex-wife bruise my face, cut me with her nails, rip my clothing, throw things at me and psychologically torment me for years. I stayed for my children. In the end she just cheated on me throughout the marriage. I found out and we divorced. It's been 4 years and I hardly tried to find a relationship because I'm afraid that will be bad as well. The irony is that after all the abuse I suffered at her hands and after I found out about her cheating on me; on time she was angry at me and she went outside and fell over a bush and cut her chin. I was inside cooking dinner. I took her to the hospital and the staff there treated me like I had attacked her. I was so upset. It was like I had been victimized all over again because the fear I had and that she had lorded over me for years was 100% confirmed true. They forced me out of the room and took her aside to question her for 30 mins about if I had attacked her. I was cooking dinner when she fell over outside! I wasn't anywhere near her! But the whole staff looked at me like I was scum. I wanted to tell them that she abused me for years but I would never tell anyone.

@k.sophiacavallo8858,"I watch true crime channels on YT. One of the best is Emma Kenny. I recently watched a segment on a young girl 17 yrs old, who was tortured to death for 44 days before dying of her wounds. This is one of the worst scenarios I‚Äôve ever heard & will never be able to forget .The boys involved were also 17, & the leader had aspirations of joining the Yakuza. 
The 44 days Junko endured brought tears to my eyes. The leader got 17 yrs which he appealed. The  judge added 3 more yrs to his sentence
A full 20 yrs is what he served. If you can withstand  hearing about some of the worst torture perpetrated against a young girl watch the segment on Junko Furata. 
The parents of the leader  knew what was occurring in their home. They knew what was happening to her, but when police came to investigate they denied having a girl being tortured in their house. I have  no idea why the police didn‚Äôt search the house. But they were responsible for the continued torture of Junko, & should lose their jobs at the very least.",0,2022-04-21T16:18:27Z,2022-04-21T16:18:27Z

@Objective-Observer,"You asked for comments on marriage: here's mine.

I don‚Äôt want more worthless marriages. I want the divorce rate to drop. It‚Äôs not just men who are afraid of marriage; women are avoiding it, as well, and the divorce rate is a big part of their reasoning.

I want Marriage to be clearly defined as a Religious Institution, period. However, I would like churches to establish a contract for couples, that clearly defines the scriptures expectations and requirements of marriage within their church, and the very limited reasons to divorce.  The little bit of counseling we got from two pastors was simply not enough to build a good marriage, because neither of us came from 'good' marriages.

Those who can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to be held to the standards of religion, their unions are for the ‚Äòlegal perks‚Äô the government offers married couples.  Let the Government offer what they can: Civil Unions or Domestic Partnerships, with the requirement of a binding contract.  Not a PreNup, a full fledged contract where the couple clearly define THEIR MARRIAGE.  This type of union is for ANYONE NOT WANTING A RELIGIOUS UNION; INCLUDING MIXED FAITH, HETERO COUPLES.

The Contracts force couples to specifically discuss all the aspects of a life long union, and put that into a binding contract.  Too many kids today only focus on the expensive party.  Fear of marriage stems from fear of the unknown: no one is maintaining any sort of cultural, social, or religious foundations and expectations within marriage.  

My answer is legally binding contracts where both parties discuss what they each want and are willing to do to achieve the success of their union.  Even if they include every 5 years the couple must re-negotiate the terms of their Union Contract.",0,2022-04-21T16:08:28Z,2022-04-21T16:08:28Z

@Godisincontrol1,"My son was trapped (ill explain the whys) because a girl got pregnant. Background her name is Lilly and my son is Brian. I raised my boys to be kind, loving, love Christ, love themselves, teach them like a father would to bait a hook and shoot... I love them both with every part if my body. I've protected them like a mother bear. I taught them to stand up against adversity but Brian was trapped. Brian had 200 Asian friends and ALL of them I cared about. Brian was engaged to a wonderful girl from Cambodia for 5 years and I still miss her. I supported all of his friends or girlfriends choices. Lilly was pregnant and set me up for failure and didn't want me in the equation. One night beautiful white roses came to the apartment. She said, ""these are for you..."". I was shocked and was very thankful. Brian came home and asked where I got them, and I said from Lilly. Apparently, there's some hitman thats my age that still loves her in Florida. Another man she dated was on Switzerland. She dated these men in her teens. She got pregnant and 20 from my son. My son knew that this was concerning but he never showed disrespect to Lilly especially now carrying his baby even though he knew she wasn't honest. Unfortunately I helped him out. He said to me, ""mom I think she's going to leave me for money and please try to find out what's in her phone messages"". Brian wasn't sleeping, or eating and was working a high paying job because I basically paid for his 2 different degrees. He was in the process before Lilly got pregnant to buy a 300,000 house. I took pictures of messages of her phone and one of them said, ""Lilly I will love your baby like my own, remember how I made you feel with my big ____"".... bottom like there were these messages coming from a rich man in Florida that was apparently a hit man and a rich guy in Switzerland... 45 pages of messages I was able to get from her phone. I was in a panic... Lilly found out. So we moved to the new house as I was awaiting housing because I just got on SSDI and renting anywhere you had to be on a waiting list. Lilly knew I did all those pictures and I even called the man in Florida to let him know I was onto him and what he was Planning. The man in Florida bought Lilly a house to leave my son!!!!! Once in the new house all my things were in storage and just essentials I needed and was and am disabled with rods in my back, chronic pain syndrome, arthritis 75% of my body with a bed on the floor in a spar room. I knew Lilly didn't want me there, and I was afraid for my son and my own life,... Lilly drugged me with a rape drug just before my son came home from work, and she said, ""see Brian your mom isn't fit to be around our baby"". Why I knew it was a rape drug is because I was rapped years ago. I let it go for his sake. Then she took one of my pain killers and put it on the floor as I was training a 14 week old puppy for his new child. Brian came home and said, ""here's a pill your mom dropped on the floor""... this was during the day this happened... I kept saying to Brian I didn't drop it she's lieing. Brian looked at me and said, ""mom don't worry your not going anywhere"". He we went down the hall and spoke with Lilly and came back and said, ""mom you have to go back to the apartment...."". My son was putting me into an Empty apartment that had 2 months left on the lease... i had a heart attack and the ambulance came and briught me to the hospital. I told the social worker what was happening.... i had to get to the puppy before lilly came home in fear of what she would do.... i had no way to get home to Brian's hiuse so I ran 8 miles after heart attack. It was a mild one.  They got home and Brian took my bed to his old apartment where i staysd with a 14 week old puppy, no silverware, no plates, empty apartment!!! nothing to cook with 30 below temperatures outside as it was winter here in MN. I was losing my mind with fear, worry, and if I didn't leave she would leave pregnant to Florida. Brian has never seen one of his friends since he met Lilly. His friends call  me to keep me sane and tell me it wasn't my fault. I talked with one of his friends named Natalia and we are friends to this day. I haven't seen my son or met my grandchildren for 4 years. I cry a lot, I've had counseling but nothing I can do. I miss my son and fear I'll never see him again. I know I'll never meet my grandchild. Bottom line according to Brian's friends Lilly keeps her boyfriends away from their mothers from every boyfriend she has had. Natalia knows one of Lillys old boyfriends and he fears Brian's life and mine. So I'm now 61 and feel my oldest son has died and I can't mourn over him because he's still alive that's how I feel. Not one phone call and the holidays are so bad I can hardly take it. Some times during the holidays I want to die but I stop and pray.

Not all women do, but the negative does out weigh the reason. I believe women need to learn to be of class, not of the street. I believe men want to marry, date someone they can value, but with social media I believe women feel a need to devalue and lessen themselves in order to be relevant. Bad news for everyone not everyone has to fit in your life and that is fine. Women a lot of times more than a man seek divorce and devalue or take for granted what is in their lives.

           I was a SAHM and loved it, my husband was in favor and very supportive. He was also very supportive of me working once he grew up and I started to go stir crazy. He's a good man. (I digress) 
           I know my son would also like to have a traditional household, but it's terrifying what can happen to men now days. I'm in no hurry for him to get married and start having babies. I don't discourage dating but I'm definitely not the mom that talks about needing grandbabies nor am I encouraging serious relationships yet. Secretly, I of course can't wait but you guys are right. It's a scary world out there for all men (Penis bearers?).

@UltimateViper,"Best comment for restoring marriage and the foundation... The separation, restoration, demonitization, and foundation of marriage as religious institution. The removal of expectations. Establishing legal union as a legal civil union and not a religious marriage. 


For legal unions ending no fault divorce so that parties to either work to maintain the union prior to separation or prove reasons for separation on grounds of adultery, addictions etc. Create a foundation that legally establishes perjury in domestic court. Legal repercussions for false allegations, weaponizing of the courts, police, and family services. Additional training for lawyers and judges for personality disorders, narcissistic behavior, etc. Default 50/50 parenting with deviation for abuse, addiction,.etc allowing parents to have access to their children and force judges to write decisions including evidence when decisions are made. 

There is an entire TikTok Community about this... Men only want loyalty, dignitity, and repsect from their partners and female empowerment is pressuring women to be free by moving on and breaking marriages leaving men battered broken and bruised. If children are involved as soon as the case is over women often weaponize the police and CPS against father's. Even though women are becoming the fastest growing income section they still pay the smallest amounts of child support and allimony and most commonly do not face jail time or similar penalties as men who are behind on support.",0,2022-04-21T16:03:10Z,2022-04-21T16:03:10Z

@hytopchic2476,There should be punishment for people like Amber Heard. I personally know a girl who left her car running on the side of the road who disappeared for 3 days. When she got home she told her family that she had been kidnapped and raped by 3 men. Those men were arrested. She finally confessed that she made it all up and went to a party for 3 days. She said all that so her parents wouldn't find out. All charges against the men waa dropped and NOTHING was done to her for fabricating the whole story. Think of how the lives of those men could have forever been ruined. Think of the people today that never found out that she lied and still believe those men are guilty.,0,2022-04-21T15:58:22Z,2022-04-21T15:58:22Z

I'd be lucky to keep my rights to my daughter but as for my son, there is a snow balls chance in hell. Shits heart breaking honestly and I have no idea what to do but keep trying. Whats more messed up is I started working literally a day or so after the final hearing and got a home but since the hearing took place already its irrelevant, even though the public defender was terrible and barely did her job. Dont get me started how she kept trying to get me to just give up and sign over my rights.

@tpmiller506,"This is focused on the ""stuff"" focus lately in marriage.
In God's court I'm pretty sure the government isn't a part of marriage. Humanity brought the government into marriage in order to attempt to protect each as though they are separate beings. God says they are one flesh and nothing can separate them but God. Scripture only allows for adultery to separate husband and wife from each other in marriage. Government doesn't follow God in this as the existence of a marriage license intrinsically disregards God's view of marriage for the reasons it, a marriage license, was created. IMHO 
If people need a marriage license to be married then let them bicker over their individual stuff. For those who follow God, let them be unaffected by the government's view. The world is fallen, there is reason to fight for God's kingdom, but understand, as Forest Gump so eloquently put it, ""stupid is as stupid does.""
As for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, there ought to be equal consideration of both sides in marriage, husband and wife, make and female. Men can easily be more physically abusive, but I know of some women who are so emotionally and psychologically abusive, it would drive the man insane to the point of getting harmful even to himself.",0,2022-04-21T15:52:47Z,2022-04-21T16:00:03Z

@Skitdora2010,"There were studies in England that showed that the lower the social value of the woman the more she hits, just like drunk men are sad men who drink to escape and when they drink some get abusive. They are people with low value and shitty lives. But studies showed that a woman hitting another woman to flirt with a man did raise the value of the ugly woman to men looking to date and the guy would choose the hitter over the slightly more attractive less aggressive female because the violent woman seemed to have greater value at first. So, hitting is a flirting technique of low value women to advance their dating pool. It does get the ugly women men.",0,2022-04-21T15:52:28Z,2022-04-21T15:52:28Z

Crowder's just on Johnny Depp's side because he despises the me-too movement. But this guy is a horrible man and he's done way worse than just abused women.

This what we do know about many Males being assaulted by the female spouse. 
Cops don't take much value in arresting the Female Opponent in many of these ""domestic"" assaults. Now had this been Johnny Depp assaulting his female spouse. The Cops are all over you and worse. 
But in this case, its the Female Spouse who is doing the assaulting. When this happens, many Cops say you are just Pu$$y Whipped so stand up for yourself. 
That is the problem, Males can't, today -- stand up for yourself because as soon as you lift a hand, or imply potential violence. Holy Hannah will you be taken apart by the Family Court System of Justice. If kids are involved, it gets even more worse. 
But in many cases of Domestic Assault, even when the Male is the victim of the assault. It's YOU folks the Male person removed from the home. It's you the male who gets denied access to your kids. It's you the male whom has to be interviewed and screened by Child Protective Services before even getting structured access to your kids. 
Johnny Depp has rights too, but before the Female Kangaroo Court, he is a dead man walking. Women can walk on water before Domestic Issues in courts. You rarely and I mean rarely see Men whom get assaulted by their spouse see anything done to the Female perp.",0,2022-04-21T15:47:31Z,2022-04-21T15:47:31Z

Even prenuptials are regularly thrown out by courts. Essentially what Id like to see on the legal side of marriage is equality to be reestablished when divorces do occur. If women can do their own thing when single why if people breakup is alimony still a thing? Splitting half the marital assets I get as well as child support (provided joint custody isn't determined). Our constitution secured our right against endentured servitude and divorce often seems to defeat that. Also doesn't help men's confidence in marriage when with the current system 80%+ of woman are the ones filing and when children are involved the courts typically give primary custody to the mother, dads very often get 2 days a week and in other cases 2 days a month, at least when joint custody isn't agreed upon.

@moosesimpson8625,"Crowder, you're completely off base about marriage. There are 2 views to consider with marriage, religious and legal (non religious/ worldly), and both come to the same conclusion.
Marriage is about resources. It is not about the Disney version of ""love"" as you and many claim. It is about security, prosperity, procreation, etc, and resources determine all of those.
From a religious perspective, we are to love all, even our enemies. God never says to love one more than another, we are to love all. But we don't marry all. In fact, you become one in marriage. The order of God is specific; God in Christ, Christ in man, man over woman, and woman over children. The man is responsible for not only the woman's salvation but also her sins, her security, providing for her, etc. Men are to provide for women and women are to marry men that can provide for them. It is a public contractual relationship even with God as an arbiter. Women are to submit to their husband. Men have fallen and as a result women are out of control. The man receives appreciation and praise from his wife which he passes on to Christ and God. Its a flow. Gods love and resources pass to Christ and then man, to women them children. Praise, submission, and trust goes the opposite direction. 

In the worldly practical aspect of marriage it is specifically about resources and protection. Women marry and desire the man that can provide for her. From the beginning of time this has been the case. She can choose the cavemen that doesn't have a cave or hunting skills and die with him of exposure or starvation or choose the one that is successful, thrives, and is capable of passing on to offspring. That simple concept has not changed in today's world. We have simply destroyed it with culture and a false idea of what love is. Abandoning our true instincts, desires, and feelings and convincing ourselves that we desire society's ideas and approval. If ""love"" is the deciding factor we end up with endless dating periods because feelings come and go. Love is not a feeling but we are told it is today. We also end up with high divorce rates, arguments over resources, and women who see an opportunity to advance their lot in life by taking a man's resources rather than having them provided for her. 

There's not a simple fix and it would require a lot of things that would be wildly unpopular by this new secular, evil, wave of progressives. The workforce might need an overhaul, the state should either get out of marriage completely or it needs to recognize that one party, typically the man, has most of the responsibility and therefore has less of the reprocessing when the other party walks away. Women file for over 80% of all divorces. Men and women both need to have clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the marriage that are recognized by the culture and society. A failed marriage cant be a victory for either party.",0,2022-04-21T15:45:21Z,2022-04-21T15:45:21Z

@jamespurdie1519,"Question of the day answer. As far as marriage goes the only way to fix it is by having two kinds of marriage. 

1. More of a civil union. Only requirement is a prenup. If things don't work out the prenuptial is followed to the T unless a crime was committed. This would include visitation and child support. 

2. A covenant marriage. Where there can't be a prenup. However if one party files for divorce the state immediately takes 1/3rd or of all your stuff... house, savings, business, retirement... 1/3rd of everything. Then the state comes is and devided everything the rest between the two parties.",2,2022-04-21T15:39:43Z,2022-04-21T15:39:43Z

We must separate state, from marriage. It's so easy to get married, but try getting divorced. We also need to stop ruling cases on biases, as to say: the woman gets the house and the kids because she's the mother. Yeah, but the kids need their father too, and the bias is just super disgusting. Men get screwed in court so bad, and I think women who falsely accuse men of a crime, when proven false, need to do the sentence that the man was going to do if true. Because it ruins lives.

@therainbowbody,"‚ÄúWhat kind of changes do you want to see to the institution of marriage to bring it back to where it is supposed to be?‚Äù

There are important legislative elements to this, but I want to first  focus on the philosophical and cultural elements. Culture is upstream of politics, as we say.

Marriage has always been a religious process‚Äîligare, the root word, meaning to bind. What is it about man and woman that would need binding together? Note, I am not talking only on the pragmatic level (kids, finances, caring for the elderly of the family) but on the level of the psyche and the emotions. The answer is, we  - particularly on the right - need strong familial/communal ties in order to win the culture war.

 What I would say is missing is the education - and the answer to the culture war seems it‚Äôs always education - of the classical function of man, woman, and what happens to the two of them in a holy matrimony‚Äîtwo becoming one. The benefits for both the individuals and community of psychological growth, and personal power, and sovereignty that come out of a healthy marriage need to be made glaringly evident on the right. We must continue to motivate people towards caring about the responsibility of the health of the psyche/soul and the health of the family,  as they beget the health of our nation. We must make dramatically clear how marriage is centerfold. 

The way this is incentivized is by way of the continuing advance of the populist philosophical movement on the right. You can‚Äôt trust legacy media, big tech, big pharma, etc. but what can you lean on in dark times? The power of the family structure as it relates to the greater community, I.e. the sacred bond of marriage. 

We are on the right track, our values have stood and will stand the test of time, but we must keep going. The institution of Marriage cannot exist in a healthy state while the left is mainstream‚Äîto fix the institution of marriage, we must grab and hold on to the reigns of our culture.",4,2022-04-21T15:25:31Z,2022-04-21T15:28:39Z
