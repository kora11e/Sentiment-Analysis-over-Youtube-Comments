It amazes me the West chose to ignore India's Modi meeting Netanyahu in *June 2023* _pledging to replace Gaza internment camp Workers with trafficked ln'dian labor!_ But that's what they did to Gaza, until in *September 2023,* when Blinken cut off aid to Egypt used to feed and care for now penniless starving Gazan population!

That outrage led to 7OCT Intifada and gave Netanyahu _causus belli_ to lockdown and then mvrder 50,000 Gazans, _while ln'dia is busy supplying all ls'real's labor now, in taking over Northern Gaza!_ *ln'dia offshoring is already stealing $200,000,000,000 a year in good jobs from Americans!*

Here we go in Syria again! Like Afghanistan, where Hillary wrote their Constitution, designed their Currency, their Flag, then with  DDR Deep State pals, _scored the Afghan National Anthem! _

'Tis the land of Afghanistan,
'Tis the pride of every Afghan.
'Tis the land of peace and the sword,

@eliasbshara3647,"Hey Ben.. 
I'm Syrian. And based on my knowledge, i will be commenting throughout the video. I like the fact that you on the contrary to almost everyone in the west knows the religious essence of the fight.
I think you might have missed the involvement of saudi Arabia ü§î coz they sent so many terrorists throughout the years. 300k deaths is a really moderate estimation.. we really don't know how many are dead or ""missing"" coz it is a thing in Syria that you can vanish of the face of the earth and not be announced dead. 10% Christians is a little bit high coz it was true in 2010 rn it's barely 3%. As a person who comes from a Christian family, we weren't systematically marginalized -at least to my knowledge- by al-assad forces because they pretty much knew that we aren't a threat and we wouldn't be fighting with the ones who are planning to slau**ter usüòÖ. Although they might have used some small villages of Christians as a bait for the Islamic groups where they would let them and retreat for few days.. ofc no need to tell you what those did in there.. and then al-assad army will take back the village and use what happened in the media to show the minorities how it could end up for them if they don't support him. Rn it's total and complete chaos. They don't know what could happen on the ground to people and especially minorities. But the question that I want to ask you is do tou think Israel would let the Islamic groups start an Islamic state on their northern borders coz that's very dangerous for them? In addition to that, it is the perfect time for Israel to stabilize the Middle East in a way that helps their gouls for the area with all the major forces who are causing problems effectively gone or incapable of doing anything as you mentioned.
Overall i think you are very well informed. Almost as if you actually live in the middle eastüòÇ thank you for the video, it is very important for people in the west to understand this the way you do, for their OWN GOOD.",0,2024-12-11T17:36:16Z,2024-12-11T17:37:08Z

@LastJewishSamurai,Some good came of it. The Russians and Iranians out and weakened. Unfortunately with multiple Islamic factions involved and ultimately looking for control without a clue how to run a country there is little reason for optimism. I suspect ultimately the Turks will impose their will. They want the Syrian refugees out of Turkey and a peaceful Syria on their border is to their benefit as long as they have influence. Clearly they provided support to the rebels who took over. They both are primarily Sunni so maybe it can sort of work. One thing for sure it will be a mess for a long time. Hopefully they are all sick of the violence and willing to compromise for peace. However looking at the history of the Middle East that seems unlikely. Especially because of the death cult they belong to.,0,2024-12-09T15:56:46Z,2024-12-09T15:56:46Z

I know it's normal since this channel is an echo chamber fueling that sort of hatred against my people. I've only one thing to say which is go learn history and stop your ignorance. In the past, from 600 until 1800 there were many great Muslim civilizations and empires; we built cities, participated in the scientific progress, rule of law, etc.  Still, I need to remind you that even today many Muslim nations are doing pretty well. Unfortunately, for many other not so much. Colonialism which started from the 19th until 1950s, for most countries, is responsible for that brutal decline, and its consequences are still felt until. Hopefully, we will come back to greatness yet again and that will be great news for everyone.  Peace in the world, and prosperity for everyone would stop mass migration which is destroying not only your civilization but also ours. And after all, peace is important as we share the same planet, and none of us want to see their kids go die in foreign lands for unreasonable causes that only fit the interests of a certain elite's archetype. Only a mutual respect from both sides can save us. So do better and be better. There's no need for these senseless wars between Muslims and Christians.",1,2024-12-09T15:22:56Z,2024-12-09T15:22:56Z

@flyingdutchman7585,"The CIA is behind and has been behind this since 1956, but the most recent interventions began after the proposed Qatar to Turkey pipeline.  War against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. In 2009, soon after Bashar Assad rejected the Qatar pipeline, the CIA began funding opposition groups in Syria. In 2011, the U.S. joined France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and England to form the ‚ÄúFriends of Syria Coalition,‚Äù which formally demanded the removal of Assad. The CIA provided $6 million to Barada, a British T.V. channel, to produce pieces entreating Assad‚Äôs ouster. Saudi intelligence documents, published by WikiLeaks, show that by 2012, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were arming, training and funding radical Jihadist Sunni fighters from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to overthrow the Assad‚Äôs Shia allied regime. Qatar, which had the most to gain, invested $3 billion in building the insurgency and invited the Pentagon to train insurgents at U.S. bases in Qatar.  Remember, every war we are in has to do with Oil or Gas and this one was no different.  However, once again we will see that groups the US created (ie - Taliban, ISIS) will prove to create more problems for the US and the World, but don't worry, the US Military Industrial Complex always wins in this scenario.",0,2024-12-09T11:26:27Z,2024-12-09T11:26:27Z

@opposed2logic,"one thing that people who arent syrians or havent lived in syria understand is that before the civil war assad was actually very popular in syria, he was a source of pride for most people. even though he was an alawite and as a result a minority of syrian society dominated a lot of its spaces, people still liked him. you could hear cab drivers talk about how great he was, talk about his education, etc. when things started to go wrong and there was a tv appearance planned people were convinced assad will fix everything with his speech, because he is a great and unifying man.

now we all know how that went (or i guess many dont, but basically he didnt address the issue at all and then it eventually grew into full scale civil war).
the thing is though that even though assad was a dictator under him syria prospered when compared to other countries in the region. they were heavily embargoed but instead of becoming fully reliant on iran and russia they opted to primarily aim to create their own industries to address that issue, like having a domestic pharmaceutical industry etc. it went so far that when the west decided to end its embargo there were almost no bargaining chips left, they couldnt form friendship by just offering to start trading because syria had more or less solved their problems, instead they ended up being offered very very very good deals with the west which of course opened up their economy even more, and they played both sides of the field by maintaining good stance with the west and the east. under assad most persecution that is so common in this part of the world ended too, you were allowed to be christian, to be a shiia muslim, to be a sunni muslim, etc, etc. the only thing you really couldnt do was mess with the party, but compared to the region this was actually a lot of freedom. the country was modern, had flourishing cities, it was mostly peaceful and safe, overall it was actually a good place to live and work under assad.

is dictatorship wrong? obviously. in an ideal world they would be a free democracy like western countries (or preferable better) but an ideal world is not a realistic world. realistically at the time they had it about as good as one could hope for, and then to realistically wish for more would be to look towards the future and slow change.

people who think assad being ousted will cause positivity for syria has never been to syria and never lived there. this will not make syria better. the people who took over are terrorists that are far worse than assad, assad was an evil man who were willing to wield evil as his tools to keep people in check, but when there were no political unrest he generally did not wield that evil. the new people are people who will wield evil as a tool to do everything, all the time. expect syria to become like lebanon now. the educated and informed among us know what happened to lebanon. it was called the jewel of the middle east, it was the progressive stronghold in a regressive region, it was modern, it was developing fast, it aspired to be like european countries, it stood tall above its neighbors. then hezbollah came and started their civil war and took over most of the power, and ever since lebanon has not seen a single thing get better, instead things all got worse. its been decades and nothing has improved, its stagnant, its regressing, its a shithole. syria will see same fate. the civil war in syria took what more or less was a jewel of the region and turned it to poopshit and now with a terrorist group that is a splinter cell of al qaeda taking over it will never ever get better again and 50 years from now we will see syria look like it does today, or worse, with no improvement.

people dont realize that before the civil war syria was a modern country that you could live a good life in even if you were an american or european.",0,2024-12-09T11:14:34Z,2024-12-09T11:14:34Z

@Letsplay222,"Ben is one delusion Neocon. Hezbollah isn't destroyed by a long shot nor is Russia incapable of doing the same air sorties in Syria it did during the 2010s. Iran only ever provided military advisement and limited monetary and arms support. But none of those entities were willing to fight for Assad's regime in place of the Syrian military. They were only ever supplementary. The Syrian military was appropriately expected to be the main fighting force to repel  the ""terrorists"" Al Qaeda. The Syrian military melted away because Syria the country is under heavy sanctions by the United States and because their lucrative oil fields and agricultural areas have been confiscated by the United States military. No money to pay soldiers means soldiers don't fight. It's that simple. 

The ""terrorists"" were trained by Ukrainians, which means they were trained by NATO, which means they were trained by the United States. They are not native to Syria. They are primarily Turks and other Central Asians. They were armed, paid and directed by the Turkish military. Which basically means that Syria is now part of a Turkish Empire of sorts. So in other words Ben's Neocon cohorts replaced Iran, a country that is not Imperialistic in outlook, with Turkey, a country that is very Imperialistic, as the Islamic power bearing down on Israel. This didn't go according to plan. Ben's people were hoping that there would be a massive Civil War in Syria where the Sunnis (Turks, Al Qaeda) and Shiites (Iran, Hezbollah) along with Russia all committed and lost vast amounts of resources in battle. Instead there was no fight and now Sunni extremists run Syria with barely a shot fired. Incidentally, Sunni is also the religion of the Palestinians whom Israel is currently committing unspeakable war crimes against. Wonder how that will play out.

According to the latest reports, the new Syrian government will Russia to keep its Syrian bases, so Russia hasn't lost anything. It remains to be seen whether Iran can maintain their land bridge of support to Lebanon, though according to them they primarily supply Lebanon via the Mediterranean Sea. So not ideal for Iran but not catastrophic. Hamas just inflicted several more IDF casualties yesterday, same as the day before, and the day before that, no end in sight, so I don't know where Ben gets the idea that Hamas has been destroyed.",1,2024-12-09T11:02:16Z,2024-12-09T11:02:16Z

@Victor-ue1gz,"Isaiah 17:1-3

Proclamation Against Syria and Israel
17 The burden[a] against Damascus.

‚ÄúBehold, Damascus will cease from being a city,
And it will be a ruinous heap.
2 [b]The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
They will be for flocks
Which lie down, and no one will make them afraid.
3 The fortress also will cease from Ephraim,
The kingdom from Damascus,
And the remnant of Syria;
They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,‚Äù
Says the Lord of hosts.

Perhaps this time, the destruction of Damascus (Israel to obliterate it due to Syria's chemical weapons stored?) will render it unlivable and never restored like previously?

Further continuing, scripture says:

4 ‚ÄúIn that day it shall come to pass
That the glory of Jacob will [c]wane,
And the fatness of his flesh grow lean.
5 It shall be as when the harvester gathers the grain,
And reaps the heads with his arm;
It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain
In the Valley of Rephaim.
6 Yet gleaning grapes will be left in it,
Like the shaking of an olive tree,
Two or three olives at the top of the uppermost bough,
Four or five in its most fruitful branches,‚Äù
Says the Lord God of Israel.

Ben is also idiotic when it comes to continue arming Ukraine, that war is lost and never had a hope of succeeding. The sanctions were meant to defeat Russia not the war in Ukraine. The breakup of Syria is good for Israel but not good for Christians and secularists living in Syria. This was a US backed coup against Assad which will come back to hurt Europe in the short term and the USA in the long run. You don't ally with Al Qaeda/ISIS/Al Sham (or Turkey) and expect a good outcome. However, now that it has happened, it is vitally important that the regime in Iran is toppled before they develop nuclear weapons. The best outcome would be for Russia to finish the job in Ukraine, take Odesa and all of Eastern Ukraine, and stop the US neo-con advance in that region and on the other hand for Israel to win their own war against global Islam and for the regime in Iran to collapse. That would give a good balance in the world.",0,2024-12-09T08:16:28Z,2024-12-09T08:31:04Z

@sameehali7045,"I am Syrian druze (Minority) living in Damascus, 
What ben said here wasn't all lies , but lots of half truths 

Golani was with Alqaida when he was still young 
But he rebelled against them and fought them and they called him a traitor.
Now this means nothing 
A terrorist fighting another terrorist.

This was my veiw and the druze community's veiw.
As a druze We are the last people on earth who would want an islamic law 

During the war we knew that if isis or alqaeda enters 
They will behead us in the streets

Even non extremist basic Islamic sharia law can be oppressing to us in some way


Al golani said that he changed now and he saw that isis were evil and thats why he rebeled against them and the isis thing is from the past 

This can be true ( a man can change) but its still talk and doesn't prove anything 

But now ? 
Holy shit its really different 

They took over aleppo, homs, Damascus 
And they didnt kill any innocent ,they didnt raid homes and they didnt enter civilian buildings , conflict areas were kept away from civilians even with the army they took most bases with negotiations , 
And the soldiers who put thier weapons down were safe and returen to thier homes

No executions in Steets
No ethnic cleansing of anysort 

We didnt believe it untill we saw it 
Unlike the isis scums who were mostly afghan and iraqis and saudi and extremists 

Those guys are syrians 
We saw them being nice to the people of aleppo 
 
They entered and didnt even shoot in the air to not scare the people 

My Christian friends in homs told me They entered the city and told them they can stay if they want and they are free to leave if they want also 

No Christian that I know or saw on social media in all syria got assaulted by them 

Hell they even entered all public institutions without stealing anything

They did some mistakes 
Like freeing the normal prisoners and criminal along with assad detainees

But nothing related to islamic extremism

For the fist time in 14 years we weren't scared of gunshots
 
We knew they will enter capital and we slept just fine , knowing tomorrow we will celebrate


The druze came from south to Damascus and talked with HTS

Wich shows they are wiiling to talk 


Now can they turn back to being extremists ? 
Yeah that's possible 
But now we are cautiously hopefull 

We are done with  worshipping public figures only time will tell how good they are 

But syria is different from lybia and other examples , its too diverse to be ruled by one religion

@turbo32coupe,"I have personal knowledge of the chemical weapons in Syria.  They came from Iraq.  Hussein sent them to Syria for safe keeping before the Gulf War.  These weapons, sarin and tabun gas were made in Iraq during the Iraq/Iran war.  We gave Saddam the precursors and the Germans gave him the equipment to produce these gases.  Fortunately, the purity of his products was low.  Sarin and tabun gas degrade over time unless they are over 90% pure.  His was about 40%.  Saddam later used these weapons on the Kurds.  By now these weapons should have degraded enough to be less effective than conventional bombing.  They are now only useful against civilian populations or as a terrorist weapon.  Nothing positive comes from providing weapons to dictators.  Read ""Biohazard"" or ""Saddam's Bomb Maker"" if you want more information.",0,2024-12-09T01:22:43Z,2024-12-09T01:22:43Z

They most likely do not have a favorable view of Hezzbolah, Russia, ISIS, and Iran. The Russian bases in Iran are not only used to secure a presence in the Med but also as their gateway to Africa.

@tiluriso,"6:11 - Laughable if it weren't acutely sad and disturbing, this 'rebel leader' is a bonafide  terrorist who can't decide if his pious Islamism should be invested in Al Qaeda or ISIS, so he decided for both...'just in case, you know?'...Seems it can potentially  be  like Iraq, bad w/ Saddam, worst w/o him?

No doubt it's good because the arms corridor from Iran into Lebanon is gone, but the idea of an Al Qaeda/ISIS affiliated  terrorist in charge doesn't seem be any better in the long run.

@alphabears6342,"The problem is that Assad army couldn‚Äôt use the biological weapons because the base that had a surplus of biological weapons and materials were in the rebel hands. Obama‚Äôs administration used that as an excuse to get involved in the Syrian civil war which probably was funded by the CIA. Also, Hezbollah is not defeated by Israel unlike what Israel says. Hezbollah lost its leadership and its leaders have been wiped out. Hezbollah is still there in hiding just as ISIS did all these years before they stroke. Also, Russia was asked to help Assad by the Assad regime. The Russians helped Assad mostly in wiping out ISIS in Syria. Now that Assad is not there, Syria is going to be like Lybia after Gadaffi was killed were you have multiple generals calling themselves the leaders of Lybia. That is what is going to happen creating another void were terrorism would take advantage of the situation. Israel is like the US administration. All words with full of lies.

@farahalshoofi1778,"I‚Äôve been seeing many people comment on the Syrian conflict, and while I appreciate it, I also appreciate the information being passed around should at least be factual. I‚Äôm not trying to be hateful, you are entitled to your opinions, but those are notes I have from video:
1:41 : Here, you called the conflict a ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù. That is objectively false, as the people were not fighting against each other. Calling it as such sells the negative narrative that the dictatorship tried to sell for so long in order to divide Syrians.
1:58 : at this point, you are saying that the regime was fighting against Sunni Muslim militants. That‚Äôs an incredibly harmful misconception. The regime pushed the idea that they were protecting the minorities of which are Christians, druze, etc. From Sunni muslim ‚Äúterrorist groups‚Äù. In consequence, Sunni civilians, not militants, civilians, were being mutilated, killed, and arrested into torture camps such as the Sidnaya prison which is considered a modern day barbaric human slaughterhouse. And, for the record, many Christians and Druze and other minorities were also being killed by the regime should they criticize it, I would know since I belong to the minorities he and his father vowed to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù
5:44 :  Calling the resistance a terrorist group is honestly incredibly disheartening. Calling them terrorist groups indicates that they have been terrorizing the people thus far, which is the opposite of what‚Äôs happening currently on earth. They have made it clear to the regimes army that those who don‚Äôt resist won‚Äôt get harmed, and urged people to drop their weapons and return to their families, as they no longer needed to fight for a regime that throws them out for dead. They have been providing aid in terms of food and medicine to civilians in Syria, especially in Aleppo which is has a large Christian demographic. Overall, they have been helping everyone, and people are satisfied with it. In truth, the Sunni civilians were the ones terrorized in Syria by the Alawaite regime. The men and boys fighting currently are the children of Syria, who are fighting for Syrian liberation. Yes, the current person leading the resistance is a terrorist ‚Äúpreviously‚Äù associated with ISIS, and believe me all of us Syrians are worried for the results of this overthrow of the dictatorship. Nonetheless, I do not believe he has a chance of enforcing a rule like the taliban, specifically because of the diversity of religion in the country.

Overall, your analysis is quite astute, and you‚Äôre right. The situation sucks. We‚Äôre fed up with the dictatorship and wish to live on our own terms, and overthrowing it was the very first step to ensuring that. Yes, there‚Äôs a very possible chance that they‚Äôll just lump someone in Al Assad‚Äôs place to play the same role, however with the current feelings going on in Syria across all Syrians, regardless of religion, they won‚Äôt accept it. It is precisely because of that that a lot of us are being optimistic, despite how grim the situation is.

Nonetheless, it is still a happy day for many in Syria as political prisoners are being freed, people who were thought to be dead are returning to their families, and spirits are high. Even if the situation is grim, it is still a happy result. All will depend on how it plays out.",10,2024-12-08T23:08:32Z,2024-12-08T23:08:32Z

@janusium,"Revolutions, those moments of profound upheaval and seismic change, are paradoxically bound by the very ideologies they claim to shatter. The cry for freedom, echoing across the streets, carries with it the chains of the culture that forged it. A revolution is not born ex nihilo; it is the child of its time, its dreams sculpted by the hands of history, its fury ignited by the kindling of inherited beliefs. Even as it demands the death of tyranny, it resuscitates the ideology of the tyrant‚Äôs world‚Äîaltered, yet unmistakably familiar.

The French Revolution, for instance, is a symphony of contradictions. It shouted ""liberty"" while silencing dissent, exalted ""reason"" while guillotining the unreasonable. The Enlightenment‚Äôs radiant ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity were its guiding stars, yet they cast long shadows. De-Christianization swept through France, but it was no true abandonment of faith‚Äîit merely replaced one altar with another, the God of Abraham with the goddess of Reason. It was a secular zealotry that mirrored religious fervor, a war against tyranny that birthed the tyranny of terror.

The Bolshevik Revolution, too, was an echo of this dialectic. Marxism promised the withering away of the state, yet it built a leviathan in its place. The revolutionaries, armed with the utopian vision of classless equality, waged war on the old order only to create a new one, cloaked in red banners and heavy with bureaucracy. It was a revolt against oppression that wielded oppression as its tool, a call for freedom that demanded unyielding loyalty to the party. Even as it sought to rewrite history, it carried the ink of tsarist autocracy in its veins.

In Iran, the revolution of 1979 unfolded as a sacred paradox, a rebellion rooted in submission. Shia Islam, with its rich tradition of resistance and martyrdom, infused the uprising with spiritual fire. The Shah, a symbol of secular modernity, was overthrown not in the name of worldly emancipation but of divine justice. The theocracy that followed claimed to break with the past, yet it was steeped in the very authoritarianism it had decried. The sword and the scripture became inseparable, a dance of salvation and subjugation.

Christianity, too, has left its indelible mark on revolutions within its domain. The English Civil War was a battle not just of muskets but of metaphysics. The Puritans, wielding their Calvinist theology like a blade, declared war on both a king and a cosmos that defied their God. They sought to dismantle tyranny in the name of divine sovereignty, only to construct a commonwealth heavy with its own piety and dogma. The revolution‚Äôs fire consumed the crown but left its ashes scattered across a deeply divided land.

Across the Atlantic, the American Revolution married Enlightenment rationalism with biblical prophecy. It was a revolt that imagined itself as a new exodus, the colonists as God‚Äôs chosen people escaping the Pharaoh of British rule. Jefferson‚Äôs pen may have etched secular ideals into the Declaration of Independence, but the sermons of the revolutionaries were drenched in scripture. Freedom was framed as God‚Äôs gift, rebellion as His will, a theology of defiance that both liberated and constrained.

Even in the 20th century, revolutions in Christian societies bore the marks of their faith. Liberation theology in Latin America wove together Marx and Jesus, the cross and the hammer, in a tapestry of redemption and revolt. Priests became revolutionaries, preaching sermons of justice while wielding the sword of revolution. The fight against dictatorships became a holy war, a battle for both the body and the soul. Yet this synthesis of ideologies, so powerful in its vision, often stumbled on its own contradictions, entangling salvation with violence, liberation with hierarchy.

Revolutions, then, are oxymoronic creatures‚Äîradical yet conservative, liberating yet constraining, destructive yet deeply creative. They seek to annihilate the old world but cannot escape its embrace. They are battles for justice fought with the weapons of injustice, cries for freedom that echo with the cadence of submission. In their pursuit of the new, they are haunted by the ghosts of the past, their dreams shaped by the ideologies they claim to transcend. To understand a revolution is to see it not as a rupture but as a mirror‚Äîa reflection of the world it seeks to overthrow, distorted but unmistakable.",1,2024-12-08T23:00:36Z,2024-12-08T23:00:36Z

@JPJ432,"Fun Fact on Russia: It was Russia who saved The Union during the American Civil War as they sent their Navy to San Francisco and New York when England and France were just about to enter the war on the side of the Confederates since London created the Confederates. France was already in Mexico making a spear head movement to resupply the Confederates and to open up a Pacific Theatre and to create a port in California. England already amassed 11,000 troops and growing stationed at their Northern Confederacies border now called Canada ready to open a Northern Theatre to divert Union troops away from their Southern Confederacy then to attack The Unions naval blockade. The Union would have been completely destroyed and annexed by those two great powers leaving the Confederates to exist as either a puppet state of London or to be fully brought back into the fold of the British Empire. 

London was already courting (threatening/bribing) other countries to get involved like Spain while Russia was in talks with Prussia to ally with incase London was to intervene. 
Seeing all of this Tsar Alexander II wrote a letter to Queen Victoria saying ‚ÄúIf you enter in this war it will be a casus belli for all out war with the Russian Empire‚Äù. The stage was set for the 1st World War and Russia stopped it.

There is also a memorial in San Francisco for the hundreds of Russian sailors who came off their Asiatic fleet ships that died while helping the city put out a fire that threatened to lay waste to it during the War.",2,2024-12-08T22:05:41Z,2024-12-08T22:05:41Z

We are sick and tired of every finger who tried or is still trying to poke yet another civil, ethnic or religious conflict to ensure instability for ten more years.. The Isreali reaction after the fall of Assad is justifiable for the people only and only if it guarantees the suppression of weapons spreading, and somehow de-escalating the chaos.. Iran is out now.. Asad is a refugee in Moscow (hilariously ironic, and we demand they send him back for justice).. all the names you mentioned are there only because of the power vacuum that Asad ensured to happen after his coward escape.. We as the Syrian people will not in any means accept another dictatorship under any title.. Especially when the media labels the ""good"" and ""evil"" serving thier funder's agenda.. The majority aren't Islamists btw.. And many people even sunnies themselves are worried if radicals took control. 
Damascus today fell without a fight..
Now is our chance as free people to end the age of tyranny and live together no matter the background, beliefs or ethnicity.. Just to live with each other and our neighbors in peace ..hopefully justice will take it's way..
We are trying our best not to have another Iraq or Libya or Afghanistan..

@JasmineSinclair-i3n,"Im not going to defend a dictator, but if Assad is guilty of war crimes, so is President Obama. 

Years ago, because of the cruelty of Assad's police, his citizens rebeled, sparking a civil war. President Obama sympathized with the uprising initially, but the citizen rebels were being slaughtered by the bombs, and even some chemical weapons by Assad's forces. So in their desperation, they accepted the help of an army that also had religious extremists (a relative concept). So Obama then labeled all the rebels as enemies. The US in defense of Assad, slaughtered tens of thousands, turning the rebel army into ashes. He also invited Russia into Syria.

As an American, I believe war crimes by Americans should be punished. Maybe, Obama's slaughter of the rebels fighting for their freedom, was just evil, not a war crime, but he ordering the murder of US citizens by drones, and Biden's slaughter of women and children by drone in Afghanistan, without any military target, were at least illegal, and possibly war crimes.",1,2024-12-08T21:23:25Z,2024-12-08T21:23:25Z

Assad atleast tried to impose a secular state with respect for differences, and since a majority muslim country are incapable of a secular democracy, a secular dictatorship is the next best thing. the worst thing is what they'll get now. a taliban like terror state that probably will pick wars with Israel and cry genocide too.

The fall of Syria is a win for the current governments of the USA UK and of course Israel. And a prize for Turkey is they get to have the whole of Cyprus which they have always wanted.
