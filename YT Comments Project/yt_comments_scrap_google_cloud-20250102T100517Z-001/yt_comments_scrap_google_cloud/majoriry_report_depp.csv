@tellthetruthna8523,The right was always behind the pro-Depp mania.   It wasn't a side effect.  It was a well organized propaganda campaign that is having real world consequences.   People on the left got duped into supporting it.   Most are doubling down instead of learning from their mistakes.,0,2022-09-17T06:52:57Z,2022-09-17T06:52:57Z
@marz9676,"Theres so many crazy aspects to this that I cant stop fixating on it, especially the mainstream incel rage and misogyny that makes me feel unsafe. Its an unhinged mob mentality wanting to crush a woman under its collective thumb for any exaggerated reason while coddling and excusing the man despite tremendous evidence of abuse.. But also, did you know Depp's true lawyer, Adam Waldman, was banned from court because of his unethical practices? He was found to feed stories and confidential info to the press, create negative social media campaigns, and was harrassing Amber for years,  it was worth it because it worked. People tuned in already hating her and wanted to see the witch burn. So did Depp, apparently, based on his texts. The bias was astounding.  What really freaked me out was that the general  public deemed Depp's texts that he said he wanted to drown, burn, and sexually assault Heard's corpse and ones like ""I'll smack the ugly c*** around .."" as NOT ABUSIVE because ""she deserved them"" and ""she drove him to it"". While Amber was deemed an abusive monster for laughing at his claims, calling him a baby, and saying that hes old. Women need to assemble.",1,2022-06-12T06:33:48Z,2022-06-12T06:33:48Z

@stevedv629,"Johnny depp case was about truth and balance,  things were out of balance,  it was a demonstration of balance.  I find the left far less dangerous if it’s wrong than the right,  but the left should accept that they can go too far.  Clearly there are tons of personality types that will take advantage of that imbalance, ie juicy smollier and now amber heard.  It’s unbalanced to hear this listener say his opinion,  but not balance it out with the tragedy of being falsely accused.  That is no small crime either.

@metaleggman18,"Yes, I think that's the unfortunate nature of this issue. She's clearly, however you want to call it, not the typical victim of abuse or a toxic relationship or whatever. But in a way, while this has been clearly latched on hard by right wingers and misogynists, I wonder if this is part of an issue with journalism in the wake of movements like metoo (and gamer gate since Dave mentioned it). Had they heard what was said about her, even just shitting in the bed, would they have published her editorial? She claims she was some public figure about abusive relationships, but much like caitlyn Jenner inserting herself into prominence during her ""grand"" coming out, perhaps this was all more cynical than we want to believe. Don't get me wrong, Depp sounds horrible, but they both do. Both spoiled brats in Hollywood, who are so far up their own ass they can't function as normal human beings. And in a way, I'm not even saying that tk shame them; I think fame and/or wealth can create monsters. When Jenner came out, it was, as a trans person, clearly cynical, and meant to somehow establish herself professionally in some way. My cis friends didn't believe me, but I feel as though this came to be true. And in the same way with heard, it seems like someone who may have been abused and formed incredibly toxic responses to the abuse, or at least was in some mutually toxic relationship, and she really should not have been given a platform. I obviously don't know heard personally, but one of the issues with the metoo movement in terms of Hollywood is that you're talking about incredibly powerful people. Maybe with more powerful people who have abused them, but still people that aren't representative of the majority of abusive relationships and domestic violence in general. So there's a bit of a danger of having given someone like heard such a voice. It's the same issue of having these wealthy, powerful people as role models, given they simply don't live like the rest of us. Again, I can't qualify in any way she wasn't abused, but I wonder if, for the movement at large, handing her the microphone was really beneficial to the movement, or that it was something she was hoping to be beneficial to her. There are many people taken advantage of in Hollywood, but as people critical of capitalism, I think we have to be smarter about who is given a voice in these matters, especially when we're talking about people in the 1%. On one hand, because of fame worship, because listen to the 1%, they can feel seen and realize they're not alone. But we can also empower people who may have bad intent.",0,2022-06-06T14:16:48Z,2022-06-06T14:16:48Z

@rl318,"People are conflating issues here. Nobody says people should not report abuse out of fear of being sued for defamation. This was a case of someone putting something out in the media implying crimes were committed, which is not how the legal process is supposed to work. If someone commits a crime, as crappy as the legal system is, that is where it should be dealt with. I am less comfortable with the idea that people can just say anything about someone that paints them as a criminal without any actual investigation or due process than how slippery the legal system can sometimes be.

@Loki_Yogi,"I watched the entire trial. I watched many different clips of the trial, as well, from at least a dozen or more channels.
On every one of those videos, I'd look through the comments to get a feel for what the public sentiment was. 
Of the thousands of comments I read, I NEVER ONCE read a single comment of someone claiming that ""we should no longer""- ""Believe all Women"". It was only about Amber's lies and how a win for JD could bring MEN into the Me Too movement, as it should've always been.  
I ALSO NEVER saw anyone talking about politics or attempting to make correlations between the right and JD.
I know that Fox News and others have come down on the side of JD very passionately, but I think it's a stretch to say this trial has become political in the usual divisive way.
I'm a former conservative that has become a passionate progressive and regular viewer of TMR and many other progressive shows on YT.

@Sombriage,"The ""me too"" movement had some parts that were good but also some that were bad. A lot of women took advantage of the movement to make false accusations which ruined a lot men's lives. Jobs lost, reputations damage, lives lost in some cases due to suicide.

What bias did the left have when it came to the ""me too"" movement? How many sides were shown when it came to said movement?

@stevenm732,The verdict was the correct one. We can say there are women who will take advantage of Me too sentiments just like we can say there are men who will take advantage of their influence and position. The truth is men and women can be abusers and each situation has to be evaluated critically. We don’t need to act like the women or the man is always right to try and protect the left or right. Me Too did a lot to give women more power in these situations and imo that was needed. But with more power there are always those who will attempt to abuse their power.,2,2022-06-05T17:51:30Z,2022-06-05T17:51:30Z
@101nemesis,"Here's how the right took control of this verdict. The ones supporting Heard, who also support the  MeToo movement, should've used this moment to accept Depp's claim that he was assaulted and subsequently announced how this is a massive win for the movement itself. This was THE perfect opportunity to quell all and any doubts that the MeToo movement doesn't care about men.

But that isn't what happened here after the verdict. Instead what happened is a lot of people fed right into the conservative narratives by not even acknowledging that Heard assaulted him or by brushing it off as her reaction to his assault despite all the evidence against that. 

Like the left has no one to blame but themselves. 
Just go read any article or opinion piece supporting Heard right now after the verdict. All are phrased in a way to make it seem like she was the victim and Depp the abuser. All use the guise that this is terrible for women victims going forward to defend Heard's actions.
We can keep pointing fingers at the conservatives about how they are treating this verdict all we want but we handed this to them on a silver platter.",40,2022-06-05T17:40:16Z,2022-06-05T22:28:06Z

They tied their flag to the MeToo mast from the get go which was fine, but then marched like lemmings behind the ""believe all women"" sentiment which was astoundingly stupid.  

Amber Heard is an ABUSER pure and simple and in front of TV cameras actually tried to gaslight the Jury and everyone else watching.  To anyone without any skin in the game, this was blatantly obvious.  

The leftist media both mainstream and online have boxed themselves into a corner and still continue to lump Amber Heard, an obvious lying, narcisstic, opportunistic and violent individual, with genuine victims of abuse simply to salvage political points.

And the misinformation and devotion to a dogmatic ""believe women above all evidence"" in this specific case is making them look like total clowns and giving even more ammo to the right.

I didn't wanna watch at first, but ended up doing so BECAUSE of the memeification of the whole thing, and the gross tone of the right on it, so I thought at least I'd be prepared, armed with facts.

Frankly the right would have been given more ammo had Depp lost because now they could frame the issue as left wing corruption affecting the justice system and drag it out for even longer, just like when Jussie Smollett was first let off the hook three years ago.

It’s ok to take the same side on an issue as a conservative on issues if they get something right every once in a while. All the left need do is embrace Depp and do it from the position that men are victims of abuse too. 

Personally, I know of quite a few men who have suffered from physical abuse by their girlfriends and wives. The correct response isn’t to shit on Amber, or harass her, but embrace Depp as someone brave enough to come out as a DA Vic in a culture that sees this as a weakness. Normalize coming forward. 

It’s also a toxic culture on the left that assumes all men are pieces of shit. That’s kind of how I feel in progressive circles. I’ve always had to couch my manhood as “I’m not one of those men, I’m one of the good ones”…it’s a bit dehumanizing. It’s almost as if it’s implied that Im guilty until proven innocent.

@ed1rko17,"This trial result was healthy. The Me Too movement needed a bit of a push back because it became a scenario where a woman could make false accusations for their own personal gain, and the person they are accusing would be seen as guilty in the public eye as soon as the accusation was made with absolutely zero questioning into the validity of their claims. This trial was proof that women, especially women who are abusers, can take advantage of this cultural movement to further continue to be abusive in even more destructive ways. It's naive to think that some men fear losing the power that they inherit from the patriarchy, but that some women don't also fear losing something like the Me Too movement which can give them gender dominance.

@tvariuness,"depp clearly proved that heard has a history of lying (caught lying about his past relationships, caught lying about donations she made, caught lying about events where she claims depp was violent towards her, caught lying about video releases to tmz) and is an abuser (literally caught on tape admitting to hitting him (did we talk about how she was arrested for dv in 2009 in another relationship)) thus proving that she is someone who can't be trusted and she was (in all likelihood) the actual abuser in the relationship. i doubt very much if heard was presenting all that evidence against depp that people would fail to see what's right in front of your faces here. also where's the evidence of all these women dropping their dv cases? where? this feels very much like a ""trust me bro"" moment. she wrote an op-ed about being abused without naming depp but clearly pointing the finger at him, he lost role after role after role and was basically blacklisted for a minute all the while she was the abuser. if there are women doing this, yes they should absolutely drop their cases. 100% and we should be CELEBRATING that (if it's actually happening at all).",2,2022-06-05T02:50:49Z,2022-06-05T02:50:49Z

@bkucenski,"This trial was important for men who find themselves in a Domestic Violence situation.  Call a lawyer to help guide you out before you do things you need a lawyer to defend you in court.

Amber Heard is a classic narcissist who was caught lying when the record was examined.  Johnny Depp has dealt with the consequences of his actions.  Now Heard will deal with the consequences of hers.

Amber Heard insulted Depp for wanting to tell his friends what was happening.  That's what abusers do.  Amber Heard told Johnny Depp no one would believe him if he went to the legal system.  That's what abusers do.

Being abused by your partner is nothing to be ashamed of.  Tell your friends.  Tell a lawyer.  Make a plan and get out.  Plenty of Domestic Violence victims will eventually fight back and that's when abusers like Heard act like you're trapped.  That's the blackmail they're looking for to control you.

@shojingod,"We need a level of correction in the Me Too movement. Some of the Me Too process was for self promotion or revenge because of jealousy.  True assault on both side should be prosecuted.  If it is verbal then no it's not a Me Too thing. You are an adult woman you should be able to handle things to a certain degree.  A level of Me Too is turning woman into no more than infants in regard to personal responsibility. Regretful sex is not a Me Too thing as well. You have to hold a certain level of control as an adult. We had many stories of people being crucified for allegation being brought up. Not proven just mentioned.  It seems like the men always take the damage and when it's proven that it was a lie then the woman walks free no counter action the majority of the time. What happened to JD is rare where the person making claims has consequences. Amber Heard should be going to jail for perjury as well as anybody that lies in court but it doesn't happen when it involves false rape, abuse accusations.  They destroy the life a person and they walk away free. Now let me be clear if they come out and they  are a victim of abuse then the person should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law but it has to be a prosecution not hearsay and if they lie in court they should be prosecuted for perjury as well. Abuse has been pigeon holed into only involving woman only but many men have been abused by the wife or girl friend and when they go the law they are the ones charged.

Why? In what way is this a loss for the ""me-too"" movement? Didn't that movement from the start include male victims of abuse as well? Or have you literally become the caricature the right-wing thinks you are and your politics boil down to ""women good, men bad""? 

Why not attack the right for their ridiculous framing of this and correct it with an anti-abuse framing of yourself? Because this could be seen as a win against abuse, you know.",76,2022-06-04T21:55:17Z,2022-06-04T21:55:17Z

@DanielCarrapa,"Love your show and I've got nothing against Me Too, but if a movement is so fragile that you have to support an abuser, than maybe you have to rethink your movement. If you followed this case, it's not that complicated. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard had a very toxic relationship. Alcohol and drugs sure didn't help. But Amber Heard lied about instances of physical violence and sexual abuse, repeatedly. There is also undisputable evidence that Amber Heard herself abused Johnny Depp physically, multiple times. She tried to pose as a victim of domestic violence, faked injuries - JD had not been with AH for five days when she submitted her RO, yet she presents herself to the media on that day with a bruise on her face, that magically was gone the next day, and let's not even talk about the James Corden episode - and the jury saw right through her. It is what it is. It's not a political issue. Left wing 'Me Too' liberals making it so is what opens an avenue for opportunist right wingers to co-opt the internet crowd.",2,2022-06-04T21:35:53Z,2022-06-04T22:12:49Z

@mockingbird4346,"Seriously, if you want to avoid the right taking advantage of Heard being found to be a liar, don't make up shit about the case or act like a liar being caught harms actual survivors.

The way to prevent that is to take better advantage of this and attack the right to show how disingenuous they are.

Personally I've been arguing that this case goes to prove that not only are false accusations rare, but if accusations are false it will be found out, so there's no reason not to support women coming out with their stories. If we capitalize off this case properly it doesn't have to be something that the right uses to gain ground.

Alternatively we could continue to pretend that a liar who made up her allegations of abuse getting caught is a bad thing which will only help the right by making the left look like fucking lunatics.",23,2022-06-04T21:21:48Z,2022-06-04T21:21:48Z

It's been surreal to watch things unfold during the trial that triggered my PTSD as a survivor, and it was stuff like manipulation and set-ups.

Your personal hot takes on the outcome of the trial are irrelevant to the ""bigger issue"" you purport exists. You guys are giving the GOP wind in their sails on this one. Let them show their true colors, like they always do. However, attaching the MeToo movement to this verdict in some sideways manner like you guys are reaching to do does absolutely nothing but validate their insane assertions and ploys for attention. Any sane person understands that it will take much more than a singular anomaly like this case to dissuade a movement as monumental and powerful as MeToo. You guys are crying wolf when we should just be laughing these right-wing idiots back into their cousins' holes.
