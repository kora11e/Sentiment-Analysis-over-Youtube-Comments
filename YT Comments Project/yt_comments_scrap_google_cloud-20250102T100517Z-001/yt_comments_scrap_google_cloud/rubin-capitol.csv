@Ristofec,I‚Äôve never seen one person know so little about politics yet have millions of dollars behind them (koch),1,2021-07-07T23:57:36Z,2021-07-07T23:57:36Z
@ConsciousExpression,"Dave maybe the reason the only thing people want to talk with you about IRL and online is politics because you've waded deep into the loony bin and greeted all the George Washingtons in the asylum as Mr. President. And online you tend to see the crap you click on the most. You've also become the iconic poster boy example of a left wing grifter. People like me tried to warn everyone, including you, that Trump would never accept the results of the election and that he would do anything to stay in power. You called us deranged. Now that our predictions have come true, we're told we're deranged for NOTICING they came true.

Even now Trump is claiming he'll be reinstated in August. And the only way that could happen is a military coup. There's literally no constitutional remedy once a president is sworn in, other than impeachment, in which case Kamala Harris would become president, not Trump. So Trump is literally toying with the idea of a military overthrow of our government. And he was enabled in large part by you and other people like you.

I used to like you and thought that you were a man of integrity, because you noticed the same problems on the left that I noticed, and you stood up to the moronic bullies like Cenk Uygur. Good lord how wrong I was. I want to thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. I'll never trust a media personality again.",0,2021-06-17T19:22:54Z,2021-06-17T19:22:54Z

@Holdit66,"""How do we have faith in our elections again"" ""People have valid concerns"". Very disappointing stuff from Rubin, who gives every appearance of trying to have his bread buttered on both sides, presumably to avoid upsetting those of his subscribers who are  easily-triggered Trumpistas. You can have faith in your elections by virtue of the fact that the the courts, in 60+ cases , found that there were no grounds to proceed. Even the supreme court with its new batch of Trump-appointees, threw it out.  That's how can have faith in your elections, unless of course you just don't want to because the most recent election gave you the wrong result.  The rest is just classic appeal-to-incredulity fallacy. ""The result surprised me, so it looks fishy"", in other words. Sure, Biden didn't campaign as hard as Trump (for sound health reasons, but hey, why mention that eh, it might make your fave super-spreader candidate look bad) , but if we're bringing that kind of context into it let's not forget to that people had had four years of the breath of fresh air that Trump was supposed to be, and many considered him a busted flush if not a downright embarrassment, and you were also careful not to mention the complete clusterf*ck he'd made of managing the COVID-19 response. Those are perfectly adequate reasons to explain a swing to Biden, but hey, gotta keep the tinfoil-hat brigade on board... I've enjoyed many of your broadcasts and was indeed taken in by the ""thoughtful right-winger"" act, and still agree with you about things like no-platforming and SJW propaganda. but you sure let the mask slip with this video.",2,2021-01-16T15:21:22Z,2021-01-16T15:21:22Z

@dgh5760,"Extremist groups will always infiltrate legitimate protests to hide their actions and put blame on the protest rather than the individuals who engage in criminal activities whether at political rallies, BLM, etc.  That is the risk you have with taking protests to the street.  I wouldn't be so quick to decide what Biden is going to do. He is a moderate not an extremist.  Let's see what he does first and then we can criticize where necessary.  The pendulum swings from right to left to right and back.   Individuals along the political continuum are necessary for checks and balances to keep us away from the extreme ends of the spectrum.  Working together rather than fighting each other is the only way to keep a country on an even keel.  The election was a fair election despite claims to the contrary and with the country almost equally divided you will get close elections in both directions.  Quit with the election conspiracy theories already.  States have the right to run their elections as they see fit.  If you don't like it then use the system to make changes to law instead of complaining about it or taking unproductive actions.

@fongdimbulator,"While your ""I'm not saying This or That - I'm just asking questions"" schtick sounds innocent enough, I'm genuinely perplexed how it is that people are still convinced that mass voter fraud (perpetuated only this year, and only by the democrats) has taken place? 
So many eye witness accounts where people noticed ""something a bit weird"" which ended up having perfectly reasonable explanations. Dozens and dozens of cases thrown out of the American courts all the way up to the Supreme Court level. The only people peddling this nonsense are Trump himself and OANN - a news source so ridiculously bias that it makes Fox look positively centrist.  (As a proud opponent of the media - even you must roll your eyes at Trump's repeated endorsements of this absurd political news source).
Who orchestrated this mass fraud operation? How many hundreds - if not thousands - of people are complicit in this conspiracy? How much prison time do they potentially face by agreeing to take part in such a deeply unpatriotic and highly illegal operation? How did they manage to loop in all of these public servants into the scheme to count votes, deliver ballots, poll watch, security, etc without any of them spilling the details of their nefarious scheme?

@winter32842,Pathetic that Rubin is doublespeaking about the election fraud. I saw the hearing about elections fraud and issues Republicans found. None of them were smoking gun. They thought something was weird from their perspective. There could be logical reasons to them and we have to look at full context like taking both side's point of view. That's why we have the court. Trump lost all court cases most of them with Republican or Trump appointed judge. Georgia did full audit and they found no fraud. Georgia responded to all conspiracy point by point. Voting machine company is suing conspiracy theorist. Good for them. Also the reason why Biden won more votes is because America's demographic is slowly changing: more immigrants and minorities voters make up each passing years and they mainly vote Democrats.,0,2021-01-11T01:37:32Z,2021-01-11T01:57:58Z

Antifa share the same ideology as the the trump supporters and were there too. Up till now most of the intruders that were arrested are trump supports. Why the president didn't call for army to help with the situation like he did when the BLM were protesting.

@DrMarilynJoyce,"30 buses of antifa rioters were escorted to the Capitol by state trooper vehicles...I have the videos of this. This was all planned to set up and make the Trump supporters look bad. There are also plenty of videos demonstrating that the police opened the way, moved the bicycle stands or whatever they were using to block the area,  and waved the Trump supporters into the building. I also have that footage. And let's not forget the huge number of purchased Trump gear by antifa members in prep for the 6th! The whole damn thing was a complete set-up! 

And this is just one of the many messages I have received from reporter friends: 
From Richard T. Riley:
""So I find it comical how sooo many people on FB are commenting about what they THINK happened or the narrative they are seeing on the news regarding the March at the Capital. Well SINCE I AM HERE IN PERSON reporting and saw everything, I will tell you NOTHING aligns with what the media was and is saying - I will also tell you that close to 1.5 million people PEACEABLY Protested the entire time - Antifa showed up on the 5th and 6th Dressed in Capital Police Uniforms and Trump Apparel and started attacking Trump supporters. After President Trump spoke at Elipse Park scores of people marched to the Capitol in protest of what is thought to be wide-spread fraud and THAT IS THEIR RIGHT!! 6 people broke into the capital and all 6 were identified as Antifa members and arrested. So please get your story straight before you villainize a lot of people.""

It is ludicrous for people to create such an uproar over this without the real facts. But then with all Social Media and MSM blocking real news we are only getting the crap that they vomit all over us! As JFK so aptly stated decades ago: ‚ÄúThose who make peaceful revolution and change impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.‚Äù Wake the ""h"" up! 

It ain't over till it's over! We will see what unfolds in the next few days, weeks, months and years!",0,2021-01-09T09:30:53Z,2021-01-09T09:31:49Z

@FifthConcerto,"I am currently reading Brandon Sanderson's ""Way of Kings"".  A phrase that comes up repeatedly from one of the main characters talks about turning a liability into a strength when you can.  I think that is an idea that applies well to our current world.  Power seekers have done this in a negative way with everything from 9/11 to the Great Recession, and COVID just looking at recent history.  We need to do that in a positive way.  OK, these things happened, and they were horrible.  So, now we have options, and some of those options are to use the bad to do good.  We don't have to flip off Leftists and tell them how hypocritical they are for denouncing the bad actors among Trump Supporters.  Instead, we can say, ""You're right, that was bad.  Why is this what we're seeing now on the right, while on the left we're seeing looting and property damage and the rest in response to other things?  Doesn't it seem significant that extreme actors who call each other enemies sound exactly the same when described out of context?  What do these people have in common, and how do we fix THAT problem?""

I'm going to keep saying this in the hopes that I start to see others say it too.  The new revolution is to be moral and do good without permission.  And we need to talk about how and why we should and are doing those things.  And we need to look at the common cause between the bad that Antifa does and the bad that the Right wing mob just did.

@Greg-xs5py,"Overthrow of a corrupt government is basically what the Declaration of Independence is all about:

""That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long established, should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security"".

There are uncanny similarities with what happened when the post-communist left was challenged in Romania in February 1990 (when a protest against the political police was the scene of the storming of the Government building, which was the excuse for the second mineriad), August 1991 (when the same miners that had used violence in the support of the post-communists in three mineriads in 1990 where brought in to bring down the Cabinet turned anti-communist after the Moscow coup, got applauded by the convention of the main right wing party and then stormed the lower house while in session, where they were urged out and shamed out of violent gestures by the parliamentary leader of the opposition group, protected only by his courage, ellooquence and his bare hands), or 2018, when protesters where unsuccessfully incited to storm the Cabinet building.

@BHaidacher,"I am German Latin American lived mainly in Latin America. In my humble opinion you are looking at the obvious but not at the root of the problem. 

There is a scene in a very old Zorro Disney movie. The governor knew there was going to be unrest and a pacific demonstration. He paid one guy to throw a stone at him to enable him to use force against the demonstrators.

With the riots the fraud news became old news. All the left and the media focused on this and started attacking Trump.

I don't like Trump's style. I can understand his human behavior. He mad the mistake of turning everyone around him into a foe out of frustration. He has endured quite a lot and is used to be a one man show getting things done. 

The one foe he turned against him is the department of state that has no constituency and has perpetuated itself as the real power in the USA (World). By threatening to drain the swamp, all the creatures where aligned to one objective.

I have seen this many times in Latin America. The fraud, the political acceptance due to ""lack of evidence"" or courts case ""dismissals"". The USA has become a Banana Republic where the rule of law is applied depending on convenience. Where the ones who lie get ahead and no one dares to do anything. Where values and principles are for the stupid. The way to getting ahead is cheating.

I do not presume to know who was doing the breaking and entering and destruction of property. Many protests during the summer also had far left and right doing the rioting and damage. Usually it is that rather than one party or the other. Saying extremists works, because in all honesty at least until we have more information we do not really know. I would like your opinion on the rally, what Trump said .He did say he was going with them and then did not.  I also have heard that Trump had tried to call ahead to slow down the counting. And this is a guess, some say the police let the people in and perhaps it was suppose to be just people going in and saying hey this is what we want. We want things checked better. Which would have been better than what happened. By law right now though states have the ability to run their elections, not the Federal government so changing some of this may take away the personal rights and freedom of a secret ballot. I do like that I can go online and make sure my ballot was received and entered. The two parties put different type of freedoms in a different order, so the list of priorities are all a bit different. Just like some people don't want to help the poor and others think the wealthy get too many breaks. The parties should stop working against each other and speak with respect and listen to each other. I rather agree Cooper is a bit opinionated but maybe he is not news and is opinion? You saying how wealthy he is, well I agree he is, but you are also. I do agree we should be able to get news like we get the weather, which could be wrong. In any case an opinion is rather insignificant. Them saying it will be hot or cold etc. doesn't insult anyone too much. Again thank you for the information. Like I said I am not in either party so no one is very happy with my view. I will check out the link with Tulsi Gabbard. Like you I did not really love who the Dems put in, but I didn't really like who the Rep. did either. And yes to we are all Americans, some of our opinions have to do with what part of the country or state we live in. Each can be like a different country if you move there. Try to give others with differing opinions a chance. As an Independent I listen to all, and weigh it to pick how I want to vote. I also try to vote in a way that I think is the best fit for all.",0,2021-01-08T11:58:36Z,2021-01-08T11:58:36Z

@altestevondrei,"I think that we as a country have given over WAY too much power to the federal government. Constitutionally the majority of the governing power was intended to lie with individual states. To that end we can clearly see those states that protect their citizens and govern independently vs. those that rely largely on federal money.

I think we have failed to make a dent on the federal level to pull back on radical Marxist tyranny BECAUSE we lack support on the state level. 

Learning from all thats happened in 2020 I think we have to take the fight for freedom back to our local and state governing bodies first.

We as a culture will have to find a way back to American grit and self reliance and move away from government money and programs in our daily lives if we're ever going to be free again.

Even chains made of gold are STILL CHAINS. We are beholden to those that we rely upon to live, financially or otherwise.

I personally plan to become more active with my local, county and state activities to be a voice for independent education, reason, fiscal responsibility, and individual  freedoms.

@tokyobrit7220,"A team of the some of the highest paid lawyers and legal experts in the country have spent over two months desperately looking for evidence of election fraud that would stand up in court. These experts, working for Trump, have been highly motivated to find something - anything - to prove election fraud. They came up with nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. (Sound of crickets chirping.)
Think about that.
Trump‚Äôs lawyers and legal experts found no credible evidence. Trump ally Bill Barr found no evidence. Independent international observers found no evidence. The states found no evidence. Judges, including Republicans and Trump appointed judges, laughed the Trump team‚Äôs legal efforts out of court.
Could this possibly be because there is no evidence, because there was no widespread election fraud?
Or should we think election fraud is real just because some folks on the internet, along with Trump and his enablers say so? (Providing either no evidence or regurgitating already debunked ‚Äòevidence.)

Sorry, but for the rest of us, living outside the bubble of pro-Trump propaganda and misinformation, the fact that a lot of people believe election fraud happened doesn‚Äôt mean a thing. We have no reason to take any of this seriously. And we have very good reason to be angry and frustrated about people continuing to spread lies and rumors that undermine democracy without a shred of credible evidence.

And were there ANTIFA at the Capitol? I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not impossible. 

But so far I‚Äôve seen plenty of folks identified as Trump supporters, and even folks who happily identified themselves as Trump supporters. I haven‚Äôt seen any individuals identified as ANTFA members. If they were there, it should be pretty easy to prove, and I‚Äôm sure the FBI would be very interested. Half the people there seemed to have their smartphones out recording their lawbreaking, so there‚Äôs a high chance that any ANTIFA members, if they were there, were caught on camera and could easily be identified. So far none have. Until and unless they are, it‚Äôs just a claim we shouldn‚Äôt take too seriously.

I have to agree about the danger of media and especially social media though. But perhaps the biggest danger is that we‚Äôre all trapped in our own bubbles with people who share our opinions and think like us, and never take a chance to listen to the other side, afraid of anything that might challenge our narrow little worldviews. If there‚Äôs ever going to be any healing, we really need to get out of our bubbles and listen to what others have to say.

Ted Cruz made a totally reasonable offer ... but the very FIRST debate was interrupted ... perfectly reasonable, when there IS a real, though maybe very small risk it might have changed the day's outcome.

This (Clinton-friend) Good Morning America Anchor never used such terms when a mob occupied streets in the Pacific NW (CHAZ) or when government buildings and businesses were set a blaze. They were just protestors. 

Also, this HAS happened in history George!

- The Bonus Army March -

These 'poor and ignorant' men stormed D.C. due to not getting their promised bonus checks from their service in WW1. It was the height of the Great Depression and they deserved every penny they had been promised.

The 'deplorable' Trump supporters are upset about the $600 stimulus checks, when first promised a $2,000 check.

The political theme surrounding the chaos that ensued with the Bonus Army March mirrors the Trump supporters' ascension upon D.C. When the disgruntled populous are blue collar, average Joe the Plumber citizens, the insults and labeling by the media goes rampant.

Antifa was blamed for inciting violence yesterday, and the American Communist Party was blamed for inciting violence during the Bonus Army March.

I don't know how it happens, maybe through media manipulation and/or people's forgetfulnesd, but suome undeserving individual will come out of yesterday's stuff smelling like a rose, as the saying goes. 

What I'm getting at is...

Major Dwight D Eisenhower was hands on in the militarized response in the D.C. streets against fellow veterans of the Bonus Army Marchers.

Yet, a short time later he rises up to rank of General and then U.S. President.

These people were incited by Trump and his enablers with false conspiracy theories of voter fraud.  Every single court in the land has thrown out every lawsuit.  Not one elected Republican official who was in charge of overseeing the election has said there was fraud.  The latest Republican to come out and say there was no election fraud was Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.  Zero evidence.  Anywhere.
  The way you downplayed the fact that domestic terrorists took over the Capital Building and sat at the desk of the Speaker of the House is nothing short of terrifying.

Most American are all about politic identity. You're nothing but just a pawn in a chess game. Politicians sitting in their couch in a nice home spending your tax money and never get shit done. All of these years people still believe in politicians.  What is the definition of politic?  1: POLITICAL
2: characterized by shrewdness in managing, contriving, or dealing
3: sagacious in promoting a policy
4: shrewdly tactful

These definitions never mentioning  ""resolving a problem"". IT's all about managing a problem. There are institutions that should not be part of politic period. Police, military, fire department, health department, judge department, and the media(suppose to). The media have failed their purpose. I wonder which department going to be next? Police, military, health, fire department, or the judge department? Human being don't deservers goodness in life cause they take advantage of it. People doing what they're not suppose to do. One way to guarantee that human being staying in line is to have some other being put us in check. Somebody said something like this. If your not watching the news, you're not informed. If you watching the news you're misinformed.",0,2021-01-08T05:44:07Z,2021-01-08T05:44:07Z

@KSRobinette,One of the most important parts of any attempt to save America is for all freedom lovers to get involved in local politics.  Local politicians and their appointees manage elections and write election rules.  Local D.A.'s decide whether or not to prosecute vote counting managers who count fraudulent ballots.  Local election boards hire the poll workers and choose whether to try to get honest workers or political hacks.  Local mayors and city council members influence everything that happens in our daily lives.  Local judges decide on the legality of election rule changes made by unelected officials.  State legislators and judges and governors and secretaries of state write and manage statewide elections.  We have no chance of fixing things at the federal level until we can force all of our states to hold transparently honest elections.  Only then can we vote the criminals out in favor of the less criminal.,0,2021-01-08T04:26:18Z,2021-01-08T04:26:18Z

He did not say that the tree of liberty must be fed by chanting peacefully, did he?  I am fairly sure that no regime, or change of regime, has ever succeeded without a violent beginning.  Trump promised to drain the swamp, i.e. disrupt the status quo, which is essentially a form of regime change.

The Democrats ride the COVID and  BLM/Defund train all the way up to the election. Blame the disease and the violence and the racism on ""the Other Side"". 
Once you're in power though, you need a way to back pedal on the police stuff, since control requires both fear and strong law enforcement.

The DC police refuse Federal help and seemingly allow these yahoos to break into the heart of congress without much opposition... ANTIFA couldn't take a courthouse after weeks but congress is like, a 15 minute job? Okay. 
The media spins it as a coup and terrorism.

Cue the excuse for all the Republicans to jump ship, the ""line that could not be crossed"" so they can pretend they're bailing for reasons of principle.

Democrats win, saying more censorship and police and enforcement are needed to prevent this happening again. The idiot masses believe the Government is protecting them, and cheers it all on.

@theducklinghomesteadandgar6639,"I appreciate Dave and others showing all sides as much as possible in these circumstances so people can make an informed decision. ALL people should appreciate this. NO ONE not any government official, not anyone in the media not even most family and friends and sometimes even oneself, can or should be trusted to give an absolute truth from all sides for more than 1 reason!!!! 
1) If more than one person is involved in any given situation one CANNOT get the entire truth from just one person, especially as that person doesn't know the other's thoughts, why they acted a certain way or is even capable of seeing the entire picture of actions, or hearing everything in any given situation, even IF both parties tell what they saw and heard with absolute truth as they know and saw it. 
2) Obviously not everyone is honest or can be trusted to take other's well being into perspective.
3) Any given person could be compromised in their actions and words due to outside threats against them or loved ones, or be bribed/bought off, plain ole corruption
4) The actions of a few in a group can lead the entire group down an unwanted path in a heartbeat, due to specific circumstances that may not be avoidable for some innocent people drug into the situation by the mob/group
5) In EVERY given things could have happened or been said that were missed by at least one person involved, if not all, that IF known may change what they thought they knew, and or may have played a role in what actually happened
6) In a case involving more than one person could always have the potential of someone acting with specific detrimental intent towards that person, other people and/or groups, etc.",0,2021-01-08T01:48:27Z,2021-01-08T01:50:36Z

@davidgrantham2800,"I am appalled that the situation degraded to the point, where people who have been known for being supportive of law enforcement supportive of our government officials Etc felt the need to do the things that happened yesterday. Right now everyone keeps acting like everybody that supported President Trump is now committed treason, which they did not do, making all these threats towards people who were there, trying to communicate to their government what is that they're feeling and what's going on in our world that these elitist government officials are not seeing or are ignoring. You have people blatantly, explicitly, and without any appearance of Illusion that they're not doing it stating they intend to violate the basic grounds of our constitutional republic. In our constitution at Pacific Lee describes how we change the Bill of Rights Etc. When it comes to changing the rights guaranteed by the Constitution it takes 3/4 of the state legislators voting yes to it. Every Democrat in Congress also have to have a 75% approval there for it to have it happen they can't get those kind of numbers because approximately from looking at the numbers from the last election we still have as far as voters are concerned in this country over 40% of people who are voting more conservative who would not want their gun rights removed for an example, the First Amendment rights lost as another example. When you threaten people to the point that they're going to lose their livelihood they're losing their ability to practice their religion freedom of speech freedom to move around freedom to meet and talk with other human beings, the right to play lose the right to self-defense, which according to hell or is what the 2nd Amendment is. You're destroying what we were founded for. As long as we keep having people attacking the foundations of the Republic the Bill of Rights are under attack. They're talking about this great reset going on loss of your property without any nothing you would know the great recent requires us to not have any more personal property. You would lose everything. That is what they're telling the American people that are hearing it that are really seen what they're saying are freaking out. They feel like they're backed into a corner. If I'm not mistaken even in the Art of War it says never leave an opponent without a way to get out. Right now people that acted the way they did yesterday did it out of desperation because their backs were against the wall. The might of the United States is telling them they no longer have their rights and privileges guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States because someone's going to pass along the over rights the Constitution what you supposed to not be able to happen. The court that are supposed to say Yes is constitutional or no it's not constitutional or keeping their mouth shut. The courts have become litigators by the man rather than being judicator. Their supposed to do, either it's in the law or it's not, not making up new laws off their decisions. Good example is the Constitution specifically said anything that is not already assigned to the federal government for control belongs to the states. They also state and Decisions by the Supreme Court that no state shall deny you something another state allows you Roe versus Wade, yet the Second Amendment is being stomped all over the hell over in New York California and other states when you have other states such as whining what anyone can buy a gun and carry it down the streets. Yet the competition also guarantees us equal treatment under law how is Italy equal forgotten Wyoming to carry a gun on the street and in California you're denied even access to one unless you basically have to kiss someone ass in bed for the right to have a gun.

@emerald637,"Two known Antifa members posed as pro-Trump to infiltrate Capitol riot: sources
By Larry Celona
January 7, 2021 | 12:40am | 

At least two known Antifa members were spotted among the throngs of pro-Trump protesters at the Capitol on Wednesday, a law enforcement source told The Post.
The Antifa members disguised themselves with pro-Trump clothing to join in the DC rioting said the sources, who spotted the infiltrators while monitoring video coverage from the Capitol.

The infiltrators were recognized due to their participation in New York City demonstrations, and were believed to have joined in the rioting so that Trump would get blamed, the source said.

A Washington Times report initially claimed two other protesters were actually Philadelphia-based Antifa members ‚Äî citing a retired military officer with access to facial recognition software ‚Äî but the outlet deleted the article after the software company told Buzzfeed News that the story was ‚Äúoutright false.‚Äù",1,2021-01-08T00:14:03Z,2021-01-08T00:14:03Z

@CallsItLikeISeizeIts,"Have you not seen 60's/70's War/Rights Riots? Occupying Govt Bldgs. was normal. Bldg. wasn't burned, wasn't destroyed , small damage. No Storming, allowed to walk right in, was a Protest, only small instances of confrontation, NO riot. Look at ALL the video and you will see majority standing around doing nothing and only small numbers of Agitators causing trouble, SMALL numbers, a handful.. That's called a Protest, NOT a Riot. Only 52 Arrests for hundreds of thousands. 99% stayed outside, you will see cops meandering thru crowd's unmolested, taking selfies, I talked to many cops., their demeanor was chill. 

When you watch videos, how many seas of moving rioting folks do you see? Hardly any, look in background, most are standing still ( NOT rioting) and close ones are filming. Hundreds of Thousands and only 52 arrests. That bears with what I experienced. Lots of shoving, but only the agitators were really arrested on the spot. That's who cops focused on I (easy to spot them right off) Everyone was polite, saying excuse me , sorry etc in the crowd. As your 1st video showed, that was 99.9% of crowd. Media spinning this waaay out of control. 

THATS why USCP not ready for a riot cause there wasn't one, it was a peaceful protest, only AFTER agitators got in  and started trouble did they lock down inside, which triggered certain actions. And what happened? NO Members hurt or even accosted, never came face to face with demonstrators! USCP job, just like the USSS , is to protect life, NOT property. Hoe any times have you seen that at WH, they could care less if POTUS Not in, hell guy unloaded with AK and Bush was on other side of WH and they didn't over react cause protectee was NOT in danger. 

No Member was in actual danger and USCP went to lockdown and protected life, not property. Anyone who threatened a member would be gunned down in hail of bullets, especially after ball game shooting. Yall need to think about it now......Not A Riot, and pales in comparison to BLM burning blocks for years. Now they will hang Scapegoats for a Non riot, sorta like the C19 sham! Again, USCP not prepared for a riot cause there wasn't one and one did not occur. All smoke blame game.

USC is covered by Facial Recognition. There will be joes just wandering around ignorant but trespassing, and the hard core agitators damaging USG Property who will get nailed.

For what knowledgeable people said was a man that had ""good instincts"" was well on his way to right the ship that was listing to the left and was becoming a doormat to the global economy. So what happened? My personal opinion is that Trump was his worst enemy. He rode into the White House goading the media's egos and getting all kinds of free press. Exploiting Hillary Clinton's weaknesses and making the 2016 election into a ""anyone but Clinton"" race paved the way for Trump into the Oval Office. But then the cobra Trump could not settle in and his thin skin set him on the attack to anyone who dared to criticize him. The name calling seemed funny for a while. But after three in a half years, it grew to petty, small, and frankly, immature. Trump may have ruled his empire in that fashion but he could not acknowledge that America is bigger than him and does not revolve him. And it turn the 2020 election into a ""anyone but Trump"" event. I watched Obama run this country into the ground both economically and globally but he continued to be well liked.

@poedickens,"My FB post from earlier today:

Civil unrest, lawlessness, violence and destruction is NEVER acceptable as a means of ""making your voice heard,"" here in America. As a United States veteran, retired law enforcement officer, and an American, I am stunned and shocked about the events in Washington, D.C. Of course I'm only referring to the violence, destruction, and unlawful entry into our Nation‚Äôs Capital and not the peaceful protest and demonstration exhibited by decent and hardworking Americans who were in DC to express their justifiable discontent regarding the significant election fraud and misconduct, as observed in our November presidential election.

The treachery, displayed by the Democratic Party (before, during, and after ‚Äúelection day‚Äù), has been on such a scale as to make the illegal and illegitimate result, an insurrection and coup in and of itself. Once, well-intentioned elected officials and appointed magistrates, have now sold out their honor and integrity, all to remove just one single man from office; however, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù is not necessarily just ‚Äúone man.‚Äù The idea of ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù has become a representation of what was once good and true in our great nation; an idea based on a set of principles that personal responsibility, honesty, and hard work are rewarded with success and personal achievement.

It appears that the runaway train that is this new totalitarian, socialist coalition (no longer the DNC) has picked up enough momentum, and through ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù and intimidation, has coerced enough of our so called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in government to allow this insurrection to come to pass. Once it has been determined that ‚Äúelections,‚Äù as a form of peaceful revolution, is no longer a trusted and reliable means to halt an authoritarian government, we have destroyed the United States Constitution and the ‚Äúidea‚Äù that is the United States of America.

@garyk.nedrow8302,"Rubin got this story wrong -- along with the rest of the media.  The MAGA marchers were peaceful.  The group that stormed the Capitol used the same M.O. as Antifa in fomenting last summer's urban riots.  Police also found caches of Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, and riot materials.  The MAGA marchers didn't put them there.  I would not be surprised to learn that the Democrats hired agitators to disrupt the debate on the electors certification to ensure Biden's confirmation.  After all, it's the Democrats who benefited from the unrest, and Trump who was quickly blamed, with no evidence to support the charge.  The Capitol was also lightly patroled despite the huge crowd that milled about all day outside, and the guards retreated very quickly, as though permitting the mob to come inside.  Afterwards, N. Pelosi gave a very dramatic speech on the floor of the House, a speech too polished to be spontaneous.  It appears she had advance knowledge of the event.  The whole things suggests a plot to discredit Trump and impede the senators who challenged the election results.

@campbella2796,I honestly don't think people should be ashamed of what happened yesterday. It wasn't nearly as violent as much of the rioting last year although it's being hyped up by the media of course. Calling them terrorists is such a joke. If that had been a blm or antifa riot there wouldn't have been a capitol building left. And it's a very clear demonstration of people's frustration at a  rigged election followed by the unwillingness of the establishment to verify the results. All those judges simply washing their hands of it because they didn't want to be seen to rock the boat... this was the result.  In an ideal word it would be a wake call to improve the electoral processes and to treat complaints seriously.

@ST-ry7lr,"Don't be gutless - you don't need to apologize for what happened yesterday.  Trump did NOT incite violence or rioting.  The violent agitators WERE clearly antifa/BLM, and other liberal supporting people.  We have 4 years of experience with Trump supporters, who have gathered in massive numbers with no violence or rioting.  And Trump has been slamming the Dems, RINO's, and MSM for the entire 4 years.  No violence, other than Antifa attacking Trump supporters.  
And the one woman who was killed was an unarmed Trump supporter.  She was NOT killed by a Trump supporter - she was killed by a member of the capital police force.  It's virtually impossible to get this information from the MSM. ¬†

For the entire day yesterday the story was that violent Trump supporters had killed someone.  It DID NOT HAPPEN.  All the MSM have just copied CNN's report that there were 4 dead, but no evidence this is true.  At least CBS says that all of the deaths other than the one caused by the police were medical emergencies - no indication that there was any violence involved.  More MSM lies.

Trump didn't cause this.  His supporters didn't cause this.  Obama started this.  The democrat party and the MSM created this situation.  They have supported and funded antifa and BLM.",0,2021-01-07T22:18:59Z,2021-01-07T22:18:59Z

@CaptZdq1,"There is the theory by the luny left n the police that there was a conspiracy to storm the Capitol. Well, it may be true, but there certainly was a conspiracy to steal the election. That is  a conspiracy fact. The Demoncrats stole the election thru massive fraud. That was a coup d'√©tat. There were 100s or even 1000s of affadavits and eyewitness testimony, and the voting machines were proven fraudulent, n there were in some places more votes than there were people, n dead people were 'voting', there was foreign interference, etc. etc. There were even Democrat whistleblowers, n 30 % of Democrats believe there was massive election fraud.  That there was massive election fraud is indisputable n undeniable n everyone knows very well there was. The courts are corrupt, n that's why they didn't support the allegations. It was Trump who won n in a landslide, too. 

And the police murdered a 16-yr.-old girl in cold blood. Every one is being blamed for it except the murderer. She is a heroine. But no one is talking about her. Always when some one is a victim of murder by the police his or her picture and name are released. This hasn't happened with her, n I don't think it ever will, n she is forgotten already.

And Biden is an amoral hypocrite, guilty of rape, pedophilia, dishonest business dealings, n support for Chinese communism, n his running mate was been totally discredited n exposed by Tulsi Gabbard on national TV. Only extremists would vote for them. And the extreme left is abusive n scurrilous, n is a culture of denial n projection.",0,2021-01-07T22:18:30Z,2021-01-07T22:18:30Z

@mrnobody2873,"The last couple episodes were a bit contrived and felt more like fanfiction than an official release from Lucasfilm. In fact, most of the story elements look like they were taken from the last 2 decade's big SW games. The Creature interactions and the Krayt Dragon hunt, especially seem to have come from SW Galaxies(a MMORGP Set just after Empire) and the Mandalorian and Bounty Hunter lore from Knights of the Old Republic I& II (set 1000 years prior).  Really though, what they seem to be doing is restoring the main points of the Expanded Universe Canon that was cut when the last Trilogy started.

We expected to see Antifa BLM but didn‚Äôt see a single black ü•ã or covered face , only what seemed to be patriots in MAGA regalia. Aside from no Antifa or BLM we didn‚Äôt witness anything strange until we arrived at the capitol building. The first thing I witnessed were strange booms . The first two seemed to come from the direction of White House . Then we saw two people walking quickly away from crowd saying people were being shot w/rubber bullets by people on the capitol roof . This seemed a little strange but became even more strange when I heard the same thing 10 minutes later by another guy 2 blocks away. As I approached the capitol I saw individuals ushering people forward getting people riled up. When I got up to the scaffolding there was another guy encouraging people to move up the scaffolding!

@noraferguson5658,"One woman's account
The cops on the capital were shooting into the peaceful crowd with rubber bullets and paint ball guns. 

They used flash grenades. Multiple of them. I wasn‚Äôt even close to the capital. I was in the grass. A flash Grenade went off 5 yards from me. And it caused this old man to have a heart attack. I started compressions on him before these big men picked him up. And tried to carry him through the crowd. I‚Äôm sure he died. And then 3 feet from me the cops shot either a rubber bullet or paint ball at a kid younger than me. It ripped his entire right cheek off and knocked a bunch of his teeth out and he was gushing blood. 

I got tear gassed 3 times. And straight up I wasn‚Äôt even close and I was on the grass. I was peacefully yelling ‚Äúfight for Trump‚Äù as were many other millions of Americans. They incited the violence. They antagonized the crowd. Then antifa was in the front. They scaled the walls. They pushed back on the police and once they got close enough the police just let them through. This shit looked planned. To a tee. It looks orchestrated. It was like out of a movie. 

The cops let them in. Then they shot that unarmed girl at point blank. I had to go to see the truth. I had to go to see what they were doing . The media is spinning it.

@Jnvlv247,"I've seen insane rhetoric from all sides on this

""They are not patriots"" - so the ones that stand up and do something besides sit there and yell and hold flags are unpatriotic? The ones who go into a building which is supposed to the people's are the bad guys? WE all hate the current system and this symbolizes that. WHY vilify it? It may have been a bit crazy and with no clear end game but hey, I'll take it. We watched the left get there way in 2020 and cities and business destroyed for nothing. All this and some congressmen were inconveinced. WHO fucking cares?

""Threat to democracy"" - If anything, this IS democracy. This is how we became a country and how all difference have been solved. This is how countries and movements are born

""If it was BLM, they'd have been shot real quit"" - After months of riots, no police shot a BLM person. In fact most are white anyway so the white privilege narrative is foolish. A white woman was killed by police. Their race narrative is so delusional it's sad

""This makes us look bad"" - To who? And why do we care? A man and a movement who have been vilified since 2015 should care about our enemies thoughts? TDS and media manipulation is real. And who cares about what any foreign nations think? 

""Insurrection"" - Barely. As much as it was cool to see, it was hardly anything thatcaused any dents in the system. HOWEVER, it does set a precident which I hope grows. I hope we see more civil disobedience and unrest pop up over the lockdowns and statism. This is a good thing. It's our turn to really fix this. The leftists don't want to. They think they are set now. Some may want anarchy still as they don't like biden but at the end of the day they want the system shut down just like maga.

Tyrants only can be subdued by force. neville chambelain tried with hitler. look how that turned out.  we are at war, its here. this is not a normal election cycle. the elections are rigged. while all of the internet pontificators still have their homes and way of life they say stop the violence. we are better then this. its not until they take your source of income like they are taking others that you will respond correctly. WAKE UP AND STAND BEHIND YOUR PEOPLE. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND HISTORY WILL REPEAT. The girl killed by capital police should be like the shot heard round the world BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING REDRESS AND JUSTICE. PUT THE BLAME WHERE IT BELONGS. ON THE BROKEN DC TYRANTS AND GLOBALISTS. NOT ON THE JUST PEOPLE SEEKING FAIR REDRESS AND GETTING NONE.. as horrible as violence and war is. they will not listen to any redress. the time is now. learn your history or you are doomed to repeat it.

Don't you think it's very odd that now today all of a sudden the left is calling for Trump to be impeached when he literally had nothing to do with this anyways? Why is everything always Trump's fault even somehow covid is his fault which makes no sense at all! How could he be at fault for China, for Italy for Britain and all the other countries all over the world that was hit even harder than us??? Seriously? Come on people and of course now Twitter and Facebook have banned Trump because they're trying to silence him and censor him because they know he's about to expose the truth a bunch of corrupt and evil hypocrites just watch and see these next four years are about to be the worst you've ever seen and you're gonna be begging Trump to come save you but he will be nowhere to be found because he's sick of this twisted garbage against him",0,2021-01-07T21:18:43Z,2021-01-07T21:18:43Z

@John-ok8ts,Let's be honest. This is the last election the GOP had a chance of winning for decades. America will become like California. Eventually the people who support the Democrats may come to their senses and realize they are propping up corporations and the 1% just like GOP voters have now done. If you are a Trump supporter it's time to smile and nod and forsake elections until there's people worth voting for. The die is cast. Creating more discontent only gives the Democrat machine someone to blame and use as a scapegoat. As for Trump and his supporters. It's time to leave the big social media platforms. If I was a Trump supporter serving in the military I would leave now before they send me off to some dusty country to kill people that did me no harm for their economic globalist interests.,0,2021-01-07T21:05:15Z,2021-01-08T13:52:45Z

@RLDRemembrance,"You know what would be crazy!?!?

 If ""Trump Supporters"" ability to get in (lack of security) was the alleged """"deep state"""" sending the politicians a message, and why those who didn't are being crucified today. 

I mean they looked so terrified.

No matter what side of the isle you are on, it is important to see the way everyone is being manipulated and blatant gaslighting and false equivalency to perpetuate a false narrative as the following is absolutely true on both sides. 

There is NO CORRALATION between the events that transpired yesterday to the reality or lack thereof of voter fraud. NONE. 

Either they pivoted because they never believed voter fraud was real, or they pivoted to send people a message ""they"" are in control of everything regardless of truth, reality, morals, ethics or integrity and they don't answer to any form of civil uprising and will be punished for any attempt to do so beyond reason or corralation. Both at your expense by establishment democrats and republicans, the message was NOT to Trump, it was to YOU. 

One of the two above MUST be true. Regardless of which one you believe to be true, you were in fact completely and unequivocally 100% manipulated.

Finally, being Pro-America doesn't mean anti-nonwhite and to even suggest that may be true makes you the racist as proclaiming your interpretation than any none white is Un-American. I am as American as any white person and defend my values as such. You telling me when someone says ""America First"" doesn't include me makes you the obvious racist.

Exhibit A you have been lied to for 4 years; 

Whether or not you believe in a ""Deep State"" Trump supporters have been fighting against, how many black and brown people are in the alleged deep state in question? 

EXACTLY.

If I was actually attached to this, trust and believe I'd rather be shot and killed at the capital than roll over to this BS, but it's your world, do what you will with it.

It was obvious to us that she had not been exposed to any tear gas. She hadn't been crying and did not look irritated.

IF the Congress refuses to address an act of war against The People, IF the courts REFUSE to hear any legal challenges to the rulings of the conspirators, WHAT IS LEFT? AND, to call yesterdays event in D.C. ""violence"" is a real stretch. I was there. It was NOT a riot unless by ""riot"" you mean a protest in which there was NO looting, NO arson, NO ONE injured by the protestors, NO property destruction except perhaps a broken window. One woman was shot BY POLICE, for who knows what reason? FACT: we now know, BEYOND ANY DOUBT, that the ruling oligarchical plutocracy does not give a shit about The People, about the rule of law, about the Constitution, except how they can manipulate all those factors to their own advantage and profit.

They stir outrage and even open hate and it's ""You better vote for us because THEY HATE YOU! We said so!"" They stir up that mob mentality in their voters and voters are making choices out of blind rage or fear. Once the democrats get into power, historically, they couldn't continue to feed that mob. The mob stopped coming out for them and they would lose to the GOP and that returned them to the cycle of mob stirring and you need us in power. Now, we have a new radical left that might not fall into that pattern. They could very well push the DNC to out right authoritarian/identity driven government that America will not accept. With the worry of elections gone because we now have Venezuelan style rigged elections how else will the DNC maintain the mob that got them into power? They will have to feed them on Trumpism or anyone who objects or speaks up. Unless we get off this path and that requires MASSIVE abandonment of the establishment parties and a take over of new parties that recognize the rule of law and our Constitution, we will see fighting in the streets. You can preach non-violence all day and night but if one side uses violence and the government it owns allows that violence and unfairly applies law against the victims of the violence then what other course do you have? Non-violence means you simply lay down and stick your head through the guillotine. We will be blamed and labeled even arrested even if we DON'T use violence.

They then won every branch of government after all of that.

Our people broke a window and it's literally 9/11 and Pearl Harbor rolled into one.

This was not a Political Coo or in any way an attempt to overthrow our government but rather this was an attempt to get their attention. Many of us feel that the Democrats went around the Constitution when these states allowed people other than legislators to implement changes in the way people can vote. Those changes are unconstitutional because only legislatures are empowered under our Constitution to make those changes and we demand that this gets turned around and that this election is in 100% complete compliance with our Constitution.
Democrats are blocking every effort to prove voter fraud and as everyone knows , innocent people want any and all evidence brought to light. Only guilty criminals suppress evidence.
Every person in our American Government is only a Public servant that we the people have elected to represent us. Democrats now think they are our rulers. Their attitude is going to cause conflict and trouble and ultimately be their downfall. Our system works because Americans believe in our Constitution.

@FWAMUG,"I have always said that violent rioting is wrong. Anyone who knows me also knows that I have made the statement that the people who are ignoring what the extreme left was doing and covering up for their unacceptable behavior was going to learn the hard way the the extreme right was going to start doing the same activities. The complete and utter idiots in the mainstream corporate media and the Democratic party in this country who would not absolutely denounce the violence bein perpetrated by the extreme left are unfortunately going to learn a historical truth.
That truth is that the extreme left, Communism used violence and murder to take over countries, disarmed the populace and enslaved their people using secret police and death camps that they called re-education camps.
The extreme right, also known as the National Socialist Party of Germany (NAZI) used violence and murder to take over their country, disarmed the populace and enslaved their people using secret police and death camps that they called concentration camps.
Anyone who studies history knows that the corporate main stream media of the day covered up the atrocities that Adolf Hitler and his NAZI party committed while millions of people died.
That same main stream media covered up the atrocities that Joseph Stalin and his Communist party committed while millions of people died.
The reality is that both the extreme left and the extreme right use exactly the same methods and end up with exactly the same results. The really sad thing is the one institution that our founding fathers built into our government, freedom of the press, has done more in the last 200 years to try and destroy our country and way of live which has given more people freedom and helped more people get out of poverty than any civilization in the known history of the human race.
Do not take my word for it. Go research the facts and learn it for yourself and most definitely do not take the ""main stream"" presses word on anything becuase they have proven that the only thing they want to do is push a political agenda that they think will leave them in charge.
Study, check the facts, knowledge is power, freedom is power but also requires that you take responsibility for your own actions.
I listen to Dave Rubin because he is thoughtful and usually has his facts straight. That does not mean I take what he says at face value any more than I take the main stream media at face value but most of the time Dave is not trying to ""blow sunshine up my skirt"" to distract me and take my freedom away like the main stream media does.",0,2021-01-07T20:05:24Z,2021-01-07T20:05:24Z
