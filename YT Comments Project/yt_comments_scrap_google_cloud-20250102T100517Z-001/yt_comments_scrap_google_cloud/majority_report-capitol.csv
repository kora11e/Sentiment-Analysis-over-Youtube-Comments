@ronnantab,The shooting video shows the shooter wearing a blazer.  Is that police or secret service?  Emma's comment that security shot seems more accurate than Sam saying Capitol Police.  More logical that Secret Service was not as lax as the Capitol Police and so when the women breached whoever they were protecting (Pence? Pelosi? Others?) they shot and neutralized the attacker.  Shot in the neck suggests higher level of training also.,0,2021-01-09T04:28:36Z,2021-01-09T04:28:36Z

If removed by an impeachment conviction Congress does have the constitutional authority to disqualify that person from future office. However, there have been occasions when Congress has decided not to disqualify someone from future office.

If Trump was to be impeached and convicted, his ability to run in 2024 would depend on whether Congress decided to disqualify him or not.

Maybe it's not appropriate to tell you my evolution of thought in the same space as a an apology yet you might find it interesting.
When the protesters turned into rioters by going through police blockades on to the Capitol grounds where our leaders were in session, I thought: the police don't seem to be putting up a big fuss about it. I also thought there are strong laws in that area for people not wandering around with guns. I also thought this crowd of protesters/rioters must be under very close physical scrutiny, after all everybody knew there would be a protest there and the security of our leaders in the Capitol must be extensive and smart. I also thought it was good to see cops dealing with protesters/rioters without brutalizing like last year. 
So I incorrectly assumed that the cops were just doing thier job as planned and they must have it under control. The whole thing was just way more insidious than I thought so I was an idiot to blab calm down/take a breath.  I'm sorry.",1,2021-01-08T00:47:40Z,2021-01-08T00:47:40Z

@Lasselucidora,"The president leads an attack. Police opens the doors.  White people can take over. 50 charges.  For being out late.

You have power to take him away as quick as Twitter did. But you do not. What a shi/t country.
Instead the ""leaders"" want to speak big worlds during 10 hours.

@raygaub9861,This is what happens when liberals don't join with socialists. This fate was sealed after Obama 08' failed to deliver hope and change followed up by the willful choice to do everything but join and support Bernie in 16' and 20'.
