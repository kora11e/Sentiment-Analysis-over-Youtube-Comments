@anthonymerchant2597,"It's interesting how little Sandy says she is receiving all of these comments when these platforms remove any comments that say a word against her. I as a disabled Army Veteran with PTSD can't even criticise her for claiming she now has a serious condition that takes us Vets sometimes years to prove. That she is an emotionally stunted spoiled overgrown child who lacks any real world experience. She has no qualifications or experience to even discuss the issues that she does regularly. My wife who is Puertorican herself, says that she gives a terrible impression of other Puertoricans. She has no understanding of the scientific method or technology yet acts like she does. She talks about businesses yet hasn't even been a manager in one in her life. She acts like she knows what the situation at the southern border is like when I was raised near it unlike her. She is driven by her emotions and her narracisitic need for attention. She may not be evil but she is incredibly manipulative and deceitful. It's disturbing to see that someone that self absorbed honestly thinks she is a public servant representing the people. She can't manage to get over her ego to see anything past her own personal agendas. I honestly don't get how anyone above a elementary school level of education would listen to someone who has little to no concept of the real world. Why would anyone believe her when she has proven that lying is the only thing that she can accomplish? Also I have known multiple Therapist and Psychologists inside and outside of the VA who deal with PTSD everyday. One of the common issues that everyone with PTSD seems to have is having a lot of attention. This is why many Vets and even others have very limited social interactions at all. Many of us self isolate from the rest of the world, not go on social media to claim to be a victim. In fact many Vets including myself don't even like to admit that we have it and despise it when someone refers to it as a mental disability. For that reason alone I will never see her as anything more than a spoiled child.",0,2022-06-01T02:44:33Z,2022-06-01T02:44:33Z

You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is facing criticism over initial claims she made about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with many noting that she wasn't even in the Capitol when it occurred.

The controversy erupted after the New York congresswoman posted a video in which she described a confrontation with Capitol Police at her office, which is located on the larger Capitol complex. But it is not in the Capitol itself ‚Äî which includes the dome, the House, and the Senate ‚Äî and was where many rioters stormed in and were seen breaking windows.

Her office is located in the Cannon building, which is accessible through underground tunnels connected to the Capitol as well as via a short stroll down a walkway and across the street. It was also one of the buildings where staff was told to evacuate after suspicious packages were found in the area. Law enforcement found pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails in the vicinity.",0,2022-05-31T05:21:17Z,2022-05-31T05:21:17Z

No way the Bar Tender beats out that many people for the role. Based on this performance, she would have trouble cracking the cast of one of those ""Real Wives of fill in the blank"" shows. 

Now, to be fair, I really haven't watched much of her previous performances so maybe she has delivered Oscar level performances in the past.

Wish I could've got my ptsd from such a small incident. 

Here's i got initially got ptsd.......

1st Battalion 8th Marines. MOS 0317 MCSS.
Second battle of Fallujah November 7th - December 23.
117 Search and destroy weapon cache missions in Kandahar.
Battle of Ganjgal Valley. Marine took out many Hajis with a Russian mounted machine gun on a small Toyota truck and received the CMH.
21 missions in Kabul and surrounding villages-hunt and kill strategic targets. 

Two days my debugger was over and coming back to the states for good...
 I was shot twice in the leg and chest all while holding my best friend since kindergarten on my lap while watching him shit and piss all over himself. All the while he is begging me to get his mother. 
Then I watched the pupil (he only had one eye left) dilate. 
He was one of the few Marines bodies that didn't make it back. Because after we pulled out, the Haji bastards stormed our chopper that had been shot down 23 hours prior with enemy RPG and they tie his body to pieces.
