@MH-oh8rn,Why are you all concerned about violent protest all of a sudden this crap has been going on for a long time with black lives matter movement.  In fact if this were a black lives matter group there you guys would support them . This is what happens when there is corruption going on in politics and the media reports nothing but propaganda.  This mess is way bigger than a Trump problem  sites like this are one of our problems also nothing but a bunch a propaganda.  Deep corruption on both sides Joe and his side kick are amongst them totally ridiculous.,0,2021-01-08T01:59:25Z,2021-01-08T01:59:25Z
@vidstoday671,"I don‚Äôt agree that all republicans are evil and racist but think that what happened at the capitol was outlandish, nearsighted, moot and a huge disgrace. I also think that sometimes tyt tries to demonize people that are different for more viewers. I wish we could let go of the identity politics and truly be progressive by both sides meeting in the middle. The media only portrays extreme left and extreme right. Talk to those around you and abroad and you will find that the majority are in the middle and very reasonable to debate with.",1,2021-01-08T01:40:09Z,2021-01-08T01:40:09Z

@literfluid5028,"Someone asked ""Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?"" 

Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response:

""A few things spring to mind.

Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.

For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace - all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.

I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.

And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface.

Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.

Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.

And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.

Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.

He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.

He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.

That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.

There are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:
* Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.
* You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.

After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.

God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.

He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.

In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.

And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:

'My God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created?

If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.""",1,2021-01-07T09:25:02Z,2021-01-07T09:25:02Z

@literfluid5028,"Something to make us all smile.

Copied from Ed Goldner

An Obituary.

Disgraced former President Trump died today of congestive heart failure while serving a 20 year sentence in the Federal penitentiary. He is survived by his three sons and two daughters, three of which were unavailable for comment due to their own incarceration. Single at the time of his death, none of his ex-wives made any comment fit to print.  

Mr. Trump was believed to be a billionaire at the time of his election as President, but civil, government, and criminal investigations while he was President revealed he was actually billions of dollars in debt. Those same investigations led to his Impeachment and Removal from the Presidency and his Federal and New York State convictions. Mr. Trump had the dubious distinction of being the only President in the history of the United States to be removed from office by Impeachment, and having to be physically removed from the White House by Secret Service when he refused to leave. 

After removal, Mr. Trump was indicted, tried and convicted in Federal Court and in the State Court of New York for abuse of power, Campaign Finance violations, obstruction of justice, tax fraud, and other corruption related charges. His brand collapsed when anyone who could afford to stay in his hotels refused to stay there, and his political base of voters didn't have the funds to do so either. His companies were forced into bankruptcy and were finally bought up by a consortium of buyers headed by former President Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 

Mr. Trump's partial term of office is considered by historians to be the most destructive in American history. The National Debt he doubled tipped the American economy and the world into depression and his self-dealing international corruption engendered international claims against the United States by nations and companies decimated by the irresponsible swath he cut in his relatively short time in office. The litigation from those claims is expected to last decades. The political divisions he exploited and the polarization he inflamed among Americans continues to this day though abated by new government leadership. Mr. Trump single handedly caused the implosion of the Republican party. The election of 2020 decimated the ranks of GOP leaders and public trust of the party is at next to zero.

Despite the collapse of his brand, the loss of his businesses, the disgrace of removal and convictions of felonies, Mr. Trump was defiant and divorced from reality to the end. He could be heard yelling from his cell at all hours about the injustices imposed on him and the great successes he was in business, in his personal life, and as President. At the end, no one was listening to his lies and distortions but Mr. Trump. And all of us wish everyone had stopped listening long before.",2,2021-01-07T09:24:50Z,2021-01-07T09:24:50Z

US LEGAL DEFINITION OF TREASON: Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

US LEGAL DEFINITION OF TERRORISM:
Section 802 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Pub. L. No. 107-52) expanded the definition of terrorism to cover """"domestic,"""" as opposed to international, terrorism.   A person engages in domestic terrorism if they do an act ""dangerous to human life"" that is a violation of the criminal laws of a state or the United States, if the act appears to be intended to:  (i) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping!",0,2021-01-07T07:43:46Z,2021-01-07T07:43:46Z

@nickspinner1850,"Is the following correct?  I'm not sure I can believe this!  Please correct me if I am clearly wrong on any point below.  A couple of days ago I hear the President of the United States of America essentially trying to extort fellow Republican elected officials of the State of Georgia, then I see DC police apparently cooperating with ""protesters"" who want to get into the Capitol building in a situation that sure looks like a coup d'etat, and some of these people had similar plans to those arrested for conspiring to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, put her on trial, and execute her.  There were news reports a couple days ago that the National Guard was supposed to be present today to prevent this sort of thing; where were they?  Did the President order them to stand down?  One of these ""protesters"" planted some sort of device in the House; has that been confirmed?

Then I hear the President speak, perhaps while one woman who protested on his behalf lie dying of a gunshot wound, tell these people he loves them and that they are ‚Äúvery special.‚Äù  There was no condemnation of their actions.  And he tells them that they need to continue the ""fight"" because he won the election by a landslide and it was stolen from him.  Apparently, Vice President Pence had to order the National Guard in (or another report is that cabinet members had to please or threaten to resign immediately), and now there are news reports that the President is ‚Äúout of his mind.‚Äù  This is the same President who talked of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù because some propterty was damaged during protests he did not approve of, but in this case at least some of these people wanted to hurt or kill members of Congress because they either do not like their political views or because they believe in a conspiracy theory that lacks any theory, so to speak (as the many Court decisions have illustrated).

@magne7771,"I just want to say one thing. People like mcconnell have it in their best interest to not _allow_ us to talk about the root of the issue.

Because they've screwed with the political system SO MUCH, that only THEY can decide whether or not to remove someone from their club. If they're 'just' voted out, they'll ignore those votes. If that politician/lobbyist/asshole crosses the _club,_ THEN they're out.

Things are so utterly twisted, the _only_ possible 'ten year solution' to all these problems america has? Would be violence. Would be the utter removal of EVERY one of these assholes at once. Regardless of how, so long as they are _all_ unable to do what they've done, and so long as those that fill their seats, do so _in utter terror_ of what should happen to them, should they even _consider_ stepping out of line... THAT is where you people have been at, _since before bush and the republicans robbed Gore of the presidency._

You really _can't_ talk about the truth if the situation without it veering on the edge of stochastic terrorism. Because that's what it takes, and they _know_ they can vilify us for it. But when the goon squads are out, enforcing _their_ will... It's the same old shit. You said it yourself. They won't even admit that these are TERRORISTS. Because a lot of their supporters sympathize with them. If you call them terrorists you threaten the facade that your power requires ANY support whatsoever from the populace. Because all that's left, are the lunatics on the frontlines, and the heinous, reprehensible, avoidant scum that surround them.",1,2021-01-07T02:52:00Z,2021-01-07T02:52:00Z

@patrickmeyers4246,"I am not a US Citizen, but an observer. The historical, philosophical foundations of John Locke imbued in the US Constitution were born out of conflict. The bloody revolutionary war that gave birth to the USA as a political state cost many thousands of lives. People fought and died for the principle of fair representation and the franchise to vote as a self governing republic. The concept of the individual franchise and the right to vote, ought to be held sacred. The right to vote and be represented is a key Tennent of US citizenship, as it is in other democratic states. The melting pot that is the united State also has its origins in the displacement of persecuted people,be it the pilgrims or refugees or those seeking the freedoms and promise inherent in the American culture, and sung about in the US National anthem, and continually repeated throughout history in great oratory speeches by the likes of Lincoln at Gettysburg. These principles are held dear, and should not be violated. Donald Trump either has no sense of what it is to be an American, or more likely disregards these principles for personal gain, and more insulting tries to disguise it as Nationalism. He is a criminal attempting to steal franchise rights paid for in blood so many years ago.

@tanyawales5445,"It's time for Pence to grow a pair and put Article 25 Section 4 of the Constitution into effect:

The 25th Amendment, proposed by Congress and ratified by the states in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, provides the procedures for replacing the president or vice president in the event of death, removal, resignation, or incapacitation.  The Watergate scandal of the 1970s saw the application of these procedures, first when Gerald Ford replaced Spiro Agnew as vice president, then when he replaced Richard Nixon as president, and then when Nelson Rockefeller filled the resulting vacancy to become the vice president.  Read more from the Congressional Research Service here....

Amendment 25 Section 4.
Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.
Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.

Option 2 is the quickest way using a majority of the Congress. With today's near death experience I am certain that the Congress will vote for this. VP Pence can use metal illness, drug addiction (Adderal) and dementia/Alzheimer's on the part of the President as the reason for his stating the President is incapacitated. This will get Trump out of the way for the rest of his term.",0,2021-01-07T00:23:08Z,2021-01-07T00:23:08Z
@SmegInThePants,"They will see this is a success, however badly for them it ends.  It'll create villains that they'll see as heroes.   It'll become right wing folklore.  It will embolden them in the future.  No matter how much it fails they'll just see it as strategic errors that need to be improved upon next time.  Radicalization will surge, even if only in the background.  No shortage of snake oil salesmen who will capitalize on fears and anger, fanning the flames, some of whom will be elected officials themselves, using this very incident as their new dog whistle going forward.  

I would absolutely love to be wrong.  I can hope that once their pied piper is gone that they'll be less emboldened and less willfully blind to indisputable facts.  Nothing wrong w/disputing facts, w/being skeptical, and investigating facts to corroborate them, good journalists for instance corroborate their facts before reporting them as a matter of procedure (the good ones that is) - but there *is* something wrong w/refusing to accept reality even after transparent investigation by unbiased parties verify those facts.  If you can't even imagine a fictional scenario that could possibly get you to admit you are wrong about something, whatever the subject matter, whichever side of an issue you are on, then you are off the deep end, you are dogmatic, closed minded w/an iron door.  Democrats need to be less afraid to call out things for what they are.  Less afraid of confrontation.  Scratch that, The People, of all political stripes, need their elected officials, of all political stripes, to be less afraid to stand up for rule of law (actual rule of the actual laws that are actually on the books that is), even against members of their own party.   Less tribalistic, or in the very least to consider their tribe to be all of america.  And we obviously need better ways to hold our elected accountable for their actions and failures.  

And more transparency.  If I'm a fear monger, it will be more difficult for me to get you to believe crazy conspiracy theories about politician X the more free and easy and trusted and well known access you have to relevant information about politician X, including his communications, donors, campaign funds, property holdings, all in one easy to access free to access place.  

I can't believe I miss the days when 'crazy right wing' just meant the religious zealots who wanted prayer in schools, to dictate who could get married, to gut federal programs, etc...  Oh how naive we were to think that was such a problem.",0,2021-01-07T00:22:23Z,2021-01-07T00:22:23Z

@mpemberton7760,"The DoD denied a request to deploy the NG when a lunatic mob has stormed into the Capitol and threatened public officials???  Capitol police and reinforcements not engaged in a swift and forceful response to this domestic terrorism threat???
But of course this isn't BLM or Antifa or a left-wing protesters. This isn't Lafayette Square or Kenosha or St. Louis or Portland. No tear gas, no water cannons, no cracking skulls, no unidentified Federal goon squads dragging people off the streets and tossing them into unmarked vehicles, no MRAPs, no paramilitary units.....hell, was anybody even ARRESTED? 
Because these are white folks, patriots, Red Caps, Trump supporters, True Believers, revolutionaries. They're only exercising their 1A rights, even if they're doing it ""the wrong way,"" and upsetting the status quo establishment. The president has asked them nicely to go home, reassuring them that he loves and appreciates them for taking the fight all the way to the chambers of Congress. 
He's been watching it all unfold from his ivory tower, loving every minute of chaos and terrorism and sedition that he encouraged his cult to unleash upon his enemies. It must have been a beautiful thing for him to see the official certification of electoral votes suddenly turn into a scene of utter mayhem and terror. 
This isn't about partisan politics anymore. This is a declaration of war on democracy by Trump, his Republican sycophants, and the insane right-wing extremists that worship him like a god.

In the UK we just don't have  these problems .Why? because like in the state of Alaska we still for all our elections have paper ballots which is what you should go back to everywhere , the  proper eligibility of mail in ballots is checked meticulously and regularly and candidates parties are fully able to observe with a police presence without obstruction that the votes are being  being properly counted for as long as they don't interfere. They can even mutually agree to a recount if its wafer thin margins.

NOBODY, or extremely rarely, questions the integrity of the ACTUAL ELECTION RESULT(S).!!

The PROCESS by which candidates in a democracy are elected must be and be seen to be ABOVE  REPROACH EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY  so that if a Republican candidate for president has been legitimately elected that is that. If a Democrat candidate for president for president has been legitimately elected that is that.

NO ONE accepting personal responsibility,  results in chaos. EVERYONE accepting, it, is the opposite, : Anarchism, which denies Authoritarians, like TheRump, opportunity to impose rulership.

@themessenger3216,"Change is coming. These letters were written for 330 million people. They were not written for 18th century society. They would help about now. What they expose is extremely progressive. They have a foundation in science thanks to Benjamin Franklin. There are over 700 of them. I'm in the final stages of editing a 250,000 word volume that illustrates about 75. The USA is where it is at today because it was founded on an alternative fact. Benjamin Franklin wanted to invent a better society. He was the singular ""creator"" of the U.S. Constitution. He had to find a way to get the sub-subcultures of slavery to find purchase in it for ratification. He knew they would read what they wanted too. He had help in this. 18th century society didn't read the fine print of just one sentence. They read the easiest sales pitch in human history being the perception of a gift of power. A literal algebraic equation in plain sight that requires no interpretation. The deplorables will always be their but I suspect the ""middle"" will shift about 10 points to the left. Most will still want to be patriots. A thing learned can be un-learned if truth is to have any say in the matter..

@steveh721,"This insanity now was instigated by years of disinformation and outright Orwellian lies propagated by the Trump administration, Fox News, other right-wing information outlets, and, to some extent, corporate media.  

The Biden administration needs to resolve to charge McConnell, Trump and others with sedition, crimes against humanity, and reckless endangerment of Americans. 

Hold these seditionists accountable for their many destructive acts. If they aren't held accountable and sentenced appropriately for their various crimes, they'll believe they can get away with anything and try it again in our near future.

We're witnessing the end game of a Republican slow coup that was initiated circa 1980. As the coup was nearly complete before the 2020 elections, McConnell, Trump, et al will do anything in a desperate attempt to hold onto power to achieve a successful coup. The goal of the coup is to devolve our democratic republic to an oligarchic corporatocracy! 

This is sedition, and the seditionists have abdicated their oaths of office. They include right-wing Republicans (McConnell, other members of Congress, Trump, illegitimate members of the SCOTUS), some lobbyists and some corporate Democrats. By their actions, they have asserted their loyalty to ALEC, their corporate puppeteers (Kochs, Mercers, multinational corporations, et al), and establishing a corporatocracy, while undermining our social democratic republic and disregarding the needs of Americans at ANY cost. This includes the high cost of environmental destruction, of disregarding climate change. of wars for oil and profit, of social injustices, and much more.

Play hardball. Hold these seditionists accountable for their many destructive acts. 

The Biden administration needs to charge McConnell, Trump and others with sedition, crimes against humanity, and reckless endangerment of Americans. Furthermore, the Biden administration could encourage the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to charge McConnell and Trump with crimes against humanity, and consequently be tried by the ICJ.",0,2021-01-06T22:05:28Z,2021-01-06T22:05:28Z

I condemned it this type of violence  twitter and literally I was called out for being a unamerican. these people are unamericans okay and before you start saying ""oh Democrats never did the same thing ""bullshit."" I do not want to hear that literally for years guys been saying ""oh Russia hacked the election"" and then literally blamed for burnt down buildings all year long so I don't want to hear it I think both sides are just horrible and the fact that Hollywood celebrities are saying that they never did nothing wrong and they are celebrating Joe Biden right now just for the things he said. that's another cult right there. the Democrat Hollywood cult members right there that is what they are they are literally bringing race into this bringing basically everything into this matter two cult members two very dangerous cult members and it's getting out of hand this is absolutely bad and Trump did condemn this he did say on Instagram that to be peaceful to go home now. This is how a civil war is going to start both sides they're blaming each other for things I think they're both in the wrong here I honestly do Hollywood celebrities in particular they are shaming these people instead of not telling them to get the hell out of the capital but instead they're saying them and then celebrating Joe Biden that is not how you use your platforms Hollywood celebrities and also who saw this coming like really who didn't we've been stuck in our houses all year long people are losing their minds and it's insane it is I'm sorry but yeah it's it's bad",0,2021-01-06T21:50:49Z,2021-01-06T21:55:55Z
@Stud_muffin,I'm amazed that there were only a handful of Capitol hill police protecting the Capitol.  This is all part of Trump's plan to stall and/or change the electoral voting.  This is like plan E.  A: the courts B: voting officials C: Pence change vote D: Get Congress to stall with a commission E: Insight riot/ siege of the Capitol building.  At the least he should be censured since the Senate has no spine  for impeachment.  Maybe his endgame is 25th amendment so that Pence can issue him a pardon.   The world is watching and this is a very sad day in American history.  His daughter tweeted they were patriots.  God.,2,2021-01-06T21:50:45Z,2021-01-06T21:50:45Z

@factchecker1291,"I called this 4 years ago ... nothing operates in a vacuum.  Four years ago, Hillary lost ... it is what it is.  But instead of just accepting the loss like Gore did back when Bush wrongfully won, the movement in the Hillary campaign was to march in protest, screaming ""Not My President"" in front of Trump Tower, etc.  

Four years ago, I told my sister that the public reacting like this is wrong, because all it is going to do is set a precedent for a bigger uprising 4 years later.  Four years ago, I told my sister that the next time a president loses, idiots aren't just going to chant ""not my president"", but instead there will be shots fired and people killed.  And today, it happened.  It was stupid then, and it is more stupid now ... and again, nothing operates in a vacuum.  So today, shots were fired.  Four years from now, there will be bombs, military, etc.  It only scales ... it only gets bigger.  This is why you have to take a step back and think before you act.  You never know what it will lead to in the future.  

Trump is the biggest part of this .. but those who chose to go nuts with the ""Not My President"" concept four years ago set the precedent for what happened today.",0,2021-01-06T21:46:18Z,2021-01-06T21:46:18Z

@agentorangecb1,"This is just like a third world dictatorship. A minority ignores democratic process and overthrows the will of the people

 The 'leader of the free world' doesn't believe in freedom when it doesn't match his agenda. No evidence whatsoever of fraud, just violence, intimidation, illegal acts and baseless claims. 

Clearly, this is a distraction from the phone call where Trump completely undermined freedom. He didn't ask for a recount in all states or a redo of the election,  he asked for a specific number of fabricated votes, without explaining how that would work or how it impacts a democratic system.

Conspiracy theorists - Mark my words. The reality you need to question is this counter-narrative that undermines society, facts and well-meaning investigative journalism. 

Questioning is good but if you don't question the counter narrative, the baseless claims and the motives of corrupt, power-hungry Republicans with a history of corruption and lying then turning 180... then Im sorry but you are a stupid, ignorant pawn of the system yourself

All the MONEY and stock market manipulation IN THE WORLD won't buy legitimacy. All the contrary facts you can imagine won't convince us that you care about freedom and anyone but yourself.

Disrupting legal and political processes? Yay!! How much taxpayer money do you think this will cost?! Why not go protest against people dying in hospital? Why not declare yourselves politicians, police officers and demi-gods? Why respect Democracy or people doing their jobs ever again? I'm going to punch the woman in the DMV, stab my kid's teacher and go headbutt a nurse because they're part of the system and DEEP STATE!
