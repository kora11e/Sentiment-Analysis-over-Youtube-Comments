@lionkurdi,"Please protect the Kurds from Erdogan and his ISIS militias. Their bombing of us does not stop and our children are scared. We have given thousands of martyrs in our war with ISIS to protect the world and live in peace. Now Erdogan is gathering them to take revenge on us. “Is this our reward? Where are the morals of the American and Western governments? We no longer trust you. You are handing us over to die after we fiercely defended you, humanity and ourselves so that you can enjoy safety. No one trusts you anymore because you easily dispense with your allies and those who fought with you. Ahmad, at least transfer our children to America or Europe and we will fight and defend our land against terrorism and Turkey.”",0,2024-12-18T22:24:02Z,2024-12-18T22:24:02Z

@MatchingNetwork,"THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENING :

The People's Revolution: Syria’s Struggle for Freedom
Syria, the cradle of ancient civilizations and a crossroads of religions, has always been a land of diversity and resilience. Its history tells the story of a united people bound by a shared heritage yet burdened by external invasions and internal struggles. In 2011, Syria reached a defining moment that reshaped its narrative—a revolution against decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad regime.

The Legacy of Tyranny
The Assad family rose to power in 1970 when Hafez al-Assad seized control in a military coup. For over three decades, Hafez ruled Syria with an iron fist, establishing a regime built on fear, surveillance, and brutal repression. His son, Bashar al-Assad, took power in 2000, raising hopes for reform. However, those hopes quickly faded as Bashar continued the oppressive policies that had suffocated the Syrian people for decades.

The regime’s methods became infamous for their cruelty: torture chambers, enforced disappearances, and a judiciary serving only the regime’s interests. Facilities like Sednaya Prison became synonymous with brutality, where thousands were tortured or executed without trial. The regime also engaged in organ trafficking, the systematic rape of detainees, and countless crimes against humanity. Under this shadow, Syrians lived in silence, too fearful to demand their most basic rights.

The Spark of Revolution
In March 2011, inspired by the Arab Spring, peaceful protests began in the southern city of Daraa. Citizens demanded political reforms, freedom, and an end to corruption. The regime responded swiftly and brutally, unleashing bullets, arrests, and torture on the protesters. The uprising quickly spread across the country, fueled by decades of pent-up anger against the regime.

Syrians from all religious and ethnic backgrounds united in their demand for freedom. Christians, Muslims, Druze, Alawites, and others stood together, emphasizing that their struggle was not sectarian but humanitarian. They chanted, ""We are one people,"" rejecting the regime’s narrative that the revolution was a terrorist conspiracy.

The War and Weapons of Lies
The regime framed the revolution as a war on terrorism, exploiting global fears of extremism to justify its actions. It bombed residential neighborhoods with barrel bombs, killing thousands indiscriminately. Reports of mass graves and atrocities, such as those in Sednaya Prison, shocked the world. Yet, the international community hesitated, paralyzed by conflicting interests.

Bashar al-Assad also turned to the Captagon trade, flooding the region with illicit drugs to finance his war. As cities burned and millions were displaced, the regime profited, transforming Syria into a hub for drug trafficking.

The Voice of the People
Syrians have repeatedly stated that their revolution is not a civil war but a struggle against a regime that betrayed its people. ""We have no quarrel with the world,"" said a resident of Damascus. ""Our only fight is with Bashar al-Assad, who turned against his nation."" Syrians, who once lived harmoniously across sects and religions, rejected the regime’s propaganda portraying them as divided.

""We want life, not death. Freedom, not chains,"" said a Christian activist from Damascus. ""For 55 years, this family has ruled us through terror. But we, the Syrian people, have chosen our destiny. This is our revolution.""

A Sinister Agenda
Syria’s strategic location and history as a cradle of prophets and peace have made it a target of competing global interests. Many Syrians believe there is a deliberate effort to distort their image and label them as terrorists to justify repression and global indifference. While the international community welcomed millions of Syrian refugees, it failed to address the root cause of their suffering: the Assad regime.

""This is not just about us,"" argued a displaced Syrian academic. ""It’s about humanity. Our struggle is like George Floyd’s case or any fight against oppression. If the world continues to remain silent, it becomes complicit in the crimes of this dictator.""

Hope Amid the Ruins
Despite the immense suffering, Syrians have not given up. A transitional government formed by opposition forces represents a glimmer of hope. It promises accountability for the regime’s crimes and a future built on peace and coexistence. Syrians urge the world to visit their country, speak to its people, and witness their resilience firsthand.

""To those who doubt us, meet the families who have lost everything,"" said a merchant from Aleppo. ""Speak to the teachers, artists, and traders. They will tell you this revolution is ours—it is not something imposed on us.""

A Call to Action
Please support our revolution because we want to live our lives. It is hard to see the world watching in silence. Friends, we never forgot George Floyd, and we were the first to rise against crimes. Now, it is your turn to help us and support our revolution. We are not terrorists; we are the 12 million Syrians scattered across the globe as doctors, engineers, and professionals. We come from 14 cultures and religions, living together on this land for over 1,000 years.

The Syrian people call on the world to investigate the crimes of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, from mass graves to torture and abuse in his prisons. They demand accountability for chemical weapon use, the destruction of homes, and the displacement of millions. Syrians seek justice, not vengeance, and peace, not endless war.

As a group of Christians , Muslims , Jews , Kurds , Assyrian , DRUZ  from Damascus said, ""We are the nation of jasmine, the land of coexistence. This is not just a Syrian struggle; it is a fight for the soul of humanity. Stand with us.""",0,2024-12-16T19:39:53Z,2024-12-16T19:39:53Z

@brktny,"When the opposition's offensive restarted, everyone, including CNN, immediately brought up Turkey. This was because no one believed the offensive would succeed, and many feared massacres due to the opposition's jihadist links. Headlines like ""Turkey-backed opposition forces"" dominated the media, aiming to politically blame Turkey for any outcomes. However, after Damascus fell, Turkey was no longer mentioned. Even documentaries covering the entire revolution barely referenced Turkey. The fact is, Turkey was the only country that consistently supported Syrians and the Free Syrian people from the beginning to the end. The real goal here seems to be to downplay Turkey’s role in the region and to ignore the success of the Free Syrian Army’s training and equipment.

@YohannesSenay-q6y,"Let’s unite to bring freedom to Eritrea

As we witness the joy of Syrians after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, we are reminded that the fight for freedom is worth fighting for. In Eritrea, our own fight for freedom is far from over.

While it is natural to worry about the challenges that may arise after the fall of the dictator, we cannot let fear hold us back. Instead, we must work tirelessly to defeat the regime and prepare for a better future.

The time for freedom is now. Let’s make it happen!

@AngusDanu,"Here are some things Jesus Christ said of Himself.

“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” John 14:6

""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" John 3:16

""Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son."" John 3:18

 Jesus asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. Matthew 16:13-17 

 Skeptics said for centuries, ""There was no global flood"". Now many scientists are affirming there was. They said, ""The bible we have now has been corrupted through the centuries."". In 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and proved otherwise. They said, ""There's no way Israel can become a nation again as God promised in preparation for the end times."". Israel became a nation again in 1948.

 All this being said, it does require faith to believe. Hebrews 11:6 tells us, ""And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."" Also John 20:27-29 states, ""Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!” Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

 Don't be deceived, Jesus is the Son of God and the only way of being saved from God's judgement for our sin. Christ consciousness won't save you. Believing Jesus was an ascended master, a prophet or a good teacher won't save you. Romans 10:9 tells us how to be saved, ""if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved"". Trust in Him, He shed his blood and gave His perfect life for you. Call on Him, He loves you, and He hears you.",1,2024-12-09T21:56:55Z,2024-12-09T21:56:55Z

@Frankthezenguy,"The biggest difference between the govts of places like Syria, and , lets say, Saudi, is that one is willing to play ball with the usa (and Israel ) and the other wasn't. 
And so the media will paint Assad's regime as the boogey man,, talk endlessly about atrocities, discuss whether or not Assad will be ""held accountable"", etc., etc., meanwhile, in Saudi, a simple tweet that only mildly, respectfully disagrees with the govt, can get one decades in prison or even deleted from earth. Think about that.
According to our over-lords, Iran is a horrible, oppressive dictatorship, and yet Iranians have enjoyed freedoms for decades that Saudis could only dream of, and they actually participate in their govt , and can disagree without getting deleted (Iranians are very outspoken).
Like wise with Russia --I'm hearing how Putin's a monster, needs to be held accountable. Meanwhile look at what's happening in Gaza.
There's no genuine concern for ""human rights"" and ""justice"".

Two hundred ''Six million Jews'' allegations from 1900-1945

1900 - Stephen S. Wise, New York Times, June 11, 1900: ""There are 6,000,000 living, bleeding, suffering arguments in favor of Zionism."" 

1902 - Encyclopaedia Britannica, 10th Edition, Vol. 25, 1902, page 482: ""While there are in Russia and Rumania six millions of Jews who are being systematically degraded ..."" 

1902 - Samuel W. Goldstein, New York Times, November 27, 1902: ""PLEA FOR ZIONISM ... In answer I would say: Does Dr. Silverman represent the 6,000,000 Jews in Russia, 300,000 in Roumania and the 1,000,000 in Galicia?"" 

1903 - The Jewish Criterion (Pittsburgh), September 18th, 1903, page 6: "" ... six million downtrodden brethren.""

1904 - Israel Zangwill, New York Times, October 20, 1904: ""The problem does not relate to the American Jews, but to the 6,000,000 in Russia. The Russian Government has consented to allow the Jews to leave,"" 

1905 - New York Times, January 29th, 1905: ""He declared that a free and a happy Russia, with its 6,000,000 Jews, would possibly mean the end of Zionism, since the abolition of the autocracy would practically eliminate the causes that brought Zionism into existence.""

He left St. Petersburg with the firm conviction that the Russian Government’s studied policy for the “solution” of the Jewish question is systematic and murderous extermination."" 

1907 - The Jewish Criterion (Pittsburgh), October 18th, 1907, page 13: "" ... for six million people cannot emigrate. 

1908 - Deseret Evening News, March 17th, 1908: "" ... poverty, starvation and disease are the afflictions which now beset the six million Jews in that country and Roumania.""

@TrendyMarketer365,"Attention Please :) ⚠⚠
Bashar al-Assad and his regime have oppressed the Syrian people for over 24 years under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Regarding ISIS, even former U.S. President Donald Trump admitted that America and Israel played a role in creating ISIS to tarnish the image of Islam. However, ISIS is now defeated. The Syrian revolution stemmed from the suffering of oppressed people seeking freedom and rights, not foreign agendas as the regime claims.

As a Muslim Arab, I believe that what is happening in Syria is about reclaiming the rights of the oppressed Syrian people. What is taken by force can only be regained by force. I hope the spread of lies stops. Iran, Russia, and even America have military bases in Syria under the guise of fighting terrorism, but they are, in reality, stealing Syria's resources, especially its oil. This is the truth you will not hear in the news.

We Muslims are peaceful and do not harm others as Western and American media claim. We fight only those who kill our people and violate our rights. We stand with all the oppressed worldwide, regardless of their religion or beliefs.

Who welcomed the Jews after World War as refugees II? It was Palestine. Yet Britain and America supported the Israeli minority for their interests in the Middle East. You are hypocrites, and the world must know the truth: there is no Israel. Palestine is Occupied by Israel. Read the History well from 1900 and let your heart tells you the truth not the western Media !

Every oppressor in the world has an end. Don't FOORGET that ! 🇵🇸 ✌
Remember my words: Palestine will be free, as God Almighty says in the Quran:
""Permission (to fight) is given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory – (They are) those who have been evicted from their homes without right – only because they say, 'Our Lord is Allah.' And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might – (And they are) those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of (all) matters."" (Al-Hajj: 39–41)

This powerful message calls for justice, peace, and the fight against oppression.

MUST READ THE HOLY QU'RAN TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN OUR WORLD , HAVE A GOOD DAY ... 

If you cannot speak the truth, then remain silent; it is better for you !!! 


From the river to the sea Palestine will be free whether you like or not ! 😉

1905 - New York Times, January 29th, 1905: ""He declared that a free and a happy Russia, with its 6,000,000 Jews, would possibly mean the end of Zionism, since the abolition of the autocracy would practically eliminate the causes that brought Zionism into existence.""

Even American state department spokesman Jake Sullivan announced “ Al-Qaeda in Syria is on our side.” Al-Julani’s true role is hes the head of a US contracted army, serving the interests of Israel. The goal is to cut off the axis of resistance against the Israeli occupation in Palestine, but to keep the Syrian army entangled in internal conflict ready to neautralize them if an all out war errupts between Israel/ the US versus Iran. And currently the US military is illegally occupying a third of Syria, holding its oil and wheat resources and also enforcing massive economic santions on the country’s population halting vital infrastructure funding for re-building the nation.  
As soon as humanitarian corridors are created, hundreds of thousands of Syrians will flee into Europe to escape yet another US created proxy war. This is a sneaky move by the Americans and Israel. Theyve armed jihadists to cut off Hezbollahs northern corridor in Lebanon and then eventually take Damascus. This will cut the Palestinians off completely for Israel to take the entire territory in Gaza and West Bank by continuing the genocide. It could force the Iranians to join the war to save Syria which is ultimate aim by the Americans and Israel. Russia and China cannot allow the US to go to war with Iran. This could force Russia to abandon Ukraine and try to protect their last remaining ally and brics member in the middle east. The Americans are going all in with their total war ideology for regional imperalist dominance and resource control. The US NATO Empire under Obama dropped 20,000 bombs on Syria and Trump increased drone strikes on Syria by 400%. This bipartisan regime change agenda by the US has now created another Taliban 2.0 failed state like Libya and Afghanistan.  Well done US, well done 👏 🤡🤦‍♂️👏",0,2024-12-09T09:56:27Z,2024-12-09T09:56:27Z

@ky365tv,"If South Korea's President Yoon Seok-yeol is impeached, South Korea will inevitably become communist!! The reason is that opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is a spatialist who is advocating the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and praising North Korea's Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un. After President Yoon Seok-yeol took power, he realized that the entire South Korea was occupied by communists by former President Moon Jae-in, a pro-North Korea supporter, including broadcasting, media, prosecution, police, and investigative agencies. In order to correct this, he declared martial law, which is the inherent authority of the president guaranteed by the Constitution. However, even his own junior Han Dong-hoon, the party leader (a pro-China communist), whom President Yoon Seok-yeol cherished, betrayed the president and installed all of his recommended people as his shams in President Yoon Seok-yeol's cabinet, the Office of the Chief of Staff, the Ministry of Justice, and all personnel, including the Chief of Staff, when he was the Minister of Justice. Now, all of South Korea's media is occupied by the communist organization, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (the largest single labor organization presumed to be the North Korean Communist Party).  The American media believes and broadcasts to each country the reports of the communist-controlled MBC, KBS, JTBC, SBS, CBS, and other YouTuber media outlets (90% of which are communist organizations) without filtering them! Their biased reporting is serious. Right now, the rally to protect President Yoon Seok-yeol is larger in scale than the communist candlelight vigil, holding the American and Taegeukgi flags at Gwanghwamun Rhee Syngman Square, shouting for the ROK-US alliance, Jesus Korea, gospel unification, free unification, and market economy. The opposition Democratic Party, which colluded with China to become the majority party with 190 seats through a fraudulent election, is an anti-state force that has deceived the people with lies and propaganda more than 20 times and has cut the entire government budget to 0 won!  In this situation, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law to protect the free democratic Republic of Korea and the people in a situation where the country is on the verge of collapse, but the leftist soldiers are disobeying the orders of the President, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, not moving, informing the opposition party's traitorous forces, and attacking the President from the opposite side of the President. The President is banned from leaving the country by anti-state forces, is being branded as illegal martial law, and just like the witch-hunt-style impeachment of innocent President Park Geun-hye, President Yoon Seok-yeol, a believer in free democracy, is now in a situation no different from being imprisoned! In order to protect President Yoon Seok-yeol from anti-state forces, the patriotic citizens of the free Republic of Korea are fighting with tears in their eyes, holding the American and Taegeukgi flags, and with Pastor Jang Gwang-hoon at Rhee Syngman Square in Gwanghwamun for 6 years, rain or shine, against the anti-state forces, the communist Democratic Party, Moon Jae-in, Lee Jae-myung, etc. All free world media, including the United States, should not trust the media in Korea, which is occupied by communists.  Come out to Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, South Korea in person!! I urge you to meet Pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon, President Yoon Seok-yeol, and the patriotic citizens holding the American, Taegeukgi, and Israeli flags, conduct a direct interview, and then broadcast it as news. The Korean media is dead!! There is only false and distorted newsㅠ!! The president also declared martial law in order to correct this point and root out the fraudulent election, which is the flower of democracy, but then canceled martial law according to the law against anti-state forces! World! Help President Yoon Seok-yeol of the free Republic of Korea! Please help the patriotic citizens of the Taegeukgi who have fought the communists for 6 years in rain or snow at Gwanghwamun Square in the free Republic of Korea for the sake of freedom and democracy! Every week, we hold worship services on the streets, and every Saturday, we fight the communist Democratic Party (communists! Opposition Party) with tears. I appeal in the name of God!

Spend so much time blaming Israel until all the Middle East turn to chaos and upside down.

@SIM2014,"This only validates the connection between three events going back to Feb 24, 2022 where we see the connection between player 1 cause 1 with player 5 (Iran and their proxy in event 2 (oct7)) with event 3 (Syria and player 1s) Further entangling the connection to a cause outside event 1 that predates event 1 (between player 1 and 3)

SIM analysis:

Now more than ever, the focus on getting player 2 cause 1 up that pole first is the only way to shut out all other insurgents in the timeline perspective (given the latter and lateral events since and prior to event 1)

Further, the ruleset at play has a singular lead who only stands to benefit given the overall cause and condition at play where a switch of condition is required to escape the self fulfilling justification taking place (where it's symptom given the incoherence factor is high between the players declarations in connections to their actions as well as intentions*)

Finally, there is the alternate condition to be had, as kept open by the lead by rank and score, but that will only last as long as he remains on the board. 

Now the question about method of approach about outcome will be based on how (and by who) this will occur that will effect the escalation factor by order of magnitude (due to outcome.)**

[* The symptom of the g factor of the condition in dominance over the r factor. (Liken to events prior to the outbreak of ww1)]

[** And keep in mind that escalation is required for outcome. Now, the potential for the order of mangitude will be based on the follow through of the pkayers by the agreement given the condition at play. And like with BNs situation, where he has proven a violation of his opponents own agreement to the g factor of the condition (by beating them at their own game) thus proving a violation of that agreement (refusal to admitting defeat and succeed the cause to the victor as the admitted 'loser') by exposure of his opponents intention behind their primary objective with regard to the state not only of his opponent given their primary objective (with regard to the security of the state of Israel, but the state the Jewish communities threat of extinction by player 5 (Iran) as aggravated by their proxies.)]",0,2024-12-09T06:08:43Z,2024-12-09T06:08:43Z
