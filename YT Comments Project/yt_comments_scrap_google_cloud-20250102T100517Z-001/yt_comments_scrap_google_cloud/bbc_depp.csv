@Nerinav1985,"Live streaming of trial was praiseworthy.
I believe a true victim would never hesitate to tell TRUTH to the entire world. 
Justice must be public. 

Some Feminists are saying that live streaming a domestic abuse case discourages other victims to seek justice. 
Damn ...
Then settle these husband wife issues at home then! 

A truth speaker will never hesitate to speak in front of camera. 
Only a liar feels hesitation

Truth is great.

The ""me too"" movement has nothing to worry: it was  initiated for victims of dv and sv  that were TRUTHFUL about their experience. Not at all was it created to serve as a platform for imposters. Amber Heard, as you would have learned had you followed the trial, lied repeatedly, used the ""me too"" movement to add more credibility to her false accusations, and even publicly claimed that she had donated her divorce settlement of$7M (proven to be a lie!!). Timelines show that over the years she further ""added"" and embellished claims of violence. This trial was not only to finally uncover AMBER HEARD AS A RUTHLESS LIER, who showed NO REMORSE until the end, but also about how much  ""WORDS MATTER"", as does truth, BBC.

You missed the photos of Johnny's actually bruised face, the recordings of Amber cursing and laughing at Johnny and telling him no one would believe that a woman abused him if he told about it, her admitting that she hit the man etc etc. Brilliant one sided reporting. I applaud you and all the people not smart enough to watch the trial for themselves and come to their own conclusions. This really demonstrates how you can't trust the media and they can sway anything to make it seem how they want it to seem. I'm glad the trial was made public and recorded.

@rufusroher,"I don't give a shit what happened by 1 verdict by 1 judge in another country with different laws. The USA was founded because of the laws and rules of the UK. Many nations look to the US constitution as the standard for a democracy. The UK allows HEARSAY into court, we don't. The UK judge decided that Amber's LYING under oath on immigration documents & suborning the PERJURY of others with regards to those same immigration docs & the claims were NOT an indication of her ability to lie further, or the trustworthiness of her statements under oath. The UK judge then went on to believe Amber's lies to the UK court, that she donated her entire $7m divorce settlement, when the US court proved that to be FALSE...among other things she LIED under oath about. THERE WERE 7 JURORS IN THE USA TRIAL AND THEY ALL HAD TO BE UNANIMOUS FOR JOHNNY TO WIN. Much HIGHER a burden to prove than 1 JUDGE who discounted ALL of Johnny's testimony as untrustworthy due merely for the fact that he is an alcoholic & a drug addict.

Just by the facts alone, the BBC, UK lawyers, and legal analysts bringing up the UK Trial as the end all and be all on this matter when really it is the penultimate decision, shows how poorly you all understand this case....it is the worse of the 2 because 1 judge relied on lies and perjury to ground their decision vs 7 jurors listening to Johnny Depp DESPITE his personal failings and weigh his testimony and his WITNESSES on their merit.  Those 7 jurors understand that Amber was a perjurer and a liar and had FAR better common sense and understanding of this case then 10,000 UK legal analysts who site their UK judge!",0,2022-06-07T20:44:24Z,2022-06-07T20:47:59Z

@eldheimm,"80% of all suicides are committed by men. A huge amount of those are due to failed marriages and relationships with insane amounts of emotional and physical abuse from their spouses, often continuing the abuse after the relationship has ended, to escape as a victim, and blame the man for what went wrong.
On top of that, they lose child custody and are ruined financially with child support and no means to live alone in today's brutal economic landscape. 
No one talks about that at all.
No, they STILL want to talk about a woman that could possibly have been abused, even though a six-week trial showed the exact opposite.

As an American I can confidently say that y’all know NOTHING of our laws. The jury verdict is the final word. We have the right to a jury trial at anytime, Unlike the UK MeToo doesn’t hold power over the courts, Unlike the UK we don’t allow witnesses to testify behind close doors because WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO FACE OUR ACCUSERS whether they’re a party or just a witness. Unlike the UK if it was known that a judge was related to a case in someway that judge would NOT be overseeing it. Unlike the UK this trail was against Amber NOT a newspaper.

@jonnybaynham1689,"It is shocking you pretend to be impartial yet seem to repeat the same headlines and rhetoric as the Guardian.

You're not taking into account how Heard's own testimony was a series of contradictions and shocking exaggerations, the UK trial was completely different to the US trial - the judge made decisions based on evidence ultimately found to be perjury, let alone being against the Sun. And none of this coverage has looked at any evidence provided by Heard, only her testimony and the emotional allegations of her being a woman supposedly speaking on behalf of MeToo yet making accusations so loud, shocking, and graphic (without evidence) that they almost make a mockery of women and men that have experienced this in reality. And you make these comments despite her not giving any money to charities that she repeatedly said she donated, despite using the exact same photos as evidence of multiple incidents, and despite substantial evidence of her abusing Depp.

Shame on you BBC. I'm not saying condemn Heard, but how dare you gaslight Depp's case as some kind of misogynistic payback rather than his own genuine, evidence-based story",5,2022-06-07T09:10:46Z,2022-06-07T11:24:25Z
@Jen-nh7yw,"Allow me to help you, Abagail.  Here, in America, we practice that people are INNOCENT until proved guilty.  We LISTEN to the evidence BEFORE judgement.  We leave BIASES outside deliberation and ATTEMPT to share the burden so there is less opportunity to be swayed by anything other than the information provided.  In this case, the jurors did that, but the public also WATCHED FOR OURSELVES.  There were no one like you telling us to think like you and with our own minds we actually drew our own INDIVIDUAL conclusions that not only Johnny Depp was telling the truth but that the media was blowing smoke -- trying to assure we trusted them more than we trusted our own eyes and ears.  Sorry, not going to happen.  Not this time.
What you brought to light is just how desperately media figures need to influence the public instead of reporting unbiasedly what is happening.  If this is an opinion only, then my only pity is for you and those who trust you. Abagail, you clearly did not pay attention to this trial because the evidence was so overwhelming that there could be no CREDIBLE civil law system in America if the jurors return a verdict against Johnny Deep.  Or....and even worse...you DID pay attention and just don't care about facts/truth because winning your argument matters more to you than truth.  Shame on you if that's the case because the ONLY thing that can take down the ""ME TOO"" movement is to decide who is allowed to be a victim and who is excluded before we have the facts.",3,2022-06-07T08:44:55Z,2022-06-07T13:01:11Z

The jury found that she did lie about her claims and acted with actual malice, overwhelmingly judging against her on the three elements of the claim. If you want to compare it to the UK judgement read it for yourself, the judgement was incredible to me and would have been very different if heard in front of a jury as the US trial was.

Why do they completely ignore Ambers own testimony & recorded audio where she is clearly aggressive and obviously not scared & admitting to abusing him.  ""She's expected to be perfect""  wtf?  Was Johnny perfect?  I'm pretty sure her team went out of the way to prove he's far more of a mess than Amber, so then, why do we believe him & not her???  Maybe because the loads of victims know what this looks like!  These morons speaking for her are the ONLY ones chanting #metoo is dead.  Meanwhile, the other side is saying ""no, men are just included in that"".  But no, these sexist women who want to scream Misogyny but they themselves are coming off extremely sexist because they are completely blind to any of Ambers evils.  Why do we have to be fans of Johnny to see his side?  Many of us were victims & are mad after seeing this court case realize she is playing this whole movement & real victims for fools.  She wants us to believe these tiny traces of lie shes left everywhere.  Honestly, had she took 2 normal bruise photos instead of those makeup pics we're squinting to see red on... to believe he was wailing on you with hard hits regularly?  The australia incident alone... as described... the fact she had NOT A SINGLE INJURY photo of but scribble everywhere blew her lies to bits.  That would have been so easy to get a photo of... if it happened.  

When we had to show what my father did to us... regular people with no resources, we had regular camera snapped photos, police reports, damaged property.  It was easily proven.  This case was great because it explained what we DO need to show abuse proof wise.  Also... to prove ACTUAL malice NOT EASY!!!  Why is it that everyone who defends Amber turns a blind eye to ALL that seems wrong with her case, like when you yell at your dog covered in couch fluff on a ripped couch like ""who did this??"" And they play dumb & look innocent like they aren't covered in mess.  This not about bias, its about truth, about honesty, about seeing facts to back up your story.

Has anyone ever wondered if Weinsttein was getting nasty messages and being subjected to systematic hate? And this was before the verdict came down? I don't recall anything like that.

The world needed MeToo, no one wants a return to the ""old ways"". And the Depp vs Amber case doesn't in itself mean the ""end"" of MeToo. The reaction of some of the public, especially some women's rights advocates, may destroy MeToo. Because it shows that no one cares about justice, only about hating men.

The journalist interviewed during the report demonstrates the problem. Even though it turns out that Depp was at least partly a victim of domestic violence and that we have condemned him prematurely, she still fails to put herself in his position at all. 

Her interview makes it sound like something ""bad"" happened, something that sets a dangerous precedent for opening other cases. It doesn't occur to her that there was a mistake and that he was wrongly convicted. 

The battle against sexual and domestic violence is not about one gender winning and the other losing. It should be in the interest of all of us. But the case has shown that it is not. At least in the reporting, it gives the impression that no one cares about Depp - empathy is being shown to Amber even though she lost. 

If that's what the MeToo movement has been about all along - getting every woman the ability to accuse a man and automatically destroying him with no defence, then yes, it's time for it to end and for a fairer alternative to come along that thinks of all victims, not just some.",1,2022-06-06T01:51:18Z,2022-06-06T01:51:18Z

@Chris-tc8sm,"I disagree with Martha Gill. 

 For all of us who watched the trial it was very obvious that Amber Heard is a liar.

And when she was caught out lying about donating the money she got from Johnny in their divorce and was confronted about it she refused to concede.
 Instead she played word games ""I pledged the money"" she kept saying, like pledging and donating are actually the same thing.

A typical psychopath. Never admit the truth even when caught red handed.

If indeed Mr Depp was found guilty of abuse by the previous uk trial then it means only one thing that they fell for her lies and bad acting.

Im sure we're going to speak lot of the narcissistic and psychopathic individuals saying things like Martha Gill is saying to try and save one of their own.

But all of us who saw the court case and saw Amber on the stand won't be gaslighted she is a malicious, abusive, toxic person.

And what about her lying under oath? I believe it was proved that she also lied under oath during the uk trial.

she gets away with it Scott free? Is that the law. No penalty for lying under oath?",0,2022-06-05T21:45:29Z,2022-06-05T21:45:29Z

@bradslowgrove1128,"This is a shallow cop out about the U.K case by this woman because Heard told the U.K. judge and he accepted that she had donated the money to the LA Children's Hospital and ACLU as she pledged when she had not and the judge was prejudiced against  Depp's substance abuse. Where in America a Virginia jury just thinks that is par for the course for Hollywood and the environment in which movie stars operate. Further Depp's lawyers in the Virginia case were much more thorough in bringing out what Heard is really like and what some women can really be capable of in real life. It was clear Heard was not an abuse victim at the hands of Depp and had borderline personality disorder on more than just strong believable expert testimony. This personality disorder is also consistent with the bed defecation and supported by all the additional surrounding circumstances as to its discovery and the timing of that discovery all pointing to Heard as the culprit and meeting the civil standard of proof. Depp made a wise move and was lucky to send someone to the residence first before he was to arrive to pick up his things otherwise there may have been proof difficulties as to who was responsible. Heard would have not known that she would be sued in America at that time and would have believed she was untouchable on this issue with only Depp to allege otherwise. Heard could not have anticipated an independent witness making the discovery and warning Depp not to come despite the residence being empty. Note that the bed defecation aspect is so awkward and disgusting I suspect it was not in the U.K proceedings and even the media runs away from it and they usually have no limits in ignoring discretion on anything but this was so off it would not increase audience market share. It took the law to bring out the truth. Still it is perfectly consistent with the expert psychiatric diagnosis that is also independently corroborated by Heard's texts to Depp that shows Heard has chronic but delusional abandonment issues which is common to borderline personality disorder people. It is no coincidence that the bed defecation occurred at a time when Heard finally accepted the marriage was over and Depp had permanently ""abandoned"" her. A response from Heard had to mark this final occasion commensurate with her perception of the magnitude of Depp's final ""abandonment"". To Heard it was what the occasion called for. and a defecation message was more personally distinctive than her ""abandonment"" text messages to the escaping Depp. She marked her territory as being in Depp's bed no different than a rhino. It all fits Heard's psychiatric condition like a glove. Her lack of shame about this behaviour is also consistent with this personality disorder and her claim it was the dog is as ridiculous in all the circumstances as the dog eating her homework. All personality disorder people are evil beyond ordinary experience and not like usual "" bad"" , unreliable, dishonest and untrustworthy people  but have perverse goals that only mean something delusional and subjective to them. This makes them hard to identify and to discover as their motives are not the same as other bad people.They know they are mad and good at covering it up. I suspect there are other strange off things Heard did to Depp that he does not know about when he was alone, unconscious and in a vulnerable state, passed out from too much alcohol and/or other substances. I am suspicious that Heard took a picture of Depp that happens to show an ice cream spill on his trousers when Depp was comatose and just happens to strike a pose in an exact humiliating cameo that bears an inference to the disgusting hallmarks of her defecation farewell message. Heard has too many configuration coincidences that infer there is an active human mind behind these perverse events. I suspect where the ice cream spill was located was strategically chosen by Heard much like the bed defecation was but to be fair she was not cross examined on this and I am relying on how this photograph looked to me through a television screen. The bed defecation was only slightly transgressed in evidence as if it spoke for itself but what it had to say to Depp was not further explored in the evidence. The ice cream spill had more subtlety with some plausible deniability to boot. Given as a lawyer I did psychiatric cases for decades I wonder what else did Heard NOT take photos of when she was alone with Depp  asleep from drink etc. and helpless? Did Heard engage in perverse humiliating power pantomimes over the unconscious, vulnerable Depp? Personality disorder people are not like the rest of us. Only when you discover and experience one will people believe that such people walk among us as they are assisted in keeping their infirmity under wraps by the difficulty of explaining them to  the uninitiated and unbitten.
 I am afraid to say that the American justice system topped the British justice system on this one and that must stick in the English craw. Chalk this one up to the Yanks and Depp's American lawyers for a just result. I note Heard's post verdict statements are  just a continuation of the intelligence insulting nonsense she preached from the stand. I cannot see Heard having any viable grounds of appeal other than to mount some unguided missile attack on the compensation head of the damages verdict as excessive. Appellate courts usually do not like to encourage assessment cases as they can choke up appellate court lists and generous juries are not often errors of law. Depp owned his true bad behavior but Heard owned none of hers and continued to falsely defame Depp and tried to attach herself to the cause of genuinely abused female domestic violence victims. Again no shame. Her abuse was as a child long ago, before she met Depp who has been a consequent innocent victim of Heard's child abuse and its causally irreversible personality disorder.This has sadly stopped Heard developing a proper identity structure. That is her abuse but it has nothing to do with Depp and unfortunately has created a personality that no one in the current circumstances can feel sorry for.",0,2022-06-05T20:26:44Z,2022-06-05T20:26:44Z

@KimA67.,"In my opinion ... To clarify not FANDUM but FACTDUM. The world watched and heard all the evidence and due to that EVIDENCE, Amber clearly showed what a vandictive x-wife, who lied repeadly to frame her spouse did  calculated events and did cut his finger off by throwing a bottle at him. Of course if the audio could be played she would be GUILTY in the UK for up to 10 years due to their Glass law. So she lied there too. But maybe that can be revisited legally? More interesting is that so many MSM will give the ABUSER, Amber Heard who was found GUILTY across the board, 15 minutes of fame, and the VICTOM Johnny Depp not so much. I guess you folks did not have time to actually look into the evidence as opposed to just getting out an interview. Amber set him up with on alot of fronts especially her video of Depp slamming cupboards. Well, if your mother passed, you've lost MILLIONS the night before, I'm sure many people would be slamming cupboards. You didnt play part in this video of Amber smurking and finding it funny. She looked like a PREDATOR not a victom. You see the World watched in awe, based on EVIDENCE of a VICTOM and wanting JUSTICE for this man. Had it been a woman, the support would have been there too. Gender is not the ISSUE. At 65, I didnt realize fully the lengths the media would go in TWISTING TRUTHS .... but I am now and shame on those that INSULT especially THE COURT SYSTEM - there should be a CHARGE for that one, JUSTIFY BRUTALITY of an ABUSER, and a trial in the UK. Which by the way should have been thrown out. The judge in the British case is best mates with the owner of the paper and his wife is good mates with Heard so he shouldn't have been the judge for the case in the first place. Oh yes Amber had dinner with them how convient. Sorry you on the wrong side of TRUTH and REALITY. You would actually have more viewers if you shared the ABSOLUTE TRUTH in its ENTIRETY.  Martha Gill, yes it is a straight forward case. Amber lied and a MOUNTAIN of EVIDENCE PROVED this, she LOST PERIOD. She should be heartbroken she has shamed herself.

@paulpiper9696,"The BBC and UK media have a skewed presentation of the case and the facts and seems to be an agenda to support the Sun, the UK legal system and the erroneous  decision by a judge (who by all accounts is close friends with Rupert Murdoch).

Compare it with most of the Australian and American media there's a neutral factual reporting of this case that a person, who  has made appalling false allegations against her ex-husband, has lost the court case.

It's not 15 million. Again incompetence in reporting. JD is effectively been awarded 8.35 million after he pays Amber her 2 million.

The evidence that shows manipulated and edited photos that even then doesn't correlate to her version of events on the assalts. The fact photos were taken at the exact same time and when asked why they look different she states that a light was turned on.

The fact she clearly alerted media outlets and released videos and photos to the media and denied doing so.

The fact she says, "" I could never hurt Jonny' and there are recordings  and photographic evidence that says she hit him repeatedly and even in the court she admits she hit him on more than one occasion. 

Evidence she puts forward is not only rebutted but independent witnesses step forward and say that they never saw it or that she's lying. 

She lied about donating money to charities. 

Her whole image is based on a lie. She has a hortiry of domestic violence against make and female partners and still the BBC take this stance that she's the victim.",1,2022-06-04T13:37:40Z,2022-06-04T13:37:40Z

@makila7715,"Shame on you BBC! The evidence clearly showed that Amber Heard not only meticulously prepared her onslaught but also ruthlessly exploited and triggered Johnny Depp during and after their relationship. One doesn't have to be a Depp fan to have found her histrionic testimony almost unbearable to watch and conclude she was fabricating and embellishing her story as she was delivering it. Her legal team produced second-rate witnesses with questionable testimony. Depp's sometimes halting delivery was also difficult to watch as he carefully chose his words in an attempt to avoid adding insult to injury. He is to be commended for his composure throughout when so much was at stake. I think the boulevard rag owes him an apology. Emerging victoriously from a trial by jury carries more weight than a scandal-mongering newspaper justifying its right to defame  Far from harming the #Metoo movement, Amber Heard has unwittingly rebalanced a platform  on which some gold diggers and attention seekers have destroyed men's lives. How many real victims have the means and luxury to document years of domestic abuse and suffering before cracking, reporting and leaving a relationship? -  celebrities do ! On the contrary, this travesty will inspire more scrutiny of accusers and credibility of victims in future domestic abuse investigations.In my estimation, she is en entitled, deranged  woman, who banked on her looks and rose to fame and fortune by association, In the process she wrecked relationships and got away with character assassination.However, amidst the sex/drugs/rock' n roll fabrications in her tawdry expose of the intimate workings of their relationship, she merely exposed her own failings and guilt. Johnny Depp had to resort to banging cabinet doors and hiding away in order  to deal with her taunting and humiliations. This video with amplified sound is being paraded by both mainstream and social media by those flying under a false flag in an attempt to muck up a unanimous verdict in favour of Mr Depp. Spouting lies under oath is not to be confused  with freedom of speech.",3,2022-06-04T09:56:03Z,2022-06-04T09:56:03Z

@MrAvalon20,"Predictable BBC bias, although unsurprising. 
 Heard's version of events, changed like the colour of a chameleon's skin. To quote Camille Vasquez, ""Heard's version of events is a moving target"". During the trial, she was also proven, to have repeatedly, to have lied. 

Her attorneys even submitted the same photo twice and Heard gave testimony that it supported events on 2 totally different dates. When questioned later about the double submission, her memory got suitably hazy, and she stated that if the metadata hadn't been redacted, she could give an answer. Her own lawyers had redacted the metadata!

Photo's presented as evidence, by ""team Amber"", had been edited. An expert witness testified to this, although to be honest, anyone with common sense could conclude the same, in at least one particular case. A photo which had had the colour saturation drastically turned up, was contrasted with an exact same shot, but which had normal saturation. The doctored one, made her look like she had a sore below her eye. There was exact same timestamp on both photogrpahs, down to the second.

At one point, Heard's attorney Elaine Bredehoft, showed off a Milani makeup case, explaining it was the exact one used by Amber, to cover up bruises. The company responded by releasing a TikTok video, explaining that the product came out a year after she filed the divorce papers! 

Heard originally claimed that abuse from Johnny started in 2012. She later claimed it started in 2013, after Johnny's attorney, presented a large hunting knife to the jury, and pointed out that Heard had given it to him, for his birthday in 2012. Prompting the question, why would she choose such  a gift for a violent man, whom she was supposedly afraid of?

On the stand and in deposition, she repeatedly claimed she had donated the $7 million, in divorce payout to charity, which was a lie. She purgered herself in the UK courts, making this very claim. Trying to get the truth out of her was like pulling teeth. She eventually admitted that she hadn't actually paid the money at all. 

She made the mistake of trying to make the jury think Johnny had pushed Kate Moss down dome stairs. By mentioning Kate's name, it opened the door to Johnny's team, being able to call her as a witness. Kate Moss confirmed the claim was nonsense.

Depp's team showed how Heard had arranged for TMZ to turn up when she filed for an injunction, with a mark on her face. They were even instructed where to be, to get a shot of a ""bruise"". Depp had left to go on tour 6 days earlier. However, the next day she was photographed and reported by a newspaper, looking fresh faced, smiling and without a bruise to be seen. This was submitted as evidence.

Heard tried to claim that Johnny completely trashed a trailer that they stayed in, in a fit of rage. The owner testified, saying he had to charge $62 for a light sconce which accidentally got damaged. He also testified to Amber shouting at, and berating Johnny as they left a gathering. 

There's more, but it's a bank holiday and I have better stuff to do, than do the BBC's job for them.",1,2022-06-04T08:51:38Z,2022-06-04T09:13:16Z

My personal understanding from all this evidence and testimony and edited photos etc is that Amber is a troubled soul, she’s had it rough that is obvious, she’s not well and would likely do well to seek professional help. She gets angry for reasons she probably doesn’t quite understand herself , and she gets physical and violent if it spirals away. Johnny, has had it rough, he takes a lot of drugs to deal with his pains, he probably understood part of Ambers pains even if they express themselves differently, and they both tried to help each other with their different daemons. It got ugly , but Amber lied about so much on the stand , that was obvious to me, the behavior experts could explain in detail why she seemed so off. Her own recordings revealed a much different Amber, and no where was there signs of any Abuse from Johnny, other shit for sure, those two should never have put rings on, but no abuse from Johnny was proven, and there was no MeToo, none of Johnnys past long time partners have called out MeToo, on the contrary, All of them has had nothing but good words to say about him. 
There was abuse from Amber however. 

So please , if there has been a set back, it’s because a women has now been deemed by a court of law to have attempted to lie about having been abused  , and beyond that , acted abusive herself. That only shows that people lie , in this case in all likelihood in part due to serious mental disorders. 

So maybe this shows a need for a balance. 
When someone speaks out about abuse , take them seriously, but remember that alleged abuse is a serious matter for the accused as well. Take it all seriously, and don’t jump to conclusions until everyone has been thoroughly heard. That’s my take on all of this",0,2022-06-04T03:22:20Z,2022-06-04T03:22:20Z

@mystiekstargazer3735,"The arrogance of MSM and especially the @BBCNews; totally biased!
We, the people were grateful to see the evidence and not the regurgitated version of information that you, and other MSM, have been shoving down our throats for years.
AT LEAST IN THE USA - JD got a fair trial where all (original and verified) information was brought into court and that differs with the UK trial between JD and “the Sun”

In the UK the judge Andrew Nicol that presided over the trial was the father of an employee of the SUN; his son’s name Robert Palmer. He was therefore biased and should have never taken JD’s case!

Now look at the evidence:
1 The video was an indication of her trying to get a rise out of him; she sold them to TNZ as soon as she could to give him negative publicity.
2 The photos were photoshopped and therefore most of “HER” evidence was not submissible as court evidence (she didn’t have the origineel pictures anymore—an innocent person does not destroy evidence)
3 We, the people, heard HER hysterical voice on the tapes; we saw the pictures of her physical abuse towards JD (original copies I may add). To top everything, she also amputated his fingertip for which he had to be hospitalized.  
4 People were also angry about her so-called defence of women. Many women that have been victims of DV have also seen, in her body language, their former abusers. She is no spokeswoman for them and the #MeToo movement has and is being criticized by men but mostly by women.

Actually TMZ was told to go to the courthouse and make sure when she turned her head to take a picture, the video of Johnny slamming the cabinets.. that was taken by Amber. And  then TMZ got that video and the copyright. A tmz former employee said they got the copyright within 15 minutes which means it came from the source ,, Amber sent it to them. Then there’s bruise one day and it disappeared the following day .. none of the people who saw her in multiple occasion saw bruises . she defecated on their bed.. all the photos of events showed her with flawless skin. She said makeup. But she said he punched her repeatedly on the face with churnky rings on his fingers she thought her nose was broken. She didn’t have any medical records to present only flawless pictures, if your nose was broken and you have split lip your face would be swollen but .. nope. The psychologist of JD said Amber has borderline and histrionic personality disorder which match the way she behaves in court . While her 
Psychologist says she’s normal except for trauma from Johnny depp which was odd because she never saw Johnny depp for consultation, she just basically believe Amber,  Amber lied on the stand many many times and it was caught when they interview the other people eg. Kate Moss or that manager who said he was not upset at all it was only $60 damage which they charge Johnny Depp, But Amber said he was furious because the entire place was trashed. Amber said the dog defacated not her, but a body guard said she told him it was a prank. She said she donated the 7 million  to charities but the charities said she didn’t they did get money from Johnny Depp and Elon Musk, .. these are just few things she lied about. All the police officers who went to the house didn’t see any house damage or any injury to her face and she said they thought it wasn’t injury.like what?

@russellbrown1036,"The Heard counter claim wasn't just about if it was ""A Hoax"", it had other complex details that the jury said were not consistent with the facts. BBC, your explanation is intelligentially dishonest, it was a consistent verdict. Depp proved 2 out of the three statements his lawyer said were pretty much true, which mentioned that her story was a ""hoax"".

She had the same photo with a slightly different contrast, and she said on the stand said ""those are different photos"". She did fake evidence, it was proved with exit metadata. That's just one lie she was caught in, another one being that she never paid all the charity money. 

She admitted on tape to hitting him. She admitted that. It's her own words.

The title of the article said ""sexual violence"" and because she knew she was now liable for that, all of a sudden she said Depp raped her. She also sat down with the people that wrote the article and made sure everyone knew it was about Depp. She also admitted on the stand that is why she wrote the article. She wanted ""more impact"" by tying it to Depp. That proves she acted with actual malice. 

Also, she didn't write the title, but according to the law, if you claim you have written it, you've published it. Which makes complete sense.

The case with the sun, the judge knew Amber Heard's team. Conflict of interest. That's why Depp wanted it on TV this time.

Also you said Depp claimed he lost jobs, he did, he lost harry potter and I am sure a lot of other films. Hard fact.

She admitted to hitting Depp. At the very least, it's mutual abuse.

Has absolutely nothing to do with the metoo moment, just one man trying to clear his name. Nobody knows what happened, but Heard's case was full of holes. It is what it is. You have to go on a case by case basis.",0,2022-06-03T08:44:20Z,2022-06-03T09:37:07Z

Victims of domestic violence seeing this case will see that the true victim has indeed been found to be a victim and thus will more likely come forward as is has been shown that domestic abusers do get found guilty, like in Heard's case.

edit: She mentions rape, but I don't remember any rape allegations in the trial, so it leads me to believe that this Martha woman is a toxic lying prick who hates men.

Generally one opens the floodgate and are joined by others saying, Me Too. Just think back to other figures acused and the amount of victims that stood behind the first victim to support them telling the world, this happened to Me Too. 
If anything this should give men the chance to come forward and say, Johnny Depp was abused by his partner, Me Too. Abuse is not exclusively male to female. Amber Heard came forward against Johnny and the world was silent, no one stood up for her to say Me Too, he hurt me too. However, she has 2 partners against her including an arrest, Johnny has had his Me Too. 
Anyone and everyone that is a victim of abuse whatever it may be or whatever gender they or their partners may be has a right to their Me Too.

@Stardust201208,"Why does the BBC show the video of Johnny shutting cabinet doors, but doesn’t play the audio of Amber ADMITTING she hit him? 
In the U.S. we don’t discourage you from telling the TRUTH. We discourage from telling LIES and DEFAMING someone like Amber did. The first amendment protects your right to free speech, but doesn’t protect you from speaking of someone in a defamatory manner (think screaming fire in a theater room). If you are telling THE truth not YOUR truth, you will be believed. Also, he didn’t win $15 million, he was awarded $15,350,00 because the LAW in Virginia caps compensatory verdicts to $3.5k. Seriously disappointed in the BBC supporting an abuser (Amber) and not the victim. Yes, they were both toxic to each other. This also had nothing to do with me too either. It has to do with telling the truth. There is no anxiety of me too.

She probably thought that was the safety net against ever having to corroborate her claims, Johnny being too shamed and scared that the world will see his flaws. But she harmed him and his name enough that he probably thought “Well I’ve got nothing to lose; let's do this. You have more to be exposed than me.”

“That’s why I wrote the op-ed.” Amber wasted a lot of the court's time trying to dismiss the case because she denied writing the op-ed. If this wasn’t televised the world would never get to witness all the evil that is Amber Heard.

Amber: Tell them, Johnny Boi. Tell them and see who sides with you...

@HollowApollo1,"Generally I like BBC, but it is very clear that BBC is only showing Heard's side of the trial here.

Why not also play one of the recordings of Heard aggresively taunting Depp in a very abusive way, or admitting to hitting Depp while speaking to him in a condescending tone, or Heard taunting Depp while telling him no one will ever believe he is being abused?

Instead, you show the video of Depp slamming cabinets (like Depp cant also be imperfect) while conveniently leaving out the part when Heard grins into the camera.

It is also condescending for BBC to imply that we are blinded by stardom or tricked by power. 

Heard was caught in lies. She failed to present evidence. She was directly contradicted by other witnesses...and many said she would chase depp when he tried to escape altercations. She documented all sorts of things,  yet had no documention of alleged injuries like being hit in the head by a grown man wearing rings. Do you know the damage that would do?

@moshin70,"Typical BBC biased garbage, along with a lefty Observer columnist talking crap - ""Efforts to humiliate Amber Heard"", what a load of bull, Amber humiliated herself by being a bad and inconsistent liar.  Why is this columnist trying to defend the indefensible?  If she respected the truth, law and justice, instead of pity and emotional bias she’d speak for Johnny Depp – but no, she’s more concerned about “Me Too” and defending a blatant liar and not the reality and verdict of a fair case.  Any celebrity on social media knows the repercussions for what they put out there (good or bad) - it goes with Social Media territory.  The public aren’t stupid, they can see between truth and lies and a credible witness, Amber’s testimony was inconsistent throughout the trial – to the point of perjuring herself.  If you view this with cold hard logic and reality, not one celeb against another, this case is about an insecure, unpleasant, emotional needy human fabricating stories about another, who manipulated evidence, disagreed with her previous testimonies and statements when pressed under cross examination.  Amber used social media movements and the press to try and exonerate herself, to appear a blameless victim, holier than thou – and let’s not forget the 7 million she promised to give to charity.  These lefties must get their heads out of their butts and view things in the cold light of day, without emotional bias, the law doesn’t care about emotions, the law and courts are interested in truth and justice and not someone’s feelings and lies.  This verdict is a good day for both men and women, men shouldn’t be afraid to come forward – the law is there to listen and represent both sexes and cases, just don’t follow Amber Heard’s example, you’ll get slaughtered in court.",1,2022-06-02T18:09:51Z,2022-06-02T18:10:44Z

@ianleary5780,"This was never about Depp and Heard. This was a much bigger societal-level contest. Many have asked why so many men have been so committed--vitriolic, even-- in their online support for Depp. The answer is simple: Depp is fighting for their lives. Men in the English-speaking world believe the courts are stacked against them. Men in the English-speaking world believe that women get everything in a divorce, that women are always believed when they accuse a man of anything, and that the ""justice"" system delivers anything but for men. Whether this perception matches reality doesn't matter from the standpoint of understanding why men have been so in Depp's corner. In the minds of many, many men, if Heard can get away with victimizing Depp with the court's permission, no man will ever be safe from women again. Melodramatic? Yes. But no less real in the minds of many men for the melodrama. 
Heard shouldn't have been targeted for death threats. On the other hand, she chose to go to the court of public opinion long before she and Depp ended up in court. The court of public opinion is complex, capricious, and cruel.",0,2022-06-02T18:03:35Z,2022-06-02T18:03:35Z

@PierreChe,"What is truly fascinating to me, is that in general, media channels have the incredible power to present events that most people do not experience. They tell you about something you have not had the chance to observe for yourself, and so as an audience, you have very little ways to know what is right or not. You either trust it or you don't. But really, you don't know. But here, the whole world was able to tune in to the whole process. This is an event you could experience first hand if you wanted to. And many people did. I did. The whole thing (i know, get a life right ^^). It is so revolting to realize the absolute bias and total dissonance of mainstream media. Not based on opinion, wild guesses or theories. Nah, you observe a process happening. it is obvious what is happening to anyone that would follow said process. And then you've got journalists that have seen only snippets of it explaining to you with total confidence that what everyone could see watching didn't happen. To the journalists presenting this piece, especially the gentleman ""summarizing"" the trial, please, find some ethic in your work, actually go back and watch the whole process, change how you work or just get a job as salesmen and saleswomen.

If there was even a slightest hint that Johnny may have beaten Amber, the defamation accusation wouldn't sustain at all. The verdict is calling Amber Heard a liar beyond doubt.

The Sun won the UK case mainly based on Amber's testimony and dismissed all evidence from Johnny's side. But all evidence provided by Amber are proven sketchy at best in the US trial. It was so obvious she was lying if you watch the whole thing.

I don't know why some media are trying to spin this as a lost for abused woman. This case is not about that. Amber was the abuser, not the victim. This case is about an abused man who was defamed by a liar, who happened to be a woman, trying to clear his name.",0,2022-06-02T15:07:06Z,2022-06-02T15:07:06Z

@Nazareeni,"Look's like Amber's dog stepped on the BBC.

BBC, I just watched your other woeful coverage on the trial's outcome on TV, and I have to say, I've never seen you lot try to protect a villain this much since Jimmy Savile.

On that television report, I noticed:
- No mention how she edited her photos.
- You tried to make out the photos were ""evidence"" vs. Johnny's ""public opinion"", whilst not even showing Johnny's severed finger.
- No mention of Heard's past victims
- No mention of Johnny's overwhelming testimonies from witnesses, including those who don't even know Johnny Depp but already know how much of a dangerous sociopath Amber Heard is. 
- No mention about the tapes in which you can clearly hear her bullying him. They aren't short recordings, either.
- No mention of how credible experts have all testified against Heard, from diagnosing her with histrionic personality disorder to catching her out in tampering with photos.
- No mention how her scarce amount of ""experts"" where mainly nutjobs that got stumped during their cross examinations.
- This one's a shocker: No mention of her committing perjury, from start to finish of this trial. At many points she even contradicted herself! 

She even went as far as to play dumb with the most obvious things. For instance, she sat there and pretended she didn't know what TMZ is. This was right after being shown a video of herself in her 2016 deposition letting slip that she shared a video to TMZ and reacting badly to her own slip up (the video in question was the cabinet slamming video - the same video which I just watched you, BBC, play to the public with zero context about Depp's mother's death, funeral, and Amber baiting him at his lowest point). So she feigned ignorance regarding TMZ, whilst turning her head to the jury to tell that blatant lie. She went on and did it again.

She turned her head to the jury to tell a lie every...single...time. Imagine watching bullsh*t like that, and repeat it for the entire trial. That is why she lost the trial. Not because of internet popularity. Her lawyers looked like they did such a bad job because she couldn't even keep her stories straight with them, either. Before the trial, Heard's lawyers successfully fought tooth and nail to block Depp's ex's from testifying, all for it to be undone the moment Heard lied on the stand by bringing up Kate Moss, thus forcing Moss into the conversation. Unsurprisingly, Moss was not on Heard' side.

BBC, you should be ashamed of yourselves. I don't know if you're trying to protect the Sun (hah!), you're peddling an agenda, maybe you've been tipped off, or you have editors that Jack off over Heard in their free time, or perhaps your chiefs are just brain-damagingly gullible, but either way you clearly haven't done enough research on this case and someone needs sacking. You even mock the whole process by bringing on a domestic abuse group to criticise the outcome of this trial, when the consensus by domestic abuse survivors appears to be one of absolute hatred for Amber, since her lies completely belittle domestic abuse victims. Sort your sh*t out. Seriously.

- Ooh, I have one more: Absolutely no mention of her taking a huge deuce on Johnny's bed.",2,2022-06-02T14:31:52Z,2022-06-02T14:31:52Z

@byankaree91,Shame on the BBC for the way in which they are framing this! Johnny lost the UK trial because Amber Heard was not a PARTY! Meaning all that was required of the Sun to do is prove the accusations came from THE SOURCE i.e. Amber Heard. Whether they were right or wrong was irrelevant. Hence why he lost to THE SUN and not AMBER HEARD as they were entitled to free press,2,2022-06-02T13:37:43Z,2022-06-02T13:39:03Z
@KayC18,"Majority of the mass media try hard to water down this verdict, specially UK tabloids, they have to do damage control, cause they prioritized politic above justice, one judge to decide Johnny case in uk while his son work for “the suns” that Johnny try to sue, they have been covering up since then, divide and conquer is far more important than justice in uk, luckily the whole case been broadcasted, so the public knows what actually happen, uk been pushing “believe women even it’s a lie” not believe in all humans that suffer DV, it’s time for men and women come together by not being brainwash by the mass media to divide us, there are bad women or men out there, there were also good on both side, look through all the headlines then u will realize how sad that most mass media were a tools for political party, main reason most of them delay the news is to reconstruct how to report it without hurting the main propaganda, specially in the uk as it was a shame, more will come… just watch how every single mass media emphasize amber being rape, ignored all the lies, Johnny Depp not showing up for verdict working in concert performing, partying and how a big setback for “women”. So #metoo movement can continue, I personally support anyone regardless of their gender, race or age to leave their DV partners and step forward, but heavily criticized lies, deception and manipulation….

@tanyabradley5414,"So where are the recordings that show how vile Amber Heard was towards Johnny Depp? Where she laughed like a maniac at him, goaded him, verbally abused him and admitted to hitting him? The video they chose to show was set up by AH on the day his mother died …. and it still doesn’t show him being violent towards her. He walks away at the end of it. Such bias. It’s an insult to our intelligence that they are still trying to suggest that Johnny was an abuser. There is a reason why most people were watching the trial on social media and not main stream media. We saw it as it was. Main stream media is trying to manipulate our way of thinking but they are just making themselves look stupid.

I went into this with an open mind. I only had to listen to one tape to know Amber Heard was full of sh*te. She claims to be scared of Johnny Depp, well she wouldn’t be speaking to him like that if she was. She claims he abused her throughout their relationship yet the ONLY photo she had is one of a red puffy face that, as it happens, had been manipulated by a photo editor!! She jumped when he went near her in court! C’mon, a child could have been more convincing than she was …. and she’s an actress! This was also the same woman that after taking out a TRO visited him at a hotel room and begged him to hug her and look at her and tried ripping his sunglasses of his face. That doesn’t sound like someone who is scared of him. On the contrary, it sounds like someone who feels she could still manipulate him and make things go her way. You don’t need half a brain cell to know who the abuser was in this relationship. 

Amber used and abused the Me Too movement (pretty much her MO) ….. but with the slogan “Believe All Women” it was always going to run into trouble. It was helping to create  a problem instead of helping a cause.

The world (without the help of mainstream media) saw through her lies. Justice has been done. No “if’s”, no “but’s”. End of!

But the way this video is edited makes it look like 'she's been mistreated.'
And from my understanding, the Depp V Sun proved nothing about abuse allegations, it only dealt with the reputational damages. It's been widely considered that the UK case was a miscarriage of justice.
As for Me2, shouldn't this be a win? An abuse victim that just 2 years ago would have been laughed out of the court room won. That's impressive isn't it?

@Talk4UK,"I am amazed of how wrong this piece of ""journalism"" from a ""reputable"" TV channel like the BBC is. Johnny Depp had the support of the world, not only of his fans. Not because he was a star only, not because he is rich, but because he was a victim and a survivor. Most of his supporters didn't support him with blind eyes. Many people didn't arrive at this trial with a formed opinion. People listened to both parts, and watched the trial and social media. If you listen to the lady from the Guardian you would need an extra bucket to throw up, due to the fact that she shouldn't even be called a journalist - what an embarrassment to the profession! What an insult to people's intelligence! Amber Heard was not a victim she was an abuser. She is a pathologic liar, an abuser and a manipulator and she didn't hesitate to destroy Johnny Depp's live and professional career and also impact those around him. Women and Men are people. Women don't speak the truth because they are women, Men don't lie because they are men. Assuming that is both stupid, ignorant, out of touch with reality and biased. A survivor of abuse is a survivor of abuse, man or woman. And that is why Johnny had the support of many a victim, both men and women. It is not alright to lie, it is not alright to fabricate abuse stories, it is not alright to manipulate people. The only ""anxiety"" that exists is of the liars and manipulators, that side themselves with real victims and ""Me Too"" movements for their own twisted purposed. The ""Me Too"" movement will only came stronger out of this, because now ""Imperfect victims"" = liars like Amber Heard got the message from the survivors, from the world and from the Judicial System that there are consequences when you lie.

There are numerous reasons why Depp lost the UK case, including large amounts of evidence not considered and outright lies from Amber and her sister that have now been proven to be untrue.

I don’t know how much power the court has to force her to pay Johnny his winnings but it’s a civil case not criminal tho she should be done for perjury from what I read she’s worth about $2m so where’s she gonna get $8.35m from?

@AlexDeLarge77,"Martha Gill an Observer columnist is evidently a feminist. She seems to be stumbling over her words at the beginning, like she trying to get her narrative straight.

If there was, as she claims, a backlash against MeToo; which was embodied by the amount of “social media traffic” then it was a backlash predominantly perpetrated by women. She should do well to reflect on that fact. I have read hundreds if not thousands of “comments” over the duration of this trial, and the vast majority where posted by women. I can’t remember reading a single one in support of Ms Heard. 

I think Martha Gill should think very long and hard about that.

She seems to have her wires crossed on this matter. If it’s the MeToo movement that Martha is so concerned about (which is strange way of evaluating this case) and that the “backlash” has set the movement back. To that I say; No. It was Ms Heard who set MeToo back by her behaviour. By her deceitful, spiteful and vengeful behaviour.

The Jury were not privy to that “social media traffic” but could see what everyone watching could see. That Amber Heard is a lier and an abusive, manipulative person with (as Dr Curry pointed out) a borderline personality disorder. In short she’s an utter disgrace. If Martha is “really” concerned with MeToo then she should hold Ms Heard to account.

I think at this point it’s axiomatic.",1,2022-06-02T11:05:05Z,2022-06-02T11:05:05Z

@kenhart1969,"I cannot say how pleased I am in the verdict. I sat an watched hours of live court streams (not other peoples versions) to get a clear unbiased view of the case.  Hearing the recordings and witnesses statements and photos I would say I would vote for Mr Depp on every count. The problem now is Tabloids and how they skew the outcome. I have seen multiple newspapers saying horrible things, for example ""Its an Orgy of Misogyny"" (The Guardian). There are plenty of others Im sure you can find. What I also find amazing is #MeToo, I have argued for them, I have waded in verbally and even lost a friend or two. But now? Reading all the statements about how bad it is and how its killing them ?  I'm wondering if they go beyond real cases and use it as a platform for publicity? To me ANYONE that has or is in an abusive relationship should be helped regardless of colour, age, sexuality. The fact that a person lost a law case and she was part of an organisation shows just how some abusers operate - hidden in plain view. IF anything, Ms Heard is directly responsible for the negative impact on such organisations. The best she can do is come clean and admit the faults and not try and lie more. This would be a great article and im sure that she could regain some of her credibility coming clean. How often do you read the side from an abuser, why and what makes them tick or trigger? I'm just hoping that all those who stood by Ms Heards lies now have the courage and realise the errors of their ways and make amends.

Maneuvering words to fit her own liking, to confuse the people and to give doubt to the juries. SHE WAS LYING UNDER OATH! my goodness! And here we have two women talk about the #metoo movement and the outcome of this case..blame amber heard for it! Many men have been brought down by the #metoo movement and yes they were truly guilty and also because of evidence. Here, evidence is falsified, pictures are edited and videos are made or cut short to cut out the snickering in the background. This is clearly entrapment! Amber said she had  broken nose? Busted lip? Back has been beaten and head pushed to the side of the bed where the bed wood cracked? Wow! if you don't know how things work then you would really believe it! Leaning your face on the side of a very hard wood where the wood cracked due to pressure would also result in the same on your skull or any part of your body!

@Infinitewill369,"Why they still support Amber Heard this way?

In the end fo the video they say that there's is possiblity that this will affect negatively to world. So they basically say that, because Johnny told the truth, this will affect negatively to world. And what they say was that there is possiblity that abusers start use courts as their advantage.

 And they still speak in a way that it's not fully clear is Johnny abuser or not, after many evidences, this is very strange to me. And they say that this will negatively affect to metoo movement, which is strange again that they focus on negative sides of this end result, because there's a lot more good than negative on this end result. 

Literally this showed the world that, yes we have freedom to speak, but that doesn't mean we can lie, about things and ruin other people reputations by false stories. And that men can be victim of DV too. And this brings awareness that there's this kind of narcissist people in there world like Amber, that try to ruin people lives, and this 6 weeks gave many people awareness about how narcissists act and try to manipulate and fool you. There's a lot good about this end result.

 I don't trust media. It tries to manipulate and brainwash people. In the beginning media did support Amber Heard, And they continued that even after there was evidence that Amber Heard was the abuser not Johnny Depp. 

And they still continue this? I have never trusted media and i will probably never will, unless there happens some big changes that media actually starts telling truth and help our world, and not try to manipulate and brainwash people.

@willygonutz9687,"The part of the case that Amber 'won', was against a quote/article that JD's LAWYER said/wrote.
Because Waldmen was considered a 'spokesperson' for JD, this made JD responsible for the comments, even though he didn't actually say them.
They got NOTHING on Johnny.
But that doesn't stop Team Turd claiming wins that aren't theirs.
After the decision AH said:
""Blah, blah, blah, blah, when WE  won the UK trail"".
AH had NO part in that trial... The Sun Newspaper won that.
And the 'win' today?
That was against one of  JD's old lawyers, not JD.
He just had to take the rap for something his lawyer said.
JD is stepping out of that courthouse smelling like roses and vindication.
Amber will slither back into whatever hole she crawled out of, and be back working the pipe and the pole before the end of the year..",0,2022-06-02T09:42:34Z,2022-06-02T09:42:34Z

@AdamsWorlds,"Ambers performance (and it was that) was terrible. She came across as so disingenuous it's unreal.  This case also being public to view has really shown how bad our court system in the UK is! Even the judges son here was mates with the journalist. How was that ever allowed in a UK court? Ambers statement was a spit in the face to innocent men and woman who have been wronged.   Trying to claim frees peach as a defence to cover up her lies was also disgusting. I don't normally wish people misfortune, but in this case i hope to never see her on the screen again, but that she can get her life back on track and come to terms with her lies. Oh and if the ""METO"" movement wishes to see all woman viewed as innocent  by default then its sexist and has no place in a modern society.",1,2022-06-02T09:38:58Z,2022-06-02T09:45:48Z
@BosskV2.0,The framing of the final interview is concerning. The notion that Johnny Depp may have been an abuser who continued to abuse Amber Heard through the courtroom process would seem heavily biased. Thats a reversal of the truth. Amber Heard has been proven to abuse Johnny Depp and it was Amber Heard who continued her abuse through the courtroom process. To reverse the truth like that would indicate a biased against men and in favour of women. That is potentially misandrist sexism.,0,2022-06-02T09:38:40Z,2022-06-02T09:39:28Z

@colman3411,"How can this awful woman at the end, from tge observer may I add, a newspaper giant in the UK similar to the sun who may be shaking in their boots at amber heards lies being shown to the world in a thorough and globally viewed trial. It amazes me that anyone can genuinely look at all the evidence and not agree with the jury. To compare a case and trial like the one we have just seen with the process followed in UK courts is shocking. Johnny depp had to prove that the sun newspaper knowingly told falsehoods at the time they called him a wife beater, even if it was a lie, if they thought it to be true because of fake photos, lies and edited videos then they didn't defame him. It in no way examined or proved what amber heard said was true, it is a much quicker less detailed process and it is not heard by or deliberated by a jury but rather the judge themselves. This result is categorical, he did not abuse amber heard, or at least there is no evidence for that rather there is mountains of evidence to show the opposite is true. The media drive me insane they just say what they want people to believe and have long since stopped reporting facts to the public. The process of a trial is an examination of the facts, and if we allow a journalist to go on television and still call Johnny depp an abuser then the entire justice system is under threat from the power of the people who report on it and that is something we as a public cannot allow to happen.",10,2022-06-02T08:34:23Z,2022-06-02T08:34:23Z

@darrensaquaticsworld,I cant believe this women was on here still insinuating that Amber Heard had Been abused after 6 weeks of evidence that would suggest the complete opposite. In fact Amber Heard admitted to hitting Depp. She mentioned the UK trial where the judge put a heavy weight on Depp being a drug user and Amber giving away the 7 million divorce funds to charity which we now know is still sitting in her bank account. I think the main damage that's going to be caused to the me to movement is going to be caused by people like this who refuse to except that there is a good chance that Amber Heard was lying and actually may have committed perjury in court.,1,2022-06-02T07:39:06Z,2022-06-02T07:39:06Z

@yiseongessafi5276,"I am gutted and shocked that you still trying to find the honey in all this woman bitterness. As a victim of emotional abuse from a manipulative and narcissistic individual It was Hell to watch all of her interventions !! but forced myself to do so to be able to get an unbiased view over a serious case beyond the defamation civil case of it. These were criminal past actions on display. Even putting the 50/50 possible accuracy of her claims to include fairness(because the myth says that the best angel fell out from heaven right?) and putting a 50/50 chance per se on the possible unknown dark side of JDepp AND!!! ONLY watching THE direct trial without listening to any siding in the media intervention of Law and Crime Network OR any other media based videos with opinions, well my fairness based conclusion went against this psycologicaly damaging woman!!she needs psycological help!!!  Really. And people like her innocent daughter is endangered by a monster that just had her pride wounded from the rest of the world. This child will suffer and slowly suffocate from love showering,  gaslighting ect.. !!! 
AND for the Metoo movement? NO TRUTH WILL EVER AGAIN TARNISH,  society has morphed into a more woke one so if we are justice seekers and the movement protects victims from abuse  they should be happy that people will start to closely listen and stop blindly believing someone just because they have the branding iron in hand.  Men can suffer too and the patriarchy society has disminished men too when it comes to the idea of who can be the weakest ( boys will be boys???  shameful! boys dont cry?  even more shameful!!)
How about a Woman deceiving Women!!!???  Lying and manipulating them in to taking her side because of the Sis'code???  This is why I am more angry are people like AHeard. She is the woman ( with ulterior motive and bad reasons)  that would in the past ( or even now)  accuse publicly another innocent woman of being a witch, just because. Have you ever realise that there are morewomen serial killers than we could even believe? Years ago,  I tought there were none! 
The powerful men that have been trialed and judged because of the Metoo movement had proof against them. They deserve punishment.  Here The alleged proofs had no substancial thruth to them,  and her witnesses were shaddy and trained.  

I will listen to any woman that comes to me and says she is the victim of sexual, psychological or emotional abuse and support them but never blindly, I WILL LISTEN FIRST!  and clic at any malicious and unfunded claim I hear from them.  That is what justice in the Metoo movement should be.  Love should not be blind. And the idea of abusers shoyld not be gendered! 
I deeply support women around the world and our rights are far from attaining justice but you should be able to call a liar a LIAR when you catch one in any side.
This trial was detailed enough and gave a fair extensive plateform for both to be judged and because the logical result overruled the UK's closed doors 'decision should not let UK's pride be so wounded that it would be impossible to admit error and acknowledge the truth.",1,2022-06-02T07:14:36Z,2022-06-02T07:43:47Z

And you as a media outlet have the oppurtunity to show at least some of the vast amount of further evidence against her story  that was not allowed in court - for what reasons we don't know ! But you decided to be biased and push a narrative that is unjust, unfair, even dangerous and a shame to every REAL victims of DV. I mean, you certainly would agree that women are human beings, wouldn't you? And as all human beings are capable of lying, so are women! This is NOT about some weird ""battle of the sexes"", and by pushing it in this direction, you actually broaden the gap that's already been slashed between men and women by some overly ambitious and untruthful activists...I think, even if Ms Heard would admit herself, that she did lie all the time, you would probavly still spin the narrative to ""she was certainly pressured to say this""...and all the while you are baffled by the fact that most people don't trust you anymore...just step on the path of unbiased truth and informing the public properly,  which you have left so long ago, and eventually people will turn to you again...but what purpose does some obvious propaganda outlet serve to anyone?

Men too can be abused and feel some women have become too ideological. Any movement that empowers its interests-groups at the detriment of others will fail. What this trial clearly showed was a man being abused and yes they had complicated relationships perhaps also enforcing the arguments that not only men or women should be listened to or believed.

She was quick to photograph him in various states of indignity yet the only thing we saw was a tiny bruise.  I bruise daily because I am prone to banging into things.  I even bruise if my knee is too tightly touching my computer desk!  She needs psychiatric help and he needs to have his career back along with a divorce from substances.

@Teejay-jg1gw,"The ""Me too"" movement was originally invented for women telling the truth, not women who set out to ruin men with lies. What may set the movement back is people like this woman speaking who despite proven evidence that AH was lying about the abuse she endured and has even admitted to being abusive herself on recordings, the woman still is referring to JD as an abuser when the bar was set way high than in the UK, so this is the verdict that really matters to him and to the world. The fact that ""Me Too"" seems to also ignore that ""Me Too"" can also apply to ""Men Too"" is what tells everyone that the movement is sexist and ignorant against men as victims of women too. Men absolutely also endure abuse and deserves to be believed too if they are telling the truth. Yet even with AH admitting abusing JD on recordings, the movement and other feminist organisations and alot of women STILL refuse to admit AH was an abuser and STILL support AH. I honestly think this is to save face because of shame for backing an abuser. They continue to say oh they both defamed each other when only one very insignificant count was found in her favor but all 3 counts in his on points that show she lied and he did not. Its as if the shame just wont let them see the truth of the fact that the woman lied and they shamed him for something he did not do. So if the ""Me Too"" movement does get dismantled or set back after this, it wont be because people did not believe AH or because of JD fans, it would be because even after the verdict, it seems that the movement does not appear to care if the woman saying ""Me Too"" is actually telling the truth, it seems to the public that the movement backs woman even if they are lying, simply because they are women and even if a woman admits to abusing the man.

It was proven that Amber heard has a history of abuse and that Johnny Depp through multiple relationships and to probably relationships and long term marriage did not.

In contrast, there was a jury in the Virginia case. The Jury heard extensive evidence over 6 weeks. Which would have been very difficult for Johnny to win if he was the abuser. Amber had very good lawyers, she had more than enough opportunities to show her evidence. Instead Amber chose to lie, contradict herself and accuse other witnesses of lying under oath. I saw so many people at the beginning of the trial in support of Amber, but as the trial progressed more and more of them realised what happened and moved towards Johnny.

7million not donated to charity from her divorce money which she said she had paid on a tv show. 
TMZ -she leaked out the video to TMZ and denied she leaked it out,... the TMZ guy was an an amazing witness!!
Pictures that were fabricated- evidence from Meta data guy 
Kate moss as a character witness
Hicksville manager witness


UK trial was different amber heard was the witness she could say anything and it would be her word against Depp for the Sun, the US one reveals what really happened.

It doesnt matter if your are man or woman. It's about your character. 

Amber Heard is bongers.  She even has a record of being the abuser herself.

And the outrage in social media was not because shes a woman or victim, it is because ppl felt that she was the real abuser und liar. And that was backed up by the evidence to a certain amount.

It was the feeling of injustice towards JD that fueled it. And you are still producing such a baised report?

For if you did, you would have found Amber Heard's descriptions of the alleged abuse against her questionable. She was not Johnny Depp's imperfect victim. Perhaps, she was someone else's victim at one point in her life, but she's not his abuse victim. With what evidence do you base your claim on? There was not an ounce of credible evidence to prove JD ever abused her. Not one! It was quite the opposite, actually. JD's team have proven multiple times that she was the one who physically abused him. They proved it with her own words. Shame on you for ignoring evidence! And you call yourself a journalist!

@cathyrivas6496,"I don't know how the UK courts found JD guilty of abuse. The evidence I saw in this trial in no way proves JD was an abuser. I have experienced abuse and a person doesn't suddenly become an abuser. A person will have a history of some kind of abuse even though it may be subtle at first and then increase over time. Witnesses proved this was not the case with JD. There was none of this in JD's case. Instead it showed that AH was deceptive, that the only injuries she ever claimed to have  or told anyone about were mild, tiny marks on her body that she could have gotten from bumping into something or made herself. She never ever told anyone or took photos of injuries she claimed were extensive ie. the bottle. I mean if you take photos of bruises and seek medical attention for minor injuries would you not do the same for major injuries? She just isn't credible. All the photos she used for evidence were also disproved by both photos and witnesses. There was plenty of evidence that she was the violent person. I do think abusers should be accountable for their actions but I also think that AH has used the fact that she is a women and a star to try to get even with JD because she didn't get everything her way. Men pay the ultimate price when a woman lies about them especially when it comes to physical and sexual abuse. Even when a man is proven to be innocent  they are forever marked, no one is willing to trust them again...just in case. When a woman is proven to have lied, she is still pitied. AH has just used the system to try and ruin the man she once said she loved because he rejected her. This is something that happens all the time in broken relationships. Fortunately, there were no children that AH could use against him because women like her often use the children against the other parent. AH has made a mockery of what is very serious situation for many many women and she should be ashamed of herself.",1,2022-06-02T02:40:14Z,2022-06-02T02:40:14Z

@makelvin,"The Observer Columnist clearly have not been following the case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard very closely. If she did, she should clearly see that Amber has been lying, falsifying evidence and making perjuries on the stand over and over again. Her story constant changes and inconsistent. In many cases, her own testimonies is contradictory with one another. Depp's attorneys have made a lot more convincing evidences as well as a lot more credible witness testimonies.

This is not a case of someone more powerful ended up winning the case over someone with less power. This is about revealing the truth of someone who is extremely manipulative and calculating in trying to destroy someone's life.

Just to be clear, I am not a Johnny Depp fan. I never really even liked his most famous role in those Pirates movies. Two of the movies that I kind of liked are Edward ScissorHands and Chocolat. I wasn't even following their stories all that closely until recently so I don't know why or how the British judicial system got it so wrong in the first place. I've only started following this case because it started trending very high on YouTube and I started following the trial. After watching all of the evidence and witness testimonies, it was clear to me that Amber is the real aggressor in this relationship and her evidences were circumstantial at best; but in many cases were clearly altered and/or fabricated. Some of the most damaging were her own testimonies on the stand with a clear case of perjury where she kept insisting that she already ""donated"" all of her $7 million from her divorced settlement to charity when she clearly did not.

Another thing I hate is how many of Heard's supporters kept trying to spin this case as a left vs right issue when it is about right and wrong. I hate Amber for the same reason why I hate Trump. Making bold face lies assuming everyone are idiots. I also personally think Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are both guilty because in both of these cases, the evidences and many witness testimonies were credible and consistent. Amber shamelessly hijacked the ""MeToo"" movement for her own gain. This is not her story to tell. Many of the MeToo activists should be furious for what Amber has done; but if after reviewing the case where she had clearly lied about her situation and yet still want continue to support her because they are afraid of losing the movement will only infuriate more people and truly discredit the movement itself. Please go back and review all of the evidence and witness testimonies and form an unbiased opinion. Don't try to get to the conclusion because you want to form a specific narrative. There is a reason why so many people support Johnny in this case and it is NOT all because they are his biggest fans.",0,2022-06-02T02:38:01Z,2022-06-02T02:38:01Z

I know it's hard to understand, but, for an example, lets pretend your sitting at home, and on the tv, you see a blue ball. To the right of that blue ball, is a news anchor, explicitly saying its a red ball. So we, as viewers, have that type of problem with your content. You cant tell us were not looking at a blue ball.

Interesting, I've done literature and content breakdown and the particular way this is formatted is pretty interesting nonetheless. Her statement specifically mentions about her words not being held against her because of her freedom of speech, yet that doesn't protect her from admission from wrongs.

@brucewayne9699,"This video shows why so many people distrust the media since it's so obviously biased. You show the video clip of Johnny Depp hitting cabinets and alleged pictures of bruises caused by Depp on Amber Heard, but what about all the evidence that contradicts her story? The tape recordings of her literally admitting to hitting him, admitting that she'd chase him down from room to room, conversations between the two of them where he repeatedly talks about wanting to deescalate situations when they became physical by removing himself from the situation, something that she clearly hated, literally stating so in the recordings, stating that she'd get so angry sometimes that she'd lose herself. Or what about the witness testimonies that completely contradict her stories? testimonies from credible witnesses like the police, who saw no bruising on her. Or the photographs that were clearly edited? She even entered the same photograph twice as separate pieces of evidence, claiming that they were from different dates in time, when it's obvious to anyone that they're the exact same photograph. There's also the other lies, like how she lied about not contacting the media to pose for a bruise photograph when she filed for divorce, or about not being the one who gave the video of Depp hitting cabinets to TMZ, and the lie about donating money to charity when she didn't. All clear lies that hint to her character and true nature and cast tremendous doubt on her entire story. It's quite obvious how bias your reporting is when you fail to mention these important pieces of evidence that were presented in court, which I can only imagine is because it goes against your narrative of 'believe all women', when the truth is that no, you should believe in evidence, fact and logical reasoning. Women can be abusers too, and it's quite clear that Amber Heard was one in this relationship and the Jury clearly saw that too, and it's why they sided with Depp and the reason he won. It's also why the majority of the public support him, not because they're die-hard Depp fans, but because they believe in actual justice and truth.",0,2022-06-02T01:43:22Z,2022-06-02T01:43:22Z

@pamfullerton5636,"it sounds like certain evidence that might have helped Johnny's case was deemed inadmissible in the UK trial - it also sounds like the judge was biased against Johnny and I've read there may even have been an Elon Musk influence on that trial as well.
So if you watched the USA trial, you'd know it has nothing to do with the MeToo movement going forward other than to say we should still deem people, regardless of gender to be innocent until proven guilty.  Amber's editorial defamed Johnny Depp and he has set the record straight with credible witnesses and evidence supporting the
fact that her claims against him were either false, overblown (especially in her hard-to-watch testimony directed at the jury) or in fact, malicious.  Her evidence did not line up with the abuse she described and her witnesses were not always credible. She is not a good representative for people who have been truly abused - she's been in a toxic relationship but she was an instigator of violence and she has no one to blame but herself for reaping the verdict and repercussions.  Hopefully she gets therapy.  Obviously this has been a hard lesson for Johnny as well but he can resume his art and career now that
the truth of the matter has come out.",7,2022-06-02T01:34:17Z,2022-06-02T01:34:17Z

@schoolingdiana9086,"Balanced journalism does **not** mean you bring on an apologizer for spousal abuse after you cover the details of the verdict. Martha needs to take some classes on what actual abuse looks like, what narcissistic abuse looks like, and realize she’s perpetuating victims of any gender not being able to be believed. Amber Heard’s other exes have regaled US media with details of her sordid partner abuse for decades; she feels empowered when she beats up men who are too well mannered to defend themselves. . . Every partner Amber Heard has had, has said she physically abused them. They aren’t in cahoots with each other; she’s a horrible human, and not worthy of being called a woman because she’s taken advantage of her superior position and used it to abuse those authentically taught that women are the foundation of society and must be respected. She dishonors her birthright superior position in society. —Thank God this jury and this court system saw the truth, and didn’t fall for her lies. It’s a win for all of us who are survivors of domestic violence. 

A giant F (fail) to the BBC for such poor journalism, allowing Martha to praise the perpetrator and act like the victim shouldn’t have gotten justice because of his gender. Maybe this passes for journalism in the UK, but you wouldn’t pass Journalism 101 with it here in the US (yes, I have a degree in it).",0,2022-06-02T01:26:23Z,2022-06-02T01:26:23Z

@artrandy,"This verdict is not in accordance with the BBC news agenda. I've been waiting hours for this item to appear on YT, as opposed to their website, where they've already nailed their colours to the mast. The BBC seem to think that this verdict is a set back for women's rights, although Im not sure the BBC knows whether to include an 'x' or a 'y' in the middle of 'women', or not. Maybe a beautiful, white, privileged, heterosexual actress is not worth an 'x'. The utter scepticism of Mr Sillitoe claiming languorously, ""and the jury, and much of the watching public, has after hearing it all, (theatrical pause,) believed him"". Maybe Johnny Depp having his life and reputation destroyed, is a sacrifice the Beeb think is worthwhile for the benefit of women, whether or not he abused his wife. Incredible. 

Furthermore, the leftwing Observer journo interviewed later assumed that Johnny Depp was an abuser, only qualifying that as an afterthought, for legal reasons I assume. Although she was so totally tongue tied and incoherent in her interview, that she came across as generally incompetent. Then there's the ""Industrial"" efforts to humilate Amber Heard online. Maybe, if the BBC had actually watched the whole trial, as many people have been doing, they would have made their mind up on the basis of the evidence, like millions of others, and the fact that Heard is such a bad liar and a bad actress, rather than shoving their political causes down our throat, and despising verdicts made in court that don't suit them. Thank God for jurys and real people. A plague on the BBC...............

Even if a man is bigger than a woman he is still allowed to defend himself. Amber has the history of domestic violence Depp does not. Depp has a history of breaking stuff and trashing rooms. Which probably why they jury did find in favor of Amber regarding defamation related to a “roughed up room”.

@bowens963,"Wow! That's SO incredible that this reporter Martha Gill (whoever she is) should STILL be clinging to the delusion that JD was the abuser. I can only conclude two possibilities here; Either she has not seen the trial (or couldn't be bothered) - and/or - the observer like all mainstream media cannot go back on their 'me too' siding against JD since this was reported in the UK earlier - they took a side - the wrong side it seems and now cannot go back on it without losing face. There is no 'me too' in this case. NO ONE else has come forward to say he was an abuser! ONLY Amber Heard. Anyone else who knows him including women with previous relations has come forward and said he was a gentleman (even with substance addiction!). 

So it is funny to me that Martha Gill quotes ONE court case and has no problem believing that (the UK case) but another court case, well this just has to be in error. It hasn't occurred to her that the more recent case has heard more evidence (and since the UK case more evidence has come to light) because in the UK trial JD had brought the case against the SUN newspaper, and not Amber Heard herself  he was restricted in what evidence could be brought forward to clear his name. 

I have never heard of Martha Gill before but from the outrageous comments she has made here I would not consider her to be an unbiased and professional reporter, neither would I have any faith now in the Observer if that is their standard of reporter. 

I'm not a JD supporter or fan and I think much of his lifestyle choices are certainly not to be followed or admired. But it seems strange to me that after he allowed his personal life to be exposed even to his detriment just to clear his name of the lies of violent abuse that was charged against him - and then the jury unanimously agreed he was wronged - that this reporter has the gall to say - 'yeah that's what they say, but I think he's still an abuser'. This reporter should instead be angry at Amber Heard who has set back all legitimate claimants of abuse going forward, because now everyone will think; Has he/she been abused or are they just clever manipulators like Amber Heard?

Shame on BBC too for allowing such a poisonous reporter - who is supposed to be unbiased - to be aired like this - they too must share the guilt of partisan news reporting. Is it only women who are abused? Or are men also abused by women?",22,2022-06-02T00:06:03Z,2022-06-02T00:08:17Z

@nataliav6681,"Hi there. This iceskating show does not exists in reality. Some criminals did this show to harras me . Some of them kidnapped me as a child and did digital copy of my young body without my permission. They  are making big money for selling online this show and meanwhile they are intimidating and harrasing me because they do not want anyone to know that the show is faken and almost all consist from digital copy of my childish body just with different digital girls heads. I do not know the names of the criminals who did this. But I have a suspition that they are Ahmetov from Moscow Snegeri, Medvetev and Motisin, Ahmatutov from Perm, Morosov from norikel, Mitini from Keansburg, and Dowbing ave Sea Clif. It is tbey probably were who used to steal me for making digital copy of my body for porno and other kind of stars for making digital tv shows. The criminals should be in jail till the end of life. They sometimes kidnap people making new radioheads band to serve them. Probably they from Perm Haiva area, they have kids who they ask to translate their cfiminal mind like Turpina, Tikhomirovi, Zenkovi and others who works for them. They are very bad people. Someone of them did many skeches from my family members for skeching faces of presidents and uk kingdom members. They skeched Clinted body as Paul and face for prime minister of UK. Some of these them always hacking me and selling my voice for banks, mobile company robots and other bad stealers company. They need to be stopped from making this criminal job.
This one of the criminals who stole copy of my body to attach his head sketch to it. Tbey are selling holes in peoples brains for publick humiliation and robbing.

@broaderdiscussion,"What has he won outside of money?  Does he really think his reputation has been restored?  I wouldn't be happy to see him turn up at any children's hospital now, in what condition?
Does anyone think he is a peaceful man?
Was the British judge wrong 14 out of 16 occasions?  Are our judges lacking judgement?

This parent to children is a junkie, a drunk and (I suspect given this) probably not a great person quite a proportion of the time.  But, on screen he's fantastic, so all forgotten.  Did the film studios know about his habits?  Is this another hidden story of a very suspect star, kept hidden by many?

Amber Heard is clearly not innocent, has personality issues.  She exaggerates and lies and it is this that she has been caught out by.  Quite right, she has to pay.

But I never met good drunk junkies; I think the bigger picture is being sidelined to a smaller case of in-house fighting.

@lisahale2026,"This is why I don't follow main stream media. I watched the whole trial on you tube, live from the court. This isn't about me too at all. It wasn't all these teenage fans screaming at him, people saw the evidence and could clearly see she was lying. We are grown up we can make our own minds up, you dont need to try to malnipulate us like amber did. She admitted herself on the recordings she hit him. She admitted this again in court. SHE SAID SHE PHYSICALLY ASSULTED HIM. This is sickening that people can't see that men can be victims. People act like women don't have the ability to manipulate, lie and physical harm a man. Its such a sad day when women, who ask for right of those abused to speak up, still call depp an abuser after its clear he wasn't. People did believe her until they knew the real truth. I wasn't a depp fan particularly so this has nothing to do with his Hollywood so called ""power"" if he was so powerful how did he lose his roles in upcoming films. They are doing exactly what amber did to him. Its proven in law she defamed him. The jury, all of the jury decided on all 3 counts. It is notoriously difficult to win a defamation case so clearly the jury saw what we all saw. You can try to snuff out the truth like you do everything and try to push your narrative but johnny has spoken and the majority of the public wholeheartedly believe him. But hey... this isn't surprising from the BBC. They don't like the fact we are all getting our news, the real truthful news from honest, independent direct sources and that frightens them that they are losing their power.

@KingsguardRP,"Who is the supposed 'columnists'? 
The UK trial was a farce in the sense that her evidence of abuse and violence wasnt scrutinised at all and in fact, the judge refused to accept a lot of the Depp evidence and to make matters worse, the judge took Amber Heard by her word on the 12 out of the 13 cases, the 1 case the judge didnt take up was because Amber Heards statement didnt have  a case attached to it.  The judge also believed Amber Heard when she said ahe had donated the money to ACLU. Depp didnt have the benefit of ACLU testifying against that claim.
It is such myopic feminist masquerading as journalists who damage the cause of women. 
Even though the Sun couldnt have written their article with malice due to believeing Amber Heard, it didnt rule out going after the source of the lies, so the UK trial was inconsequential. 
Long story short, she lied and her lies has been proven in a court of law.
Yet, she still has the audacity to come on BBC to claim Heard was an 'imperfect victim' and that the courts benefits men? On what planet do the courts benefit men when its entrenched with positive sexism favouring women due to seeing women as some demure innocent  and incapable creatures that need protection.

AH is not a victim, stop victimising her per se , the court in the US held her accountable and thus ruled that JD is to be compensated! The hefty compensation is a clear indicator, this reporter ought to learn how to respect an official court ruling and stop spilling this clearly politically inspired content. In fact if she calls JD in this interview an abuser without proof, facts etc , does this not amount to defamation as well? To my knowledge you can’t just accuse people of such horrible things and then expect no consequences.",29,2022-06-01T22:41:49Z,2022-06-01T22:41:49Z

When something continues to happen for more than one generation, the new generation  considers  the norm and they start thinking this is how its supposed to be, this is why Islam is teaching you, to question your faith, when you know that there is something wrong here, you feel there is something wrong, you question it in order to find the answer that is correct, this is how people come on the right path So dont be afraid Islam has the answers.

( The belief, Islam In short form)
The belief in One God, One Creator, Allah = The only one worthy of whorship, allone and there is nothing like Him.
Allah send us guidens, In form of Prophets like, Abraham/Ibrahim, Moses/Musa,Jesus/Isa , Muhammad  ﷺ  and many more, peace be upon all of them.
The belief in all Angels and Revelations like the Original  Zabur/Psalms, Tora/Tawrat, the Gospel/Injil and the Quran. 
The belief in the Day of Judgement and the Hereafter.
To believe in all of them and that Muhammad  ﷺ  Is the last and final Prophet and the Quran the last and final revelation from Allah, until Judgement Day.
By following and believing in all of  these, you are a Muslim = The one who submits to the will of the Creator.

The evidance for this belief are the Quran and the Hadith, you can check both and study it and  listen to those who done it, to understand this believe better and to learn more about it.

Maybe you have a bad picture about Muslims and Islam  from things that you heard or seen in the media, but isn't it better to make your own picture, before judge about something ? I'm sure you will discover a new side of Islam, a side of beauty and peace, kindness and compassion, you just have to allow it <3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9np1b4C3XnE / Medina as Non Muslim - Solo Travel in Saudi Arabia

@primeparadox9796,"Really disappointed by the BBC. It is a straightforward case where Heard was lying. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the UK case is an anomaly. Why is this verdict not also a win for victims? There are always believable and unbelievable victims. We are regressing if we think Johnny is not a believable victim, just because he’s a man. What shoddy, lazy analysis. Johnny is an imperfect victim, more so than Amber Heard, who’s the “perfect” victim before this trial. she is white, rich, beautiful, outspoken and well connected. 


Maybe you should be open minded to all victims and give them their rights to evidence things. That just happened and Amber had no evidence.


Stop demeaning people who’s been following and formulating a prop-Depp opinion as mere fans. Similarly, the Jury isn’t stupid… it’s not like this court is all about not taking female victims seriously… there was no MeToo - nobody else came forward alongside Amber Heard.",5,2022-06-01T22:31:13Z,2022-06-01T22:37:20Z

@HarJBeRw,"The BBC's coverage of this case has been horrendously and consistently biased over these past six weeks. For having followed their written articles on this case these past months, I have seen them give continual coverage to Amber's claims and remain virtually silent on the mountains of evidence contradicting her. I find it quite telling that at no point in this coverage do they consider Mr Depp from the perspective of a victim, but rather seemingly denigrate the idea that he claimed to be one in the first place, and the fact that he suffered tremendous reputational and career-damage following her article.

The idea that this verdict is somehow a degradation of the Me Too movement rather than a strengthening of it is also laughable. That was the entire point of Johnny Depp's initial testimony: to display that yes ""I too, as a man, am a victim of domestic violence"". This verdict helps facilitate a society in which men are not afraid to come forward as victims, without fear of being denigrated or turned into abusers themselves - all because Johnny Depp has laid the path forward for this. Although I am deeply saddened by the coverage of this specific news channel on this topic, especifally considering how much I typically respect the BBC's journalistic integrity and work, the result of this trial nonetheless fills me with hope for the future.",405,2022-06-01T22:30:01Z,2022-06-01T22:30:29Z

@anatolia0222,Which trial were y'all watching that you're presenting some sort of pro Amber Heard coverage.

@busterdafydd3096,"I agreeing with most comments here.  I would say though, what the BBC should be saying (as there was a counter sue) and why other trials won on Johnny is the fact that this was toxic relationship.  Johnny most probably did do some nasty things but so has Amber and hence all these cases should have been net zero but amber broke her NDA on multiple occasions and hence that is why Johnny won.

Amber didn't need to sign the NDA at the divorce and she did so under no duress.",2,2022-06-01T22:15:12Z,2022-06-01T22:15:12Z

Another poor example of journalism from the BBC. The focus on the fan support, and Amber’s side of this story instead of facts. 

It’s not about belief. It’s about justice and truth. Ironically known as “the American way”.
