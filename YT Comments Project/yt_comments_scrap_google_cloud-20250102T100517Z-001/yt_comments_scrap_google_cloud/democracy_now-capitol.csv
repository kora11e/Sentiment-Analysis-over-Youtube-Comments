@Faith_100,This one sided news reporting is destroying America. Trump requested the guard days before January 6 . Did you call Ashli a  Racist who do you think you are calling a person you don‚Äôt know a racist? Democrats are the racist who lost the civil war to Republicans.,0,2023-03-08T14:22:05Z,2023-03-08T14:22:05Z
@ilovethe1950s,"The new standard for what is now considered acceptable forms of protest was lowered in 2020 by the Democrats to include damaging federal property, attacking law enforcement, and acting as though your grievances come before the world at large.

And when ‚Äúmostly peaceful"" protests include 574 riots, 28 deaths, 2,000 police officer injuries, $2 billion dollars in damage, and over 150 federal buildings damaged, it's safe to say that your own tolerance for violence is quite high and the bar for what is ‚Äúmostly peaceful‚Äù is quite low.

And when that amount of death, destruction, and mayhem gets excused, going so far as to have your next Vice President setting up bail funds for those involved in such activity, do you know what many Trump supporters on January 6th were probably thinking?

@pliniablue1473,"Maybe it would be a good idea to go deeper into what moves this particular kind of Trump supporters (there are a few kind).  They say they are the forgotten Americans because they are not doing so well.  If you think about it their revolt might not be moved by much different than the French yellow jackets who are also not doing as well.  I want to believe that racism is just something they hold on to as to feel relevant and blame, though if it were more, it needs understanding and social programs for people of different races to interact in a friendly manner. I think Biden is right being reluctant to go after Trump as imprisoning him could cause deep resentment right now.   I think he should address these people directly understanding where they are at.  Unsettling divisions run through societies worldwide, not just the US.  Misery has to be uplifted; inequality cannot continue this way.

Suggest should be patterned off the SCANDINAVIAN countries then the USA must expect more of the same from all sectors of society.

@clearfield2009,There were many credible reports that one major faction (not all) of the MAGA terrorists were very connected to Eric Prince - Blackwater - and brother of Betsy DeVos. Prince had to shut Blackwater down after it was accused by the United Nations of Crimes Against Humanity - operating rogue off site torture programs in Iraq. Prince came back with yet another paramilitary company that operates in FLA.  There are reports that MAGA extremists met and planned this attack on the capitol months ago. Presumably Trump was fully aware. The added MAGA crowds helped to make this attack look ‚Äúgrassroots.‚Äù  Many on Twitter - including Glenn Kirschner are asking how much of this attack was an ‚Äúinside job.‚Äù Yes - some capitol police were defending the capitol but if you watch some of the videos - there are other security police who are seen opening the doors for the MAGA and taking selfie‚Äôs. Am not kidding. I strongly believe there is no way those MAGA could have gotten into the capitol without cooperation from some factions of the security / police forces. Trump was asked to send national guard at the height of the crisis - this is reported by all major news media - and Trump refused. Inside job.

and then I hear about all the horrible shit going on in the world, and I get worked up, but at the end she tells me that she is still ""Amy Goodman"", and that is what calms down the anxiety from the news.

After the various federal and state courts heard and rendered a decision on their respective complaints; and did not adequately make a clear and convincing statement to the public; as to the ruling of the courts; are guilty of sedition and inciting a riot.

@ZeitgeisterOm,"I have come to the conclusion the capitalist system is the root cause of most problems we see today.


The capitalist system drives human behavior. At the heart of the capitalist system is the constant programming to consume. A system predicated on infinite consumption assumes that we live on a planet with infinite resources.


This is where We call the current capitalist system unscientific because we live on a closed system on one planet with limited resources.


Any system where you're forced to submit your labor for income is really not that far away from being slavery.


We've taken into account capitalism has long history of failure going back it has a trend of depressions or complete collapses we all know about the Great Depression of the 1920s more recently there was¬†the.com¬†crash in the 90s and the 2008 recession and most recently the complete failure of capitalism to cope with the Coronavirus.


¬†the main problems we find with capitalist system is it has no connection Public Health it has no sustainability standards built within.¬†

¬†Capitalism constantly drives people towards a selfish greedy behavior. Capitalism is directly responsible for us having a classist Society where there is different tiers depending on your wealth.¬†¬†

we know through science that when wealth is more equally distributed the health of a Nation is enhanced.

Capitalism doesn't seek to equally distribute wealth it doesn't seek to take care of basic needs like food water and shelter Medical needs.

We need a new Economic model based in science and meeting the needs of people While maintaining Environmental Balance¬†
Solutions to the problems created by the capitalist system entail democratizing the workplace it's time that we put decision-making power back in the hands of the workers.
Worker cooperatives will be key in reversing top down control structures. In worker cooperatives decisions are made from the bottom up.",3,2021-01-07T15:13:30Z,2021-01-07T15:13:30Z

@danield.7359,"Nazi comes from national SOCIALISTS Amy. They never were the right, they are extreme lefties. Lots of similarities with all other variants of the left, only more robust methods - certainly not democratic methods. Right/left comes from the first constitutional monarchy in France, before the French revolution. Left were the progressives, right the conservatives.
It is an old and proven method to send extremists, agents provocateurs into peacefully demonstrating people. So they can be called ""mob"" or worse.
