@alexsidletskiy5923,There was no state such as Syria. Syrian Arab Republic was founded by the mandate of France. The mandate was the reason for Assad ‚Äúregime ‚Äú. Assad was hated by many but tolerated by many minorities as well. The country people refer as Syria from one regime can and up in another regime. A religious one that can be and is not the best choice. Quite few minorities in Syria don‚Äôt want rebels especially considering rebels have only declarations . They yet to prove they are state worthy. Just because Damascus under control which by the way can be credited to former government doesn‚Äôt mean minorities who live in provinces are safe. If some minorities want they can have their own republic that‚Äôs on the border with Israel. Israel is there to defend own country however minorities who live in that region can benefit from that . Israel is the only democracy and people in Syria unlike in religious Arab states not used nor like religious regimes. Israel sort of Russian Federation in Crimea and Donbas,0,2024-12-13T01:44:53Z,2024-12-13T01:45:45Z

@MrJethroha,"A lot of brain dead fox viewers who know nothing about Syria spouting nonsense in this comments section, makes sense as American news broadcasters have totally neglected Syria for years. This was brought about mainly by two rebel groups backed by Turkey, HTS who are islamists and many are former Al Qaeda, and SNA, who are secular former Free Syrian Army. Then in the south other rebels came out of the woodwork, mostly Druze militia and former FSA, and took Damascus with US backed FSA help. Then in the east is the SDF also secular and somewhat supported by the US. So currently 3/4 armed groups in Syria are not Islamists, Turkey is the most significant foreign backer with the US as a less important factor, but overall the rebels themselves were just stronger than Assad, the Syrian Army was not willing to fight. There will be some continued fighting between SNA and SDF because Turkey doesn't like the Kurdish militia, but hopefully this dies down as talks among the opposition begin. US pulling support away from the SDF and FSA now will only empower the Islamists and make it more or less a binary power struggle mediated solely by Turkey.",0,2024-12-08T18:32:03Z,2024-12-08T18:32:03Z

@johnmanigaulte1556,"THE TRUMP REGIME MAY SOON COLLAPSE, AS BLUE STATES CONSIDER SEPARATING FROM TRUMP'S UPCOMING DICTATORSHIP!!
      First, the Supreme Court BORE FALSE WITNESS of the Jan 6 bloody attack on our democracy and allowed Trump‚Äôs name to be put on the ballot for the 2024 ‚Äúelection.‚Äù The ‚Äúelection‚Äù of Donald J. Trump was therefore invalid. Congress allowed an invalid ‚Äúelection‚Äù to occur, so Congress is equally guilty in destroying our democracy. 
     ‚ÄúTrump decides what is and is not actionable under the criminal laws of the United States,‚Äù said Kimberly Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law who has studied constitutional law and the separation of powers, so the rule of law here in America will soon be defined by King Trump, and our courts have already shown how impotent they are with respect to protecting our civil liberties and demanding Equal Justice Under Law.
      Our CHILDREN need parents with COURAGE, not adults IN DENIAL of the massive political mental illness infecting our country. When we EMBRACE reality, the solution appears, and it is NOT protests in the streets, because Trump already signaled how he will respond: with an armed military attack against unarmed civilians. MLK did not have to face THAT scenario! 
     REALITY is telling us to THINK before acting foolishly, doing the same as has been done before, in different circumstances, and expecting the same results! That's insanity. Our courts are IMPOTENT against TRUMP! He was psychotically ""elected"" after ordering a violent coup in which his own Vice-President was nearly HANGED! 
     We need to petition our GOVERNORS to LEAVE Trump‚Äôs new country: MAGAmerica, a country where ‚Äúsome animals are more equal than others.‚Äù MAGAmerica is unconstitutional insanity, and we need take no part in it. 
    When Pennsylvania LEAVES the union, it can accept Nippon Steel‚Äôs wonderful offer. When California LEAVES the union, it can trade with Mexico and Canada, etc. Other STATES can keep their tax dollars for their own uses; for example, states that have become nation-states (new countries, like Ukraine) can provide housing for homeless vets or retirement income for seniors, etc. 
     GOD gave us FREE WILL, so we need not bow down to King Trump and accept his tyranny, like cowards whimpering before a wannabe dictator, struggling to make ""the system"" work when it champions a convicted rapist waltzing into the White House. 
     Are we daft?

@TomZart,"WHY MUST WE STUDY HISTORY -??
Mankind itself is the one to blame
That all through history, the story's the same.
Peace, like love, can be hard to acquire
Subject always to enemy fire.

The cost of freedom is sometimes high
Extremely more when our loved one's die.
Men and women pledged to fight and serve
And it's our support that they deserve.

When war breaks out, boundaries change
And all who die are a token
Of the rage that must run its course
Before words of peace are spoken.

The lucky survive and return home
Though in their dreams their fate is unsure.
War may be hell, but confinement is worse
Cause afterward you're never as you were.

Some have asked why must we study history
It just encourages us to live in the past.
When we forget history we repeat its mistakes
As the outcome of humanity is cast.
