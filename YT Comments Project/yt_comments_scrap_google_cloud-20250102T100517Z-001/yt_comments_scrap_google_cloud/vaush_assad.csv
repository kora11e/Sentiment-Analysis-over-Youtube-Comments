@louisthehuman6077,"I'm tentatively optimistic that Al Golani and the HTS are going to be a posative force in Syria. I think the focus on building a civil society, indicating that there are going to be protections for Syrian minorities in the state they want to build and some posative actions that have already been taken like allowing Christian churches in HTS controlled areas to reopen, make me hopeful that this might be different from Iran. Another detail that makes me think that this isn't going to go the religious fundamentalist route is that Al Golani was interviewed by a woman. It seems like a small thing but pushing women out of public spaces seems to be a major aspect of fundamentalist Muslims regimes so the fact that he was willing to speak to a female journalist and treat the interview like a serious engagement seems like a very good sign. I have no idea how inscere it is, but implicitly the message of speaking to this particular journalist is that Al Golani, and by extension the HTS, think women can be involved in politics and in media, at least to some extent, which I don‚Äôt think a group like the Taliban or ISIS would  ever allow.",1,2024-12-08T11:43:48Z,2024-12-08T11:43:48Z
