@VelvetJazz,"Regardless of the catalyst, we do need to dialogue about US privatized health insurance. I‚Äôve worked in healthcare for years, people avoid seeking treatment they cannot risk getting billed for, they  DIE because our hc system rations care through denials, which also cause bankruptcy and homelessness. Most developed countries have universal hc. Aging Boomers may have strained the system recently, but most people in those democratic countries love their hc system and have better outcomes and greater longevity than the US.",3,2024-12-20T00:52:34Z,2024-12-20T00:52:34Z

@Alchemicalromance93,In Germany they have private healthcare AND universal healthcare.  You don't have to choose!  They have something like 12 companies that have to cover every single person and provide full coverage.   The free market comes into effect when the companies compete for greater percentages of the market.  If a company is not doing a good job they lose customers to a competitor.   The politicians here dont want us to know about this.   So they keep shoveling yhis garbage into our mouths.  Screw this propaganda!,2,2024-12-19T04:45:56Z,2024-12-19T04:46:32Z

@sleepingsleepsleep,"I work in healthcare revenue cycle for a non profit children‚Äôs hospital, and handle insurance reimbursements on claims. We are fighting daily with UHC and Anthem to get medically necessary claims paid, have weekly meetings on the books with their reps to go over denial reasons, jump through their myriad hoops. We have contracts with them saying what they are supposed to reimburse for each patient. 

They will regularly underpay/not reimburse for services THEY ARE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY. That portion of a patient‚Äôs bill never gets dropped to the patient, and the hospital ends up eating the cost. This hurts EBIDTA, the financial forecasting team then further raises cost of care to zero out the books each year, which comes back on insurance and patients, then insurance doesn‚Äôt pay again and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to make them. What are you going to do, stop taking patients with UHC?? Get real. 

I am literally in the belly of the beast and agree with Luigi‚Äôs manifesto. The for profit healthcare system is a scam where everyone is passing the bill off to each other and the only real people paying are the uninsured/badly insured patients who can‚Äôt afford the constantly rising cost.

@cventer838,"Oh my! This Luigi has cause a huge shaking there over in the USA.  It is simply so sad to learn that SO many struggling Americans get denied the proper help they need.  It's totally unacceptable.  Bankruptcy caused by medical aid denials.  How aweful.  

I think if you are Elon Musk or Ben Shapiro and you have 50 Million or 400 Billion, if you've worked to earn it, it's your privilege.  Let's just be reasonable.  Hard work doesn't fall into your lap.  

What Luigi did is called cold-blooded murder.  I had spinal surgery, and I know all about it.  This case will unravel in due time.  I am very sure it's a mental health issue.  It's not normal to kill someone.  

Doesn't USA have government hospitals where people can get treated for free?  It's difficult to understand.  It sounds like a government medical aid scheme.  I'm at a loss for words!  

Is this truely a left or right issue?  Diseases and afflictions don't choose sides.  We should always show compassion for the struggling and the need, the poor and afflicted.  Your USA public education system is very sad.  If you have been privileged to get a proper education, cherish it and rather do something to uplift the rest.  Killing a CEO is horrible.  I am sure they could have rather approached it via discussions.  So heartbreaking and unnecessary!  This is not class wars. It's your governments issue.  Don't you have clinics and university hospitals that treat the struggling people for free?  I am totally stunned.  Come and visit SA, you can learn something new!

Ben, I had a fusion surgery at a top South African Hospital, Life Groenkloof in Pretoria.  It used to be called, The Little Company of Mary Hospital.  The hospital specializes in orthopedics and spinal surgery.  It's situated right close to prestigious schools that play rugby and Loftus Park where the Blue Bulls play.  I took my own son there post a rugby match and broken arm.  Saturdays are busy there!  I'm 2 years post surgery, turning 50 on Valentine's Day next year.  You do recovery therapy post-surgery.  I am doing fantastic!  It take about 2  years for the damaged nerves to heal, but you heal.  I even know a woman who runs marathons a few years post surgery.  It's a complete myth!  Or must a feel blessed to know South-Africa has fantastic doctors!

Luigi's operation must have been botched, but you can fix that too.  This is heartbreaking, honestly!  There is life post spinal surgery.  I am SO much better off.  I'm completely greatful.

You should always do your homework regarding which surgeon to use.  My Dr basically sais he's a back mechanic.  It's a ""mechanical ""fix with titanium screws.  You need to behave quietly for a couple of weeks for the fusion to happen, with the implanted bone to grow, which fuses the operation.  You don't pick up heavy stuff and do your physio.  It takes time, but I can do all the work I did previously.  Back pain is a horrible thing, but it does not righteous an assassination!  Let's be a bit realistic here.  The CEO follows company policies.

Edit:  it feels like I writing an sa here.  Luigi was born with a spinal defect, as was I.  He was an athlete, I did SA track and field championships during my school years.  There is always some kind of agrivating factor that triggers your injury.  I had one thin and worn cushion.  Had 3 childbirths, it affects back issues and traveled the mama taxi to and fro for my very active and participating children, around the clock.  Late night choir and orchestra, the driving caused my first sciatic episode, the buldged and rupture cusshion caused by a chiropractor.  It's hellishly painful.  Usually after a 3rd episode, they operate.  BUT Luigi could have gone to a physio that specializes in sports injuries.  Our Springboks physio helped me to use other muscles so I could walk.  It's all about, research, patience, and endurance.  You CAN overcome it.  

Sweet Lord Jesus.  No disrespect to the Jesus I love.  Mushrooms... You can get help from naturopath with healthy herbs, ionized footbaths, sound therapy etc to detox your body.  There are diets to follow, the right kind of excersize etc to strengthen your body post sciatica, massage helps.  Cannabis eg triggers schizophrenia per 1ste usage.  Food for thought.  Stick to herbs, they are God's gift.

I Have to laugh a bit here at the end of my long comment.  The physiotherapy booklet I got post surgery gives you guidance for do's and don't.  One being, don't fall pregnant for such and such a period post surgery.  You can give birth post spinal surgery.  I think men just can't deal with pain.  üòä

Shame, I wish I could have sat down with with young man and given him guidance as to healthy recovery.  His parents must be devestated!",0,2024-12-14T16:43:44Z,2024-12-14T18:23:55Z

Woman in her forties, suffering from undetermined illness seeks medical services.

2)Woman goes directly to medical testing lab and is promptly provided requested testing services.
3)Test results take a couple days to process but indicate a massive infection and woman is notified to attend Hospital X where a medical team will be waiting for her arrival.
4)Woman arrives at Hospital X and is immediately processed and provided what was ultimately determined to be a life saving surgery.
4)Spends a further eighteen days in recovery, attended by three separate medical teams.
5)Upon discharge is provided complete support to further facilitate long term recovery‚Ä¶a full recovery is achieved and my son didn‚Äôt lose his mother and myself a wife.

At 9 years old I had thoughts of death from the pain (spinal tap that they used a needle that was too long) and insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover the pain meds. My poor parents had to watch and hear me suffer. A child bald and alone in chronic pain. If I had that much pain today and I had the means to take out the ones that prevented my relief I might have. Pain is just as bad for the mind as say shrooms to keep with the topic. There‚Äôs a reason what pain is used for torture to make other act in ways that goes against their own natural will. Pain almost made me take my own life on a few occasions. I‚Äôm stronger today from it. Long story short this is between the rich and poor. Yes he was rich but the moment they denied him relief they treated him the same they treat the rest of us. What he did was not just but between the pain and suffering it was the only way he could find peace (although still messed up none the less) not peace of body but peace of mind.",1,2024-12-11T13:25:49Z,2024-12-11T13:25:49Z

I feel like I'd almost been living a rock, but due to some friends after only just moving from Hawaii, I had only just heard of this story of the murder of thisban CEO.. 
Such a horrible act and I pray this man receives the justice he deserves. 
Although, sobering, something I felt Completely DISGUSTING was that I had received a Tiktok notification that Don Lemon was live on both YouTube and Tiktok today, which as a Conservative Republican I enjoy listening to the other sides view of facts and how distorted their way of thinking is, but I ended up getting muted by Don's moderators after voicing my disgust of comments by both Don and his guest Tim going on and on about ""how hot"" they both thought the murderer is. 
They also seemed to be very put out on the acquittal and complained about Daniel Penny and his trial leaning in his favor.
It was shocking that Mr Nealy's dad,  who wasn't present after his own mom's murder,  let alone all the years he left his son grow up in the foster system. He Now shows up after his death when he tries to Now try and get money out off his death? It's another George Floyd story of a criminal that loses their lives from drug overdoses while blaming others after intervention. BLM again shows to for media for clout. They should be ashamed.

But even if you agree with the aim, it still makes no sense because it has no chance of working - the regime is not competent enough to follow through.

He was interested in Game Dev; not a stretch to think someone with programming experience and an interest in games might be playing with 3D models.

Absurd yes, and absurdly realistically modeled, right down to the internal components, mechanism, springs, and animations of it all, not that you'll ever see it in game. They do the same thing with guns. 

Someone finds that on their computer and comes to the wrong conclusion, and just like that: ""Ghost Gun"". And that's how you break the law without ever intending to do so; or, get charged for something you didn't do and have to fight it, likely unsuccessfully, in court.
I don't really know, but watching the CNN breakdown of the guys life, or reading it rather, and seeing how they handled this, and the ""miracle"" capture thanks to a ""good samaritan"", and knowing full well the media likes to stretch rumors and misinterpretations, and opinions out to be ""facts""

@Ben-zr4ho,"Hes my take on universal socialized healthcare. The United States should have it. Let me be clear. The UNITED STATES should have it. Why? We invent and development a majority of the life saving drugs, medical equipment, and procedures. The US companies the go and negotiate with other countries that do have specialized healthcare and cut them all sorts of deals because the government is negotiating in bulk. Meanwhile they are selling medicine at ridiculous inflated prices in the US so they make all their money back. Its a fact that these companies actually structure their financials to maintain a certain profit by selling in America at high prices first foremost and then the deals they make with say Englad are secondary. Basically we are subsidizing the entire worlds healthcare with American dollars just like we subsidize their safety with our military. These countries wont even pay their NATO costs theyve agrerd to or provide the troops theyve promised. Even England can no longer field and supply a single expeditionary DIVISION. Things should be the other way around. We should take the drugs and equipment we developed in this country, give it to free for all our people, and then sell it at a premium to every one else. I also tell Europeans when they starting getting smug about, ""barbaric US not having universal health insurance..."" They should stay quiet because the day the US gets socialized medicine is the day the rest of the world loses theirs. Of course thats why it will probably never happen. Too many politicians lile Obama and Biden who are America and Americans last.",0,2024-12-11T07:33:53Z,2024-12-11T07:34:23Z

@jenia3031,"The working class is trapped in a brutal cycle of exploitation and disposability. From the moment they enter the workforce, they are forced to accept low wages, poor benefits, and exhausting conditions, all while generating immense profits for the wealthy. Their labor is extracted until their bodies are worn down‚Äîoften prematurely due to stress, overwork, and inadequate healthcare access.

As they age and become less ""profitable"" to the system, they are discarded. When healthcare is most needed, they are met with claim denials, exorbitant medical bills, and insurance loopholes designed to maximize corporate profits at the cost of human lives. Seniors are left to fend for themselves, dying from treatable conditions because they are deemed too expensive to keep alive.

Meanwhile, their children‚Äîthe next generation‚Äîare funneled into the same exploitative system. From underfunded schools to predatory student loans, young workers are primed to replace their parents in low-wage, high-demand jobs. The cycle ensures a steady stream of labor while keeping families perpetually poor, overworked, and dependent on systems rigged against them.

This is not an accident‚Äîit‚Äôs by design. Capitalism thrives on this churn, where humans are treated as disposable cogs in a machine that values profit over life.

@Catbi_,"I want to begin by unequivocally stating that I do not support murder in any form; it is a horrific act that must be condemned with the utmost seriousness. Let me address your position with clarity and precision. You seem to be operating under the presumption that a system's legality equates to its moral correctness. This is a profound and dangerous fallacy. History offers us no shortage of examples where legality and morality diverged in catastrophic ways. The N@z!s, for instance, institutionalized the persecution and extermination of millions of Jews, all under the auspices of a legal framework they created. That system was lawful by its own decrees, but it was fundamentally immoral by any rational, ethical, or humane standard.

The existence of such systems forces us to ask: if the framework is inherently corrupt, do we simply abdicate our moral responsibility because the system says, 'This is the way things are'? Of course not. The moral compass of individuals, acting collectively, is precisely what led to the dismantling of the N@z! regime. And let us not forget: it required a war‚Äîa violent, extraordinary repudiation of that system‚Äîto restore some semblance of justice.

Now, to suggest that the systemic rejection of people's claims by insurance companies, leading to preventable deaths, carries no moral weight because it is 'legal' is an egregious misstep. Such a stance is not just indifferent‚Äîit is abhorrent. To elevate the wealth and power of a CEO above the lives of thousands of citizens, whose toil and suffering contribute to the very systems that make that wealth possible, reveals an unconscionable disregard for basic human decency.

Let us examine the implications of your position further. You appear to dismiss the suffering of the many as inconsequential, as though human life is subordinate to the mechanisms of profit. But systems have faces. They are not abstractions; they are run by individuals making decisions‚Äîdecisions that prioritize financial gain over human dignity. And those faces are represented by individuals like the CEO you defend, who preside over this callous machinery.

To your wealth and arrogance: let me remind you that these privileges exist because ordinary people‚Äîwhose lives, in your view, seem to carry negligible significance‚Äîconsume your content, subscribe to your platforms, and participate in the economy that sustains you. The sheer hubris required to disregard their suffering while reaping the fruits of their support is staggering.

If you argue that systems define morality, then you must also reconcile your opposition to historical atrocities carried out under legalized frameworks. Or are you suggesting that those atrocities were moral simply because they were sanctioned by the systems that perpetrated them? If that is not your argument‚Äîand I dearly hope it is not‚Äîthen you must concede that legality does not dictate morality, and by extension, that your defense of these corporate practices is indefensible.

It is not wealth, nor power, nor the system itself that defines moral value‚Äîit is the choices we make when faced with the suffering of others. And you, by your words, have chosen indifference.",6,2024-12-11T01:31:56Z,2024-12-11T01:31:56Z

@paulclarke3132,"Ben,  who do you think made the system complex and why?     I started practicing medicine in 1978 and the system was dirt simple.  first of all, patients could go to any doctor they wanted.    I would provide a service, bill the insurance the going rate, the insurance would typically pay 80% up to an amount specified in the policy and then pay 100% after that.  The difference between good insurance and poor insurance was how high the deductibles was and what the amount was when the company started paying 100%  Everyone had a secretary in their office that filed the insurance claims for big procedures but filing was so simple, most of the time patients filed their own for small stuff like office visits.    Doctors set their own fees, and we usually got that from medical journals that published the averages for your area of the country,  Then in the 80's insurance companies started introducing all sorts of dirty tactics keep from paying claims and try to control what you charged.  One of the first things they did was try to get the doctor to accept a fee that was lower than he usually charged.  To twist his arm into accepting the lower fee they would pay the doctor directly if he agreed but if he wouldn't reduce his charge they would pay but send the money to the patient.  Of course, they did this because they knew that some patients would keep the money and not pay the doc. The big thing was developing the immensely confusing coding system where everything we did, from diagnosis to treatment,  had to be expressed as a number on the insurance form.  The coding was made so complex that even the doctors couldn't understand the coding, let alone a secretary.  Procedures that used to be charged as one lump sum now has to be split into all the different components and each had a number and had to be billed separately.  As if that wasn't bad enough, there were things called ""modifiers"" that were  often necessary.  This all caused a lot of confusion and many a insurance claim was denied over even the smallest error made by the secretary. Another tactic they developed was to create the ""participating provider"". This was where the company would go to a doctor who was not very successful and get him to accept a fee that was a lot lower than everyone else's in the area. [usually some foreign guy who could barely speak English]     If the patient agreed to go to that doc instead of the guy they'd been going to all their lives, the company would pay a much larger percentage of the his bill but If they stayed with their own doctor who hadn't agreed to lower his fee, [ a non-participating doctor]  they would pay  a much smaller percentage of what he charged. Basically, this was medical care by the lowest bidder and had nothing to do with competency, This was the  company's  tactic to force everyone to accept what they wanted to pay or get starved into submission.  Theres a lot more I could say from the doctor's side of it and I haven't even touched on the tactics they use on the poor patients.   So after 40 years of this, I wouldn't go to the extent of killing someone over it but I really don't have any great degree of sympathy for the guy either.  I also don't think anyone who hasn't had to endure severe chronic pain understands the effect that has on a person and to me it's easy to see how this guy to the point where he broke.   If I were his lawyer, I would make a temporary insanity defense.",1,2024-12-11T01:05:57Z,2024-12-11T01:05:57Z
@AlexA-hg4sf,"Companies are allowed to make profit, but they EXPECT to make the same (or higher) profit the next year too. So what happens when doctor salaries increase from $200K to $300K a year? Insurance companies will not negotiate with hospitals and will instead pass the cost onto you through premiums. Or they will ""decide"" to not insure some procedures. The system is unbelievably lazy and unfair and everyone in the chain makes a lot of $$ except for the patients at the other end",1,2024-12-11T01:04:30Z,2024-12-11T01:04:30Z

@TheMilanka77,"""Why Luxury Fragrances Are Losing Their Spark"" I recently moved on from a job representing brands like Carolina Herrera, Paco Rabanne, and Jean Paul Gaultier, and I want to share my honest thoughts about the challenges I faced. These brands have long been known for their iconic fragrances, but the truth is that their relevance in today's market has diminished. Customers are looking for innovation, authenticity, and products that feel meaningful--and these brands haven't kept up. Instead of adapting to what people want, they rely on outdated strategies and leave employees to carry the burden of pushing sales. If these products were still truly desirable, we wouldn't have to beg for sales or compete for scraps. The real problem? Accountability. Leadership behind these brands seems unwilling to evolve or take responsibility for their failure to adapt. They let employees take the fall, cutting hours and piling on pressure, while ignoring the fact that the decline starts at the top. It's time for brands like these to take a hard look at themselves. The era of mass-produced luxury that coasts on name recognition is over. Consumers are smarter, more selective, and gravitating toward smaller, independent creators who actually care about quality and their customers. To anyone considering luxury fragrances this holiday season, I encourage you to think about where your money goes. Support brands that innovate, that treat their employees with respect, and that care about their customers. Let's hold these so-called ""luxury"" brands accountable for living in the past. #LuxuryFragrance #CarolinaHerrera #PacoRabanne #JeanPaulGaultier #Accountability #ShopSmall #SupportIndieBrands

@liesecarey9494,"In trying to illuminate moral clarity you are ironically muddying the waters. Murder is evil because God said that murder is evil. All you are doing by denying the evil of the medical and insurance industries is giving power to those who would use the great pain people suffer at the hands of those industries to do exactly what you do not want them to do. I can be happy for you if the sorrowa and pains you've had to suffer have been relatively light. But you seriously need to stop demeaning the level of pain that other people are in and the fact that they know to their bones that Satan is having a heydey with those industries and giving many of us constant temptation. We live in a fallen world and God teaches us to do good regardless. Quit denying the evil that is besetting us. 
That man who was killed may have love duia job or may have hated it. Heay have been psycho evil or he may have just been wildly delusionally able to justify being involved in that terrible industry. The odds that he may have been just a re really good guy doing good in the world and not involved in things that no human should be involved in (in God's eyes) within his daily work life is just insanely small. His murder was wrong because murder is wrong. And the terrors and traumas some of us constantly face make us vulnerable to those people who will prey on us and all the suffering for political gain. You need to quit moralizing in such wrong ways and just admit that we live in a fallen world. I have no doubt that you understand that and feel the significance of it to some degree. Feel free to actually do something about the evils surrounding and engulfing medicine and insurance if you can whilst quitting this pretense that it's all ok and the people who run the psychopathic funny farm are all just good and never evil.",0,2024-12-10T23:36:22Z,2024-12-10T23:36:22Z

@robertbasile4289,"Hi Ben, I completely agree with your point: violence is never a solution, nor does it change the system. However, I wanted to address your comments on psilocybin. While I understand your concerns about drugs, I believe it‚Äôs important to note that psilocybin isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúuntested‚Äù or ‚Äúunproven‚Äù as it might seem.

The reason research on psychedelics took so long to emerge was due to the Controlled Substances Act of the 1970s, which classified them as Schedule I substances, essentially halting scientific studies for decades. That said, recent research has shown incredible promise. For example, a Johns Hopkins study found that 80% of smokers who underwent psilocybin therapy quit smoking within a year‚Äîan unprecedented success rate.

I know you‚Äôre a strong supporter of our troops, and I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning the promising results psilocybin has shown in treating PTSD through guided therapy. Many veterans who have struggled to find relief are experiencing hope and healing through this approach, often referred to as ‚Äúmushroom therapy.‚Äù

Of course, psychedelics are not for everyone‚Äîthey can be dangerous for individuals with a predisposition to mental illness or when used improperly. But I believe calling them ‚Äúuntested‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fully capture the growing body of evidence supporting their potential medical applications.

I‚Äôm a big fan of your show, and I truly appreciate the thoughtful discussions you bring to the table. I just wanted to share this perspective, as it might not be something you‚Äôve had the chance to explore in detail.",1,2024-12-10T23:08:57Z,2024-12-10T23:08:57Z

He chose surgery and they informed him of his options, the NHS surgeon, who was considered one of the best in the country, or he could go private. He chose the public option. They carried out the procedure for free using the DaVinci robotic system and he is now fine and well, and the first test results show that everything is ok. This certainly doesn't sound like a disaster to me. Now of course the British NHS has issues, like bureaucracy and overspending sometimes in non medical necessities, but you used a very specific argument to attack it. Life expectancy. There surely must be better arguments than this to defend the US system  than this considering that the UK has a life expectancy almost 5 years longer that the USA. As I mentioned, a nationalized system is not perfect but I can think of at least one example of a very bad public health service that has actually improved PRIVATE healthcare. In my country (Greece) the NHS is in absolute shambles. There is no serious primary healthcare, so you usually go straight to the hospital. There is corruption, the staff work long hours for little pay(that plays a big role in quality), hospital governors and health district directors are political appointments(usualy failed electoral canditates of the ruling party) and there are supply issues in the countryside. Don't get me wrong, the people there do a great job and if you go to a Greek hospital you are in good hands the vast majority of the time, but there is no doupt that the system is stuck in the 80s. But, remember the DaVinci robotic surgery I mentioned in the UK? You can have that in Greece to in private hospitals(the NHS does not have this robot yet). A friend of mine had intestinal surgery and he utilizes private insurance. His plan is around 750‚Ç¨(62.5‚Ç¨ a month, ie around 66$) and the insurance company covered all the costs(apart from the transportation to the city where the hospital was located). Why would they do that? Because they know that you don't really need them. You can always go to your local hospital and eventually someone will treat you. So they have to raise quality of service and keep the prices down. If you think about it, at least in this case, the public option is actually good for the free market. It improves private enterprise by giving a minimum standard against which it has to compete. It is surprising to me that in the US this is a left - right issue. In Europe you will be hardpressed to find a right winger who is against public healthcare, even the more economic libertarian ones. In fact the first form of public health coverage was instituted by Otto von Bismark  when he was Chancelor of Germany. You can hardly call him a leftist. I can only attribute this fierce defence of the current model to lobbying rather than ideology. Of course i am not saying that Americans should immediately create an NHS, i do not know all the nouances(how many doctors there are, costs etc) to have an opinion about that. But calling having a public option a proven disaster requires a lot of mental gymnastics and is simply untrue. Sorry for the long text.

For instance: your diabetic medicine is prescribed to correct your A1C.  Include how other prescriptions did not correct your A1C. Include your release of information so the doctors working for the insurance company can see medical rationale. When you file your Appeal with the insurance company be sure to ask for an override so you can fill your prescriptions as Dispense as Written without the ancillary fees until the Appeal is decided.

It would have been so much easier to explain how the laws and regulations of the system actually force insurance companies to do seemingly horrible acts, out of the simple fact that every ethical alternative to these psychopathic practices has been effectively outlawed by the government, and then given a list of laws and regulations that obviously negatively affect healthcare (there are many) that would reasonably support such argument.

We have a lot of private services here.  Many of our healthcare services have been deregulated over the years.  These costs are pushed to group benefit insurers and patients.

I don't think these are concerns that have ever troubled Shapiro but his lack of sympathy for the concerns of normal people seem uncaring.

Stop paying for any medical insurance from here on forward, save your money and if you need any medical procedure done, go down to Mexico or Columbia and pay out-of-pocket there. If you think about it, you‚Äôre actually saving money because you will only be paying for medical expenses when you actually need them and not every single month when you‚Äôre not even using it. The amount of money that you pay out-of-pocket in Mexico or in Columbia will be a fraction of what you would pay up here in the states. Because you‚Äôre not paying out every single month, and only when you need it, you will actually be saving more money that way while simultaneously getting the healthcare you actually need and deserve. You‚Äôre gonna be paying regardless. Might as well pay for legitimate care and procedures. And in the event of dire circumstances and dire emergencies, emergency medical rooms cannot turn you away just because you don‚Äôt have insurance. And sure, that emergency visit will be pricey if you don‚Äôt qualify for emergency Medi-Cal, but at least it will be cheaper than paying month after month after month on a premium that you‚Äôre not using every single month. I‚Äôve had very expensive premiums, and I‚Äôve had Medi-Cal insurance and honestly, the treatment is pretty much the same. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have it at all anymore. I‚Äôd rather save my money and use it when and where it counts.

If more and more people did this, we would essentially be boycotting and bankrupting these insurance companies that we‚Äôre so dissatisfied with, and they will eventually be begging for customers to come back to them. But we will only return to them if and when they make the necessary changes that we are clamoring for. Until then we will not line their pockets and they can go suck a fat c*ck. But murder is not the answer. Violence only begets violence.",1,2024-12-10T21:15:50Z,2024-12-10T21:15:50Z

I've had clearly-reasonable treatments denied or greatly delayed, including by UHC, and their requirements forced me through years of unnecessary illness.  On the other hand, every kind of insurer - state or not - has to push back against payments in favor of less expensive options.  My wife is a prescriber, and the extent to which insurers push back is flatly unreasonable, but I don't see a redress which doesn't involve hundreds of thousands - or millions - of reasonable and necessary procedures being denied or delayed.

For the areas with which I'm familiar, UHC also provides higher reimbursement rates than many of their competitors, meaning a greater acceptance of the program by providers.  That might correlate with the denial rate.  Just a thought.",3,2024-12-10T21:04:54Z,2024-12-10T21:04:54Z

When I was at Kaiser, which I know some people don't like, I could still go in for a routine checkup and pay maybe a $10 copay and that was about it.  Recently, I had a relatively brief check-in with United healthcare just to establish a primary care provider, and even with insurance I was surprised that I was billed about $400.  I think most of that was just the time spent with a doctor but again this is all just routine like taking blood pressure, checking my ears and my breathing and a brief discussion.  There were no procedures, yet somehow I still was billed around $400 with insurance.  I can sympathize with a sense of frustration.  But acting out violently is senseless.",0,2024-12-10T20:58:55Z,2024-12-10T20:58:55Z

They did try to get me on psych meds... claiming they will help treat the cronic pain. Nope....not an option for me! Too dangerous playing with those drugs! Now, I take Adderall...which has helped immensely. Cronic pain just wears you out. Adderall helps me get through the day with minimal side effects.

to pretend that violence like this has no effect on the system as a whole is also absolutely untrue. companies have already changed cruel policy like not covering anesthetics for surgeries in the wake of this. threat of the law or threat of violence have always been effective means of change, whether thats right or wrong is a different debate.

@joellewis6086,"How much clearer could Ben be?

Last year, he contrasted the choice to move himself and his family out of California, which is hardly a model of ethical governance, to the actions of the shooter. Here he acknowledges, and does not oppose, the fact that many people, including 'several' doctors that he knows personally, agree that pharmaceutical companies such as the one that this CEO headed, rip patients off. He is *not* saying that anger directed toward the health care is not valid.

Nor, btw, is he implying that Canada and Britain's systems are the only alternative to a purely private model. Is this segment supposed to be a survey and analysis of every type system currently employed around the world The Young America's Foundation YouTube channel has a video of Ben's response during one of his college q&a's in which he singles out Sweden's system as the best functioning for of 'socialized' healthcare, and also says that a movement of our system in _either_ direction would be an improvement over our current system.

Ben's two points are very simple: 1. That healthcare in this country is broken, and the system many on the left would like us to move to, exemplified by Canada and Britain, have massive problems compared to an entirely approach; and more importantly 2) _That no matter the policy or character of the victim_ the actions of his murderer were evil, his motives dehumanizing, and any mitigation of his actions on the basis of the character of the victim or the industry which he belongs is not only evil, but degrades the dignity of human life( including that of his family and loved ones) in a way that is *exactly* in line with the philosophy of the radical left.

And you know what? Ben's right?

Those of you responding to Ben's take with *well, of course people are angry!* should take another look at the killer's Amazon review of the Unibomber's journal. It almost mirrors the course of the killer's own journey, beginning with sentiments that we/you can certainly find understandable, and ending with a wholesale rejection of peaceful protest, and a defense of violence as the only viable option to effect change. Ben is critical of the ending to that review; you are getting upset because you/we identify with the beginning.

There should be no medical insurance companies or government subsidies for healthcare, no Medicare. Cost would be more competitive and go down. Less overhead or fighting with insurance companies to pay. Every person should be allowed to have their own interest earning health savings  acct, tax free, without forcing health  insurance coverage. People would be more conservative with healthcare visits.

@Jayskiallthewayski,"Again, I don't condone murder, I think most of us with a clear head don't, however, just calling it evil is too easy. When you look at a society and why things happen over there, let's say Iraq after they were given the American gift of ""freedom"" or any country that has certain things going on because of it's situation then simply calling it evil is not good enough. If you treat your citizens like shit, shitty things will happen. You're a smart guy, Ben and I'm on board for most of the things you have to say but for instance the Unabomber had some pretty important wise things to say about society. What he did with it was completely wrong, yes, 100%, but it wasn't just evil and that's it. There's society, his mental health, how he was treated, etc etc etc. Same with this guy. He did a horrible thing yes, but he also has a point. So how did we get to that point? And do we do with it? Will you ever get rid of ""evil"" all together? No, probably not but you sure af can bring the numbers down. You have the murder rate of a third world country so you've got some serious problems. And if you're someone that's in a high position of a company that chooses profit over the well being over it's *cough* customers and people die while you make 10 million a year than someone could snap and say ""No more"". That's not just evil, it's cause and effect. You guys always call the U.S. the greatest country on earth and in some ways it is but in other ways it's a sewer. And bad things happen in a sewer. And to be a great country you have to look at these issues, the reasons and change them or they will happen again and again. This guy won't be the last. America has a real problem so people get killed who shouldn't get killed. And simply saying ""Ah well, that's just evil"" is no answer.",11,2024-12-10T20:09:23Z,2024-12-10T20:09:23Z

@rpnvg,"This isn‚Äôt a left vs right issue. I live in an extremely conservative area and I haven‚Äôt heard a single person bash Luigi. Especially among healthcare staff. I have had neonatologists forced to write United/BCBS because they denied a 24 week neonate‚Äôs care in relation to having simple genetic testing. We were testing the baby for possible underlying genetic problems.

I have had pediatric intensivists forced to write letters to insurance companies because they declined any coverage when a 12 year old boy with severe bilateral pneumonia and sepsis was placed on ECMO. ECMO is a procedure when the body‚Äôs blood is ran through an external machine that acts as the body‚Äôs heart & lungs ‚Äî providing oxygen and removing CO2. Without ECMO, he would have died. He recovered but insurance still refused to cover any portion of the  costs.

I have seen insurance companies decline coverage for a 5 year old with severe RSV/entero-rhino/Flu-B, who required more than a standard ventilator. He needed HFOV (high frequency oscillator ventilation) because his PIP‚Äôs were so high, that it was going to cause damage to his alveoli. Without HFOV, he would have died. They declined it, citing he should have just remained on the standard ventilator. Keep in mind his oxygen would *nosedive* on the standard vent and his CO2 would skyrocket, leading to other adverse metabolic changes in the body.


These greedy bastards screw literally everyone over. Everyone. Even literal babies and children. You pay them to get screwed over. It is no wonder that after doing this to millions of people that someone finally had enough. I understand wanting to prevent wasteful spending ‚Äî but too often have I seen insurance companies deny people basic lifesaving measures. Resulting in people having their entire lives ruined by medical debt.

I don‚Äôt condone murder. But to act surprised or blame political enemies is very disingenuous. The left legacy media is painting him as a right wing murderer.

@Muskiehunter4841,"I see this so much. If you have a lumbar fusion, it causes a transfer syndrome to your SI joints. Often times surgeons just look at the MRI and never even test a person‚Äòs SI joints with a diagnostic injection to see if that‚Äôs the problem. Then they undergo a lumbar fusion which transfers all the stress to their SI joints And it causes severe pain. Young people get stuck with this because they just wanna go in and see a surgeon and have it fixed. The discussion about how long-term most fusions fail when done for discogenic, low back pain, and the possible transfer syndromes to the SI joints. Those discussions usually are not had with the patient. Combine that with a young person‚Äôs frontal lobe under development, particularly in males, which lead you to be more impulsive and not look for your long-term welfare results and spinal fusion surgery. Most ethical spine surgeons do not offer lumbar fusion surgery for young people if it‚Äôs coming from the disc, unless you have a condition like instabilityor sometimes a fractured back. The only fix for SI joint pain if it‚Äôs due to a transfer syndrome is an SI joint fusion which is not consistently efficacious, although outcomes have improved in the last few years.",11,2024-12-10T19:20:17Z,2024-12-10T19:20:17Z

@QuantumlyImmortal,Psychedelics do have a positive benefit when studied properly and used in a controlled manner. Even Elon Musk uses prescribed ketamine and he's very successful. I agree with almost everything you say but I'm a strong believer that these things need to be researched to be given to people that don't have any other options to treat their PTSD and things like this that no other treatments help. In particular DMT is completely safe for you if your at least 25. They should not be made legal. But they should be studied and prescribed or given treatment in a controlled environment. Joe Rogan has never pushed for full on legalization. Only that there are very specific ones that have been shown to be be safe and non addictive that should be allowed to be studied and following that research to be allowed be used for therapy purposes only,1,2024-12-10T18:14:56Z,2024-12-10T18:14:56Z

@earldelsanto,"Gueto what da maters wit you . Giving us Italian Americans a bad look dude. Shooting the man in the back. In the Old West that would have branded you a coward for the short time you would have left here on earth among the living. 26 years old you have thrown your life away . No more breathing deep on a chilly morning.no more MacDonald's or grand mas Italian spaghetti üçù. No more laughing no more woman to chase no no nothing. You are gonna spend 40 or 50 or more miserable years in a state prison where men are yelling and screaming all hours of the night. 
Go ahead enjoy your 15 minutes of fame but you will soon be so alone so forgotten. You did this to yourself by shooting a human being in his back in the early dawn hours on the city streets. At least he never knew what hit him. You have a lifetime to remember. You fool.",0,2024-12-10T17:40:30Z,2024-12-10T17:40:30Z
