@10_Percent_For_The_Big_Guy,"While I agree that anyone who has committed a crime should be held accountable (although I think years locked away in a dungeon without the possibility of parole or even visitors is a bit harsh for the people who were LET IN and didn't start any fires or kill anyone), I have to say that I completely disagree with you about a couple things. 
1. Trump did say to PEACEFULLY protest, and those that didn't shouldn't be on him. 
2. And this is my biggest issue with what you had said, Jan 6th was NOT the worst thing to happen to America since 9/11. To say that it was, is being willfully ignorant or disingenuous. You know what is worse than a few broken windows and (supposedly) a dozen cops injured or killed? Try cities burning, countless windows broken, businesses looted, innocent people's livelihoods destroyed, causing a BILLION dollars in damage, not to mention, dozen(S) of citizens killed, over A THOUSAND cops killed or injured, and children who are now left without mothers or fathers. Call me crazy, but that is WAY worse than Jan. 6th, when nobody was ACTUALLY killed as a direct result of the riot or protest or whatever, with the exception of one unarmed woman protestor, who was also a veteran. Like I said, I agree that any rioters who committed a crime should be punished for it. But that also applies to all the rioters who committed crimes during the supposedly ""peaceful protests"". You can't have it both ways. The law only works if it is applied equally. Regardless of your political affiliation. And we both know which party is NEVER held accountable for ANY of their actions. Time and time again. And no, it's not the right...
Furthermore, if Jan 6th is a riot, then the ACTUAL riots from BLM and Anqueefa, should no longer be called ""mostly peaceful protests"". It's absolutely hypocritical and ludicrous.",0,2022-08-21T05:30:03Z,2022-08-21T05:30:03Z

Why yes Ben, I (and you) have seen something like this.

When a bunch of Anti-Kavanaugh protesters showed up banging on the doors of the Supreme Court.
When a bunch of insane leftists tried to cement a police precinct with people inside shut and light it on fire. 
When leftists rioted for months and months and months burned down private and federal property and caused the uncountable deaths of law enforcement and private citizens.
When Maxine Waters told her followers to ""form a crowd"" and ""push back on them"" wherever they found Republican leaders. 

It isn't what-about-ism when we are not shocked over a single rightwing riot after hundreds of leftists ones going on countrywide for months.

@sl-rt5kv,"Contrary to what Shapiro claims, there is nothing wrong, per se, with ""raising the temperature"" of people concerning issues of the day.  The problem with Trump was different.  He encouraged his Vice President and members of Congress to overturn an election that had been decided by the States.  If Congress and the Pence acted in this way or if the military had staged a coup on his behalf, there is every reason to believe Trump would have supported those actions.  Trump's calling people to Washington, and asking them march on the Capitol was obviously intended to pressure Congress and Pence to do Trump's biding.  Irrespective of whether Trump's actions were against the law, they constituted a threat to Democracy.

@keithpartridge3293,"Thank you, Ben, for doing this episode.  We need more conservatives in the media and in congress to acknowledge the fact that the election wasn't rigged and stolen.  While I understand and accept your rational for saying that Donald Trump isn't responsible for the violence that occurred at the capitol, I disagree to an extent.  While he might not be solely responsible, this never would have happened if he hadn't started and continued perpetuating the lie about the election being fraudulent.  To use the age-old, overused example, if he yelled ""fire"" in a packed theatre where there was no fire, and people got trampled to death as they tried to escape, would he not bear some responsibility?  In this case, Trump started yelling fire before election day, on election day, and every day after the election.  He still hasn't stopped yelling fire and probably never will.  Donald Trump started this and he can end it, but he refuses to.  Therefore, I hold him responsible to a large extent.  Until we all start holding our elected officials responsible for telling us the truth, and hold them accountable for their lies, we'll never get beyond the partisan politics that are destroying our country.  This goes for both sides, Democrats and Republicans.  As citizens, we need to be able to look at issues honestly and objectively, based on knowing the truth and the facts, and then do what's best for the country as a whole, not just do what benefits a particular political party.

@Julesybabes70,"'Roundly condemned by conservatives'.  
So Trump organises a rally 1.6miles from the Capitol, invites people to attend because 'its going to be wild', raises the temperature by encouraging people to 'fight' 20 or so times during his speech, brings his entourage, some of whom suggest a contest should be decided by 'mortal combat' and that the election will be conceded 'over my dead body', then encourages them to march on the Capitol, whilst simultaneously refusing to send in the national guard when things got out of hand.  Its not direct instruction, probably insufficient to succeed in a criminal court, but can the USA and conservative members of the Senate really believe the President who instigated and encouraged this, should be allowed to retain any right to hold a position of such authority?",1,2021-01-17T13:37:58Z,2021-01-17T13:37:58Z
@AdamsBrew78,"I think Ben Shapiro is a reasonable human being. I believe he’s empirically wrong about many things, particularly many of his takes on the latter half of this video — the first half, he hit the nail on the head. I think you can be wrong about a lot of things in life and still be a decent person  — and many on the left would disagree and consider him indecent—which I think is unfair.  To me, decency is having principals and standing by them, and having the courage to stand up for them, even when doing so will be unpopular and incite backlash. 

Trying to stay truthful in such a polarized, conflicted, chaotic and confusing world, is not an easy task—especially when dishonesty is politically weaponized and rewarded by so many dishonorable people.

 I've been a Democrat my whole life as is my wife.  Our beliefs are progressive and socially liberal.  We believe regulations are in place to protect us from harm caused by corporate greed.   We're financially pretty well off, but like most working lower-middle-class Americans we're one tragedy away from financial ruin.  Social programs are in place to help you get back on your feet so you can eventually continue to be a healthy, law-abiding, productive member of society.  I hate it when the system is abused.  All of us who don't abuse the system do.
My wife and I live our lives pretty conservatively. We work hard, save, and invest.  We live comfortably within our means.  I own guns.  I like them and practice with them regularly.  I think it's a good idea to know how to safely handle a firearm.
I'm an old guy though.  I saw those people who stormed the Capitol.  They're mostly young, fit, angry, aggressive white guys.  I could tell by the way they conducted themselves a lot of them had military/police training.  If a civil war breaks out, guys like us can't go up against that.
I think it's crazy that the inauguration isn't going to be held in a bunker.  Who's to say that a lot of these guardsmen and cops aren't going to go rogue and try something crazy.

@mak.ak.uk.,"The problem with Trump is that he never disavowed or condemned them in his first speech after the event. Not a single word of condemnation or demand for their arrest. Instead he offered a polite request for his supporters to go home, a shower of love/praise, reinforcement of their claims/accusations and tons of moral justification.

Don't bother referring to the subsequent speech he made days after, condemning the event. That was clearly scripted and written by someone else. I trust his first speech, delivered honestly and naturally. Here is a transcript:

*_""I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us._*_ It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side, but you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. It’s a very tough period of time._

*_There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election,_*_ but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home._

*_We love you. You’re very special._*_ You’ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home at peace.""_",0,2021-01-15T16:26:28Z,2021-01-15T16:26:28Z

Considering objective facts such as the almost impossibility of a massive voter fraud affecting millions of votes being successfully pulled off with not a shred of evidence is too much work for the 'average' brain. The brain, like water, is hard wired to follow the path of least resistance. It 'jumps to conclusions' when it can do so.

We had Biden getting statistically impossible 90 degree jumps in his votes at 3 in the morning. We had video evidence of votes being counted and pulled out in secret. The election was forcibly non-transparent which means it was invalid by default. You don't need to prove wrongdoing if you aren't allowed to monitor the election in the first place. We had Trump improve by EVERY single demographic, including blacks and muslims, EXCEPT white men (Come on people wake up).
You will never win another election again. They cheated and they cheated in broad daylight. On top of all that, they rubbed your noses in it and mocked you and goaded you.

Scott Adams was right when he said conservatives will be hunted in the streets just like that one Trump supporter that was executed on the street.

Sure, but the vast majority of conservatives voted for Trump,  elected him, defended him, and supported him throughout his term, and used silly statements like ""you can't take what he says literally"", ""that's just Trump hyperbole"" to dismiss repeated warnings about the potential results of the combination of Trump's abysmal character, his autocratic desires, his dog whistling violence and his complete lack of respect for the rule of law.

@mmark300,"Guess who has the BEST arguments against Ben Shapiro's free speech arguments in this latter part of this video - that's right, Ben Shapiro in the beginning part of this video!  Ben Shapiro before should probably watch Ben Shapiro later to hear the best arguments as to why we can no longer afford to propagate the messages that created The Worst Day in American Political History.  Ben's solution is that we need to condemn the riots, violence, etc.  What do we do when our own president is the one creating these riots and violence through his lies?  What do we do when our own gov't (republicans) won't do anything to stop him?  Sadly, corporations had to step in and take charge, as if they didn't already have enough power.
I'm sorry, we didn't want social media to keep up messages to hunt down our VP, so why would we want them to keep the lies that continued to 'heat the water' that lead to the rioters wanting to hunt down the VP?  Should social media have removed these types of messages for summer riots?  Of course.  But they also should have been removing Trump's riot-inciting tweets for weeks now.  I think only after this point in time and moving forward, where they are actually enforcing their terms, can they be fairly called out for hypocrisy.

@mmark300,Congressmen like Mitch McConnell coming in at the 13th hour to condemn Trump's rhetoric and the insurrection it caused is complete BS.  THIS is why the left is calling out everyone who has been complicit in what has been leading up to this insurrection for the last 4 years and especially since the election.  And pointing to what Mitch said this ONE time AFTER the insurrection is even worse.  It was up to the REPUBLICANS to do something about Trump BEFORE the insurrection - no one else could do it.

@mmark300,A couple good arguments for bringing race into this - would the capitol police have let some non-white BLM protestors into the capitol? (This appears to have occurred near one entrance).  Would any capitol police have taken selfies or chit-chatted with non-white BLM protestors?  I'm not sure we even have to use the word 'would' because we never saw any of that type of behavior during the summer protests.

@joeydrakeward4077,"Ben Shapiro is pretty consistent with his views, whether he’s on his own show, the news, a live debate of the Joe Rogan experience. I agree with 90% of what he says. Riots are bad. Leaders words fuel the temperature of these riots, so their not responsible but they do have influence. All fair. My issue with Ben is, you can’t go running to Statistics for every argument. My question is, does Ben Shapiro believe racism exists? In almost every video Ive watch of his, the argument of racism is almost dismissed and told because of Statistics, there can be no case to be made for racist motivation. I watched Ben on the Joe Rogan show respond to the question, if he was the king of the world that he would simply put more cops in bad neighborhoods and that if you simple put positive male Role models in these kids lives, all problems are solved. It was just truly spoken by a man who knows nothing about the United States ghettoes and how those people live their lives everyday. I’m a black man. I was called N*gger and an aboriginal at a “white bar” by someone I thought was a friend just weeks before Covid shutdown the world and I did absolutely nothing to provoke this man. The man just got too comfortable and it was clear how he viewed me. So you have to look at everything case by case and not by the numbers because crazy and simple minded is pretty random.

@frankrigelwoodsr.1184,"I understand what you're saying, but don't you think that there's enough questions about the legitimacy of the election to warrant an investigation? There's enough about the dominion voting machines alone to warrant an investigation. However, all those questions will never be answered now. 
All their of the actions of the people running the polling locations( which apparently are all democrats or leftist) will never looked into.
Why was the counting stopped, poll watchers and press sent home, then the counting begins again?
Why was a there a broken water main reported that cause counting to have to be stopped, only to find out that it was only a toilet that broke a seal, so the counting continued once everyone was gone.
Why did a voting machine that was not supposed to be connected to the internet, shut down for a download?
And what's the common denominator with all these events? 
Biden surged ahead.
Don't you think at least some of these deserve being looked into?
But because the people who was trying to answer these questions were blocked either by the states or courts, non of this matters.
Why, because of the riots that would have happened? 

But then again your probably going to say that the C-19 was caused because people in China eats bats, even though they've been doing so for.....ever.
And that the virus just happened to get introduced during an election year?
Then every democratic governors run ruff shod in their states destroying the greatest economy in the world along with the history of this country, and once we learned that it actually has over a 99% survival rate nothing changes. 
And you can go to preselected stores, or gather in huge crowds to protest and riots, but mail in voting is all about saving lives.
Do you think nothing strange about antifa and blm taking over protests and turning them into riots in democrat controlled cities, that has radical left AGs, (most of which  soros funded theircampaign)
across the country, injuring and killing people, causing billions of dollars of damage to personal property, all at the same time, and stopping all at the same time like on que? 
Wonder how many arrested rioters actually went to court?
 I know they were being released without bail, also charges were either reduced to misdemeanors or dropped.
And why hasn't the FBI been able to find any central figure or command? Guess the explanation that antifa is just people who spontaneously come together to fight fascism is correct.
No funding, no logistics, no communications, no organizational structure. So no one in government enforcement agencies, on the state or federal level can do anything about them. 
Guess that's why the media nor any democrat will say anything negative about them.they're all just peaceful protesters.

So nothing with the election or events during 2020, is going to be investigated. 
No court would at least allow it to be looked into. 
And you say that what happened at the capital was the worst thing ever.
Think about it for a moment, how many conservative gatherings has gone violent? With hundreds of thousands of conservatives there, why did only a small number stormed the capital? 
I listened to an interview of one of the people that made it into the chamber, he said that once in, someone took a bull horn and lead them in prayer.
That doesn't sound like they were trying to over throw the government.
It'll be interesting if any of the people who was amongst the ""rioters"" had any connection to antifa. But guess that also won't be investigated, or at least reported.

You say that how it was handled was against the constitution, do you believe the democrats are going to follow the constitution? 
However, if they don't, who's going to say anything?

He has done work they could only have dreamed of, work weakening America and democracies worldwide no foreign intelligence operation could have hoped for in their wildest dreams.

@BigSleepyOx,"So Shapiro, yet again, cannot find it within him to condemn actions of trump or his supports, without all sort of equivocation and apologetics.   And you know what, Ben?  Some of what has happened is on you, because you KNEW that trump was a piece of shit.  Some of the others may have been too dimwitted to know that, but you knew it.  You said as much.  Yet you enabled his bullshit for 5 years by always equivocating when criticizing him.  And you continue to do it even now.

You didn't even unequivocally condemn trump's childish behavior since the election.  You made jokes and whatnot.  You didn't condemn him pushing the lame election fraud conspiracy theories, or getting Texas to sue other states, or 17 states signing up for that lame lawsuit (prompting 20 states to join on the other side).  And all the ""Kraken"" nonsense from Sidney Powell.  All of it that got people stoked up in a rage.  You never condemned it unequivocally, or took it as a serious threat to the country.  You did your psuedo-intellectual schtick to make money off it, and fed into the bs instead.

You're not as bad as the likes of Tucker Carlson, Hannity, Limbaugh, or Dobbs, who worship the toilet that trump craps in.  But you enabled this for 5 years, and it culminated in the events we saw and are seeing (as more footage, and worse, footage continues to be released).",0,2021-01-11T15:41:46Z,2021-01-11T15:41:46Z

It depends on belief in the fair, impartial and accurate results of an election. The crises is one of confidence. There is an old adage that ""justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done"". Belief is probably the most important issue. You can't have a functioning democracy when at least 39% think it is rigged. The only issue that really needs to be addressed is how to restore confidence in the fairness of the system.

I think it’s good for the US to get another president no matter the political party, a president that hopefully tries to bring the Americans together rather than splitting them. The same goes for the new majorities in the house and senate. It’s never a good thing to have one party to have all the power but unfortunately, it seems to be the only way to get out of the terrible state the country is in.

@andrewjones4568,Republican voters are not responsible for the attack on the Capitol Building. They have been lied to and whipped in to a frenzy by Trump and some right wing media. These conservative media which have included yourself at times historically and Republican politicians who have enabled Trump through not calling out his continuous attacks on democracy and the election.,3,2021-01-11T10:34:17Z,2021-01-11T10:34:17Z
@callummartin4697,"I agree with ben very strongly.
The moment the people damaged property it turns into riots, unfortunately what doesn't help was the double standards portrayed by the media with the BLM ""protests""

Now this whole impeachment of trump just comes across as the democrats scoring points.

@cynthiariddle7310,"Ben, ultimately and sadly lives were lost at the Capital, the main focus as a Country, right or wrong,  would be to mourn the lives lost, no matter what our Political views are on this touchy subject.  I am greatly saddened  with all of my aging heart, especially for all the abundance of peaceful Protestors who showed up to show their support for their Country, who did not have ill intentions in their hearts. I STAND PROUDLY with the HONEST, educated, hard working back bones who unfortunately now live in a spineless back-stabbing Nation. I wish I could have joined the peaceful marchers, but I could not be there due to health reasons.  Sadly the fellow men and women who were peaceful protestors, the speeches, the voices of so many, unfortunately will be erased from our History books and anyone who was there to Support the President, or our Country will be labeled as radicals, racist, and terrorist. Many of us Americans feel that we were betrayed by both political parties,  in the days that followed this tragedy. Many of us already feel we are at ""war"" with the media, and have been at War, true war is not pretty, it is not fashionable,  and it ""SHOULD NOT"" (edited), include ""selfies"" or photo opts with celebrities'!  Many of us hard working Americans feel our Rights have already been taken from us, that our voices have been silenced whereas half truths continue to be replaced with Socialist ideology.  I have never been a ""T"" supporter, but like many I am a supporter of his policies. But how dare anyone say that I and many other's are un-American, or racist because we chose to support a legally sworn in President? That is one of our biggest Rights, to have the RIGHT to chose who we vote for, who we want to represent we as the People. No one should be allowed to issue death threats, but now many who were present at ""T"" speech will be hunted like animals, and that is un-American, and unacceptable! NO ONE has stood up for the PEACEFUL protestors! No one has stood to call out violence for what it is, on BOTH political sides! 
But in regards to what happened at the Capital, when you gather that many like-minded angry Americans who already feel like their freedoms and rights have been infringed or many who lost their jobs due to their business's being shut down, meanwhile our Government turned a blinds eye to the masses in the streets of protestors,  and then the fall out when so many of us saw with our own eyes the irregularities in fairness in the media, well then Ben, I have to say,  the tipping point for many,  the rage, the anger, the human frustration was bound to rare it's ugly head at some point because some of us American's never intended to be ""controlled"" or regulated, or muted against our will. Like many have stated, these have been unprecedented times. but not because of the events that unfolded at our Capital, but because of the unnecessary Nationwide SHUTS DOWNS. For many Americans, the worst days in history would be to note the 100 year old business that went out of business, as well as many other hard working people who watched their business die, or be looted by criminal protestors!  For many the worst days in our history were having to watch historical monuments and statues defaced and torn down, without criminal consequence. For many the worst days were having to watch a loved one die from the monitor of computer screen,  while protestors continued to burn and loot, and dance in the city streets! In my case it was having to watch my Aunts funeral from a computer screen, not being allowed to be present for her funeral, but meanwhile hundreds, maybe thousands of people gathered and  showed up to pay their respects to George Floyds funeral!  I could go on forever with ""many of the worst"" days but my comment is becoming one bad run on sentence after another. My POINT is that  you can only poke a bee hive but so long before you get stung. Even though your thoughts were well presented,  well received, both educative, and informative, I an still compelled with all due respect,  to call you out on one of your statements that I vehemently disagree with and with that let me explain why. Ben, there are not many American's left that properly memorialize what happened on 9-11, and many like yourself were still ""wet behind the ears"" or not even born yet on the day that should NEVER be forgotten!  I being a few of those Americans who will never forget, experienced,  and truly remember the horrors that unfolded on that day. The sheer mention of ""9-11"" brings back a flood of emotions, but also how proud I was to stand UNITED with so many fellow Americans who were ready to FIGHT and die alongside me that day to protect one another, TO PROTECT all that we value! The first responders, the brave men and women in blue, and tragically  many of the survivors who became ill years later and the horrible  fight that went on for years in court trying to prove that their illness's were a direct result of the dust their lungs had been exposed to in the months that followed the clearing of ground O. The only other time since 9-11 that I began to feel that horrid pit in my stomach just so happened to begin around the time when Antifa, and the tyranny surrounding them that began to take a strong hold of our Country,  in the months that followed the Portland Protest. The nightly murdering of ""Old Glory""  brought me back to the moments when people began plummeting from the towers during the beginning of the tragedy that unfolded during the beginning hours of ""9-11."" Every time I saw a flag that was defiled, molested if you will,  it brought back another flood of memories as anarchists' took to the City streets, threatening the Brave Men and Women in Blue,  many who no doubt would give their lives for our own. The same Men and Women that would stand ready to protect, during a War. The flood of rage coming from Godless children, the hatred that ended only to begin the next night, the next month, and so forth, was a spit on the face to every man and women who had ever served this Country and died holding the values of the Great American Flag. The ripping down of Monuments, the looting, the rioting, the closing down of business's, just to name a few. And now the death threats and shutting of voices to anyone who even mentions support of the ""T"" word. I must say to you Ben, there is no comparison of what happened at the Capital in comparison to what happened on the day of ""9-11."" I will say our Freedom, and our Democracy may die as a result of what happened on that day. I must say the ""WORST DAYS in Modern American Political History"" began the days and months of last year that we allowed one false narrative after another bad narrative to be presented, while completely eradicating, misconstruing, and silencing the voices of the opposition. I was not present for the Protest in D.C, , and  I do not know why a few protestors decided to storm the Capital, only I imagine it was to make a statement. I do not know what their plan was, but I will NEVER compare their anger with the efforts from the un-American terrorist responsible for all the lives lost and the horror that ensued ""9-11."" There will NEVER be a comparison, how could you in good conscious and faith ever begin to compare the two to one another? How dare you compare what happened during the dark days of ""9-11"" and all the trauma it held for so many Americans, to the trauma that has ensued the current tragedy? Should you chose to apologize for  your statement, I will eagerly except your apology. Should I be in wrongful judgement, I apologize in advance, but non-the-less, I desired to speak for the voices that are no longer alive and present to defend themselves from your unnecessary comparison.  Some of those hot-headed protestors that you saw storming the barricade no doubt, I am almost 100% certain would give their life in a heartbeat to protect the Liberty for ALL Americans.  Again, I respect you Ben, and thank-you for your commentary on this painful day in our History. May there be healing, may Justice prevail, may there be light at the end of the tunnel and protect the Constitution of the United States that so many American's have died in our past fighting to preserve and protect!",1,2021-01-11T10:05:47Z,2021-01-11T10:23:13Z

@michelem7986,"President Trump's comments about his great disappointment in the justices relative to the election were just that. Please reconsider.  He isn't disappointed in their failure to deliver some sort of personal quid pro quo, rather his disappointment lies in the contrast between his willingness to face and persevere through tremendous political flack to achieve their confirmations,  and their unwillingness to do the same. By the same I am referring to having the same courage, determination, and resolve to do the right thing.  To do the job for which they were seated - no matter the political opposition or cost. The President has excellent legal counsel, and believes the justices had a duty to hear the case that they rejected.  He and many Americans believe that they shirked their duty. That they placed political considerations and personal expediency before duty. We are a government of, by, and for the people. This is largely achieved through a fair election process. Assuring one vote per lawfully registered voter, and lawfully cast ballot. By protecting the integrity of the vote, counting each lawfully cast ballot, and rejecting all others. To permit voter fraud and tampering with our votes, and to not assure a fair election process thwarts and frustrates the will of the people. It is an egregious mockery. After the fact, presenting the cases of voter fraud and corrupt processes were the remedy. Violence is not the answer, and the President has stood against violence and lawlessness. Surely we must all get involved to insist that the issues and vulnerabilities are examined and resolved at the state level. Never again should any of this take place. At present, we still need to get to the bottom of the ""irregularities,"" and let the facts speak for themselves.. If the votes were indeed tampered with, we must ascertain the lawful election outcomes.",0,2021-01-11T08:54:24Z,2021-01-11T08:54:24Z

There's 25 million protestors for George Floyd across the country - and most off them were peaceful - so many cities had NO violence in huge protests - and of course weren't covered.  'Cause division sells.  So the media PLAYED UP violence by BLM, contrary to your narrative.  The FBI - most of whom supported Trump at least in 2016-  said that Antifa is no threat, I'm sorry Ben, its a Bogeyman.

The Capitol mob were MUCH more violent and dangerous, per-capita.  And were met with LESS resistance.  So YEAH, there is a double standard, Ben, you're right.

@michaelhimes8778,"While it’s obvious that whatever debates in Congress from contesting the electors would not have changed the result, I disagree with Ben that it would, therefore, be a pointless exercise.

Trump just wasn’t worth it- but what about the 75,000,000 citizens who voted for him?  

This would have been an opportunity to at least shed light and frame the issues that the GOP state legislators will need to address if they are to ever win again.  

The Dems executed a strategy and they won. They used every lever of power at their disposal to rewrite and bend the rules with Covid as the pretext and it worked.   C

Now, instead of the call to action being election reform, the narrative is “see, we told you Trump was a tyrant.”  Bring on the struggle sessions.  

To test this, ask yourself if there was footage of GOP workers counting ballots late at night unobserved with statistically anomalous vote dumps coming in for Trump thereafter, would courts and Governor’s have mustered the political will to address it?

@frankpohl4377,"Greets and love from Hamburg in Germany!
I thing that Trump betrayed his supporters by calling them to DC on 06.01.2020. After “his storm troopers” break into the capitol- 
he can say “its all your fault. I am a good men you are bad-
you destroyed everything”
Motive for flipping sides and become an “FBI agent”?
Deal with the Democrats.
The Trump-Plan: His way out of the capitol without losing his face.

1: Trump calls his supporter to come for a last big demonstration. They are like sheep’s they believe “God is calling” so they obey.
2: No “antiterror-security” around the capitol. Anyone how has “to do” with riots or street  terror/ANTIFA/BLM or other social unrest in the west does know that it needs men power-in numbers and strong weapon’s and walls to protect such a big real estate. In the past- Trump send his special forces to Portland to protect the federal buildings. 
Where were they that day? Only poor city police?
How is in charge in times of big demonstrations around the capitol? The city police or the federal police?
There was no security to handle crowd like this and that is-Trumps responsibility. Even no mobile/walls like around the Federal Portland buildings!

3: Trump supporters know all about ANTIFA/FBI infiltrated militias/BLM activist/ fake Trumpers/ and false flag operations.
Even they did know everything about the deep state-
They did not prepare to build a “wall with thousands of men like a stone wall” with their back to the capitol and their eyes to the crowd. There was no Trump-Wall to protect the last miles to victory. Are they so naive or are they stupid or are they spiritual blind, blinded by the real God in heaven? 
Because they trusted “a men” and cursed is everyone that put their trust in men?
Why did they not build a wall around the capitol?

4: Intel- part of the big plot against the Trump-supporters?
Where was the network of INTEL- in and with the Trump supporter or the Trump team?
Where was intel in BREITBART or the many other YT social media content Trump producer?
WHY did not ONE warned the thousand’s to build a wall and stay cool in case of a false flag operation?
That was happened is a first grade kindergarten show- storming with ANTIFA FBI CIA or other how act like Trump fans also with acting police officers. And many real Trump supporters followed them after “they where invited to cross the line?”
Soldiers do know what I mean. There is a line, the war-line.
The no go line. The criminal act.

“The call for the rally”
For me it looks like Trump did plan this.
And his supporters still believe “That Trump has the power to perform the Victory. Or Pence. Or however.” 
And Trump did not order a “line a wall with his soldiers to protect the capitol”. We in Germany in the army did trained such riots in the cold war days. Men beside men.
Shoulder against shoulder. 3 men behind each other with shields and guns.
No chance for riots.
The provocation the call “for help to save Trump” was the trick.
Trump did not save the election in the last 4 years.
He did not change the technical part of the election the vote system. IT from China. Sure. 
4 years of doing nothing to make elections secure.
Only slogan after slogan but slogans are not a goal its only PR or marketing. MAGA or now MASA- make America small again?
Trump and his team had 4 years. Even if they did know about ChinaJoe or the China-power and influence in the Wall street or capitol. They did nothing to prevent future manipulations. 
If the army will not clear the “thing” on 20.01- and the Dems will be the new old power- then Trump was an Agent for the FBI.
And the “Christian-front Trump supporters” still think that they did no wrong.
Do not wonder American evangelical- charismatic- if they world turned against you. You did not protect the center of democracy- no you attacked it and showed the world “how danger Christianity is”
Why did not ONE of the famous “Tv-Prophets” warned about this riots? Because they are part of the Problem the propaganda- for the “King kids” theology.
Christianity will be  the next target and after that the Jews. (My grandmother in germany was a jew in the third rich)",0,2021-01-10T17:00:08Z,2021-01-10T17:00:08Z

The media as a whole colluded against POTUS for at least 4 yrs.  They have treated the right terrible since at least 2008.  Probably earlier.   The fact that since this video was published, many conservative groups, pages and accounts have been removed from social media including Brandon Straka, his Walk away movement page.  Censoring and disabling a sitting President's voice is reprehensible.     You sir are also part of the problem.   When conservatives and the right have been demonized since at least 2008, probably earlier, we're tired of it.   We're tired of it.

@patk3601,"Always find Ben insightful & mostly agree with him. Not so much this time. His assessment that this was an insurrection is off. People have the right to PEACEFULLY protest for any reason, anywhere (legally). Most people at the DC rally were peaceful - mostly singing, praying & talking, which are not the acts of insurrectionists. They were also unarmed. You don't go to an insurrection weaponless. The actions of a few ruined the occasion for all. Do not taint the whole group based on the few.

Just how thorough were Barr's & the courts' investigations considering they interviewed 0 witnesses & conducted no independent audits? I watched 3 state hearings & the witnesses' testimonies were extremely compelling & alarming. Recounts are useless if there are fraudulent ballots in the mix. Recounts won't catch that. Failure to fully investigate voter fraud allegations & irregularities, & unconstitutional activities of several states has long term consequences, extending far beyond the presidential election. Millions of people feel disenfranchised & forever mistrustful of the entire election process. GOP leaders failed dismally in providing oversight & protection of voters by ensuring all voters were treated equally & changes to the syatem were done legally & constitutionally. They didn't bother questioning or protesting unfair, illegal or unconstitutional activities. Add the highly irregular stopping of the vote count at night - you know the rest - loss of chain of custody of ballots, a fake burst pipe =  potential for fraud. Ben finds none of this the least bit problematic or disturbing? Really? If the GOP ever hopes to be re-elected, they'd better develop backbones, investigate & fix this mess. 

I have a many questions surrounding the activities of the few. What did the idiot dressed up as a savage hope to accomplish? He was dressed for a sporting event. His behavior was reprehensible. What did they hope to accomplish by vandalizing & disrespecting the Senate floor? Did they even consider the consequences of their actions & how it would reflect on, as well as affect President Trump, his Supporters & Conservatives as a whole? Did they consider they were playing into the Left's hands - providing them with the perfect weapon? Trump said he called out the National Guard, where were they? Why wasn't there a larger police presence Why weren't there better barriers than bike racks? Why did the police let  people through & into the building? Why was an unarmed woman shot? Did Antifa members infiltrate the rally & instigate the break in & violence? This horrible event must be fully investigated to learn what really happened.

You're darn right. This will have long-term repercussions for Conservatives. This event exceeded anything the Left could desire. This is  about 3 things: revenge, punishment & promoting communism. How? Accuse people of racism even when there's no evidence. Sew discord & use violence to create division along racial or ethnic lines, prevent representation in government at all levels, silence opposing opinions & prevent them  from earning a living.

This might be different if we had proof Trump actually believed the election was stolen. But we dont, and we in fact have evidence that he KNOWS he is lying, and is simply lying to his base to get what he wants or to distract from something far worse.

@yvonnechue9489,"Psalm 2

WHY are the nations in an uproar,
And the peoples devising a vain thing?
The kings of the earth take their stand,
And the rulers counsel together 
Against the LORD and against His Anointed :
""Let us tear their fetters apart,
And cast away their cords from us!""

He who sits in the heavens laughs,
The LORD scoffs at them.
Then He will speak to them in His anger
And terrify them in His fury :
""But as for Me, I have installed My King
Upon Zion, My holy mountain.""

""I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD :
He said to Me, 'Thou art My Son,
Today I have begotten Thee.
'Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Thine inheritance,
And the very ends of the earth as Thy possession.
'Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron,
Thou shalt shatter them like earthenware.'""
Now therefore, O kings, show discernment ;
Take warning,  O judges of the earth. 
Worship the LORD with reverence, 
And rejoice with trembling. 
Do homage to the Son, lest He become angry,  and you perish in the way,
For His wrath may soon be kindled.
How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!

* * * * * * 

I am reading Psalm 2.

My prayer:
May GOD scoffs at all those who have taken part in the US President election cheats  and plots directly or indirectly.  May GOD speak to them in His anger, terrify them in His fury, break them with a rod of iron, shatter them like earthenware until they show discernment and take warning, worship GOD  with reverence, admit their evil mistakes, evil wrongdoings and surrender all the have cheated.",0,2021-01-10T07:58:19Z,2021-01-10T07:58:19Z

Yet when terriost marches and burned our cities, that was called peaceful protesting. No one was brought up on charges then, no one was shot and killed by cops to stop terriost acts, and people protecting small businesses were called Racist Supremicist.

I agree that it not all conservatives should be blamed for this. I voted for McGrath, but I respect McConnell and appreciate his comments. However, l don't believe that democrats are the only ones who demonize their opposition if they disagree. I am huge about having decent conversations, but I have had many conservatives who have immediately called me and all democrats ""snowflakes"" if I so much as brought up and opposing view to Trump or republican policies. I think there are people on both sides who use blanket statements. For example, I have no problem with BLM protests as long as they're peaceful. And there were portions that's were peaceful. But I don't agree with the rioting and destruction. I acknowledge that the protests needed to remain peaceful, and the peaceful protestors last year were overshadowed by violent rioters. However, he did not mention that many conservatives did not give those peaceful protestors respect. Not all conservatives grouped them with the rioters, but some did. I think to acknowledge that some democrats are grouping conservatives with what happened at the Capitol, we also have to acknowledge that some people did the same to you all democrats about last year's riots.

@yeahboyoboy,"Yeah, gonna disagree with you on ""the worst thing since 9-11"" bit. Even to compare it to this is retarded. It was a few hundred followers of hot heads that were in essence escorted in close proximity to doing damage. Agree they shouldn't have gone in, but let's face it...democracy and any form of true representation officially died on Nov. 3. This is simply the funeral. People know (keep in mind that 95% of Americans believe their will never be another fair election), so to show your anger is a bit understandable. Ben, just because the MSM presents it as an insurrection, doesn't mean it really was one. A true insurrection would have had some serious weapons with some seriously organized plans to take over. Besides, how many of them might have been antifa? Some of it looks pretty damned staged. the guy using the police shield to break a window. Capitol police opening the very weak metal barracades (bike racks?), I've seen sever pics of cops being not only compliant to the intrusion, but looks like selfies were a bit more important than putting down this ""insurrection."" If it had been one of those, I doubt too many people inside would be alive. But I'm sure you think the election was totally above board and legit. If you don''t, then it is the duty of the people to go against domestic enemies as well as foreign ones. Again, I don't think this was a smart move as all it does is give this ""new FORM of government"" all the more excuse to kill people who supported the President and who love our Constitution. I wish Trump had told the crowd how to behave and not follow idiots who might be antifa (antifa.com) and (www..antifa.com) if you want to know who they support. Maybe that would have helped. It's all Monday morning quarterbacking and thanks for your self-righteous view. Otherwise, I usually agree with much of what you say, but not here.

But with THIS situation, they’re described as terrorists, and try to convince everyone that this is just “unprecedented” and so awful.  Meanwhile, they’re ok with the burning down of a neighborhood Wendy’s or looting the nearby Foot Locker.  However, if you disrupt Nancy Pelosi’s workplace... that’s a line too far.  It’s amazing, though their livelihoods have not at all been affected (unlike the owner or employees of that Wendy’s or Foot Locker) they seem to be sooo Much more outraged over this than the past 8-10 months of cities literally burning while the cops were told to stand down.

If there were say, a Christian party, a Conservative party, a progressive party, and perhaps a Green party etc. it would take away from the polarized nature of the country.  Perhaps, like corporations that are too large and need to be broken up, so too should the Republican and Democratic parties be broken up.  They have, in many ways, monopolized and certainly polarized the nation. 
I know that won't happen because each party would have to agree to it but perhaps this will evolve in some other way.  We are dual citizens and love both countries, but we choose to raise our kids in Canada, because, it seems so much more civil.  Part of this civility simply comes from having less polarization in politics.",0,2021-01-10T00:41:52Z,2021-01-10T00:41:52Z

@ronbravo4411,"Wow. I used to listen to Ben Shapiro but hearing him say ""the worst thing in America since 9/11"" where 5000+ people died and was the cause of two wars in the Middle East... kinda not the same here. I say this because Ben is a self proclaimed conservative while on the same hand I am watching Tim Poole who is NOT a conservative who has called the act as evil but then reminds everyone of the ""summer of love"" brought to you  by Antifa and BLM. Which by the way caused an estimated 19-35 deaths, was nation wide, caused billions of dollars in damage, created an autonomous zone where two people died, and damage to both Federal and Local Government buildings. I am shocked by the tone so many conservatives have taken as if the Left is going to appreciate what these conservative commentators are saying about Jan 6th. Judging by the rhetoric of the Left it's just a matter of time before they come for Ben and many other conservatives like him since the only thing that seems to make you guilty in their eyes is being a conservative, if you've ever said anything positive about Trump, or if you ever raised any concerns about the 2020 elections (which is what they did for 4 years over the 2016 elections with ZERO EVIDENCE, not some anomalies or improprieties, nut ZERO EVIDENCE). My only encouragement to Ben in all of this is to never forget that the other side hates you. Not disagrees, but hates. You don't have to condone what happened on Jan 6th but again ""worst thing in America since 9/11"" would intentionally ignore what we've experienced from the Left over the past 5+ years. If we are gonna get through this, we need to re-evaluate our approach as conservatives. As Ben himself has admitted we have been in the middle of a culture war for a long time, I don't think it helps to adopt the way your political or cultural enemies describe the situation.",0,2021-01-09T23:51:16Z,2021-01-09T23:56:40Z

@neilorourke71,"Ben's a smart guy, and his arguments and positions make sense in a certain political context. But he makes the deadly assumption that our system of government still in some way serves and represents ""the people""- that those at the highest level can be tamed by our laws and regulations.  This election has made it clear that the government has become its own separate entity apart from the country.  Its representatives no longer represent us, they represent the government.  Trump's term will probably be the last example of a government decision truly made by ""The People"".  That's why so many in our government balked for four years.  They disdain the notion that they're not in control of their futures.  Ben here is making the mistake of projecting his own adherence and belief in law onto these other people- complete psychopaths, shills, grifters, megalomaniacs.  It's painfully clear that the incentives and social dynamics the Constitution was trying to create are not happening.  You need to think about it from a human behavior standpoint. Those in the legislative branch have figured out that they must work together to combat the perceived ineptitude and flippancy of the public.  They view the government as THEIRS.  They are not interested in serving the people, they're interested in making their jobs easier. It's so painfully clear at this point.",6,2021-01-09T22:21:42Z,2021-01-09T22:21:42Z

Also, it seemed like all judges and our supreme court were just not interested in doing anything about the claims. Just the feeling I got from it, but after listening to Ben Shapiro it seems that there was not enough evidence to look into it, which I still think is bologna. I didn't want them to overturn the election. I wanted them to actually look into why all these states changed how they vote and why or how so many of those votes went to Joe Biden. Pretty much everything else I agree with Ben. What I want to have happen now is for all those people who rioted is to find out why they were actually there and were they actually Trump supporters.

We’ve watched our business and churches be shut down over a virus with a 99.6% survival rate, we’ve watched the Democrat party collude with the social media companies to censor us, we’ve watched people all around the country be charged for shooting someone in clear situations of personal defense, we’ve watched BLM and Antifa destroy our cities and kill innocent people with no social repercussions, we’ve watched them slander and attack our president, his followers, and his family for the past four years and labeled us terrorists and who are we? Regular Americans who just want our 1st and 2nd amendment rights protected and to preserve our free market economy that has pulled millions out of poverty and made us a world superpower. Not to mention, there was probably no more than $5,000 worth of property damage, when compared to almost any BLM riot, this shit was nothing, the only thing that makes it a big deal was the fact that it was the capitol which swamp creatures inhabit instead of the businesses of innocent people. It would’ve clearly been better if none of it had happened at all, but you guys should have condemned the violence, condemned the people who got into the building and trashed shit, and said that this was mostly a peaceful protest, you can’t keep playing the left’s game when all they do is cheat.

This is LONG but it is IMPORTANT!!!

Canada's citizens are organizing similar groups because a lot of us are aware of what the threat is... You will begin hearing it more and more because it's not going away and you had better start looking for your allies because the lone wolf will get caught in the chaos!

It is clear that the current administrations do not have our best interests in mind and the time for action is upon us...  It does not have to be violent if we deal with it early enough, but the bottom line is that is will occur.  Canada will return to honoring the Constitution and Charter it was founded on!

Canada and the US have been siblings for far too long!  We have had our sibling rivalries, but all good families do!  Our freedom loving brothers and sisters are mounting their countermeasures to this epic tyranny on a global scale!  And WE THE PEOPLE will be right there along side them!  It's time to take out the trash and settle the dust back where it belongs!  On a Constitutional foundation!  Be encouraged!

@benavraham4397,"Evidence of voter fraud: did any court  deliberate on the evidence? I heard only that courts were coming out with excuses why they did not accept the cases from the beginning.
Witnesses gave affidavits. I never heard that any of them were cross examined in court.
Pennsylvania was not taken to court over fraud,  because the greater case was violation of Pennsylvania state law. After that, fraud becomes redundant. Why did you leave that out? I feel you were misleading.
If Congress can not reject electorial voters, then why does the law provide for such a possibility?

I am convinced, Donald Trump won the election of 2020, but the victory was concealed by voter fraud.

Even Joe Biden himself said that a massive fraud  organization  had been put in place. (I don't understand how he will get  security clearance?)

And, if Pence had sent the double electoral ballots back to the contested states to the constitutional state legislatures for them to confirm and send back only one--- that would have sufficiently and effectively deescalated the protestors. By doing that and getting clarity over which set the state legislatures officially wanted certified, the Congress would not be overriding the will of the people, as the legislatures can lawfully represent their state and confirm the electors they want to endorse.  If it's unclear, then they should investigate.  You claim all of the evidence was heard and examined but I heard that most, if not all the cases were thrown out for either technicalities and/or standing and did not hear the case or render verdicts.  The Supreme Court did not do their sworn duty either and 74 MILLION people feel very disenfranchised.  You say evidence, but that's what is so lacking---in the contrary, I watched the legislatures hold meetings in MI, AZ, and PA with eye witness accounts, saw tons of videos, heard mathematical and logistical impossibilities.   I never heard any evidence proving all of them to be debunked on the contrary, all I heard was, ""That's all false and it's been fact checked.  Courts said so.""  Ok, show me that because now we're back to me just having to accept what I'm being told.  Forgive me, but I'm a little cynical and suspicious at this point.  What would have actually calmed down this mass would have been a thorough audit/investigation as asked for by the objectors.  Instead, we're told, we're stupid not to believe the courts, the media, the big tech and that there's nothing to see here.

@somesillyusername,"i do agree that there was no point to the capitol breach and that it was absolute disgusting stupidity, there was nothing to do at that point and only hurt the right.
i think that trump's retoric was wrong especially post breach.
i think that a lot of the claims of irregularities wasn't checked in good faith and many were treated as some hot potato and were rejected without deliberations.

i think many in trumps side pumped up a lot of talks of some massive proof of fraud that never materialized and that did tremendous harm. they should have been prepared before the election and they weren't, and though i do think there was massive election fraud, the sad truth that they weren't able to prove it.

I agree with this, however you immediately follow up saying that Trump is an exception to this, and is double responsible and not responsible. His speech was the same thing he always says, but during the BLM riots there was actual celebrity and public figureheads calling for violence, or directly supporting it. Saying, ""this is what happens when you upset the people with injustice"" well, the same can be said for this circumstance. Slowly, but surely, I'm beginning to realize that you tilt your views constantly. I don't agree with this comparison, nor do I feel a grown adult would listen to these words and be driven to storm a capital building.

Please Ben, how about you present the actual constitutional excerpts that support your statements. In addition, the continuous acquiescence to the lefts narrative is what is causing this outburst. Shapiro ALWAYS reports from the MSM stated narrative. Demand the right to obey and punish when the right screws up,  and only lip service when the left does it and throw a tantrum but produce no change. Status quo.
Reality is, when one side is expected to sit down and take arrows and obey but the other side remains lawless, then the Constitution never really matters and guarantees the overtaking by the lawless.

@gregwolf1,"I am a democrat and liberal-leaning, and I am honestly sad. I am obviously happy that Biden and the side of the political party which I support has won, but I feel truly hurt for the honest and peaceful republican majority who really believe in their cause. I really hope in 2024 there will be a candidate who will represent you all in a more honest, less selfish, and more graceful manner overall. 

I understand that many people supported and still support Trump, but his reaction to the election results was truly pathetic. I remember in 2016, the republican side was on a high horse about crybaby liberals stomping their feet in their puddle of tears, and rightfully so, but this reaction in the last months and especially recently at the capitol was no less disgracful. 

We are all Americans, we all want the best for this country, and whatever may come, we cannot hate each other. We shall disagree, and engage in discourse, and both sides have very valid points in both liberal and conservative issues. Whatever the republican side saw in Trump, I truly believe you got deceived and lied to. I have rarely seen a more selfish, egoistic, narcissistic liar than Trump, and while he deliberately fingered around in the wounds of America while coming up with solutions, he never truly believed in any of it I think.

Ben don't get over dermatic, until you have all the facts be careful who you point at.  Don't say they are Trump supporters until you investigate and gather the evidence.  
Don't blame a office that had a stroke on the few that broke into Congress.  That is like a heart attack on the NFL playing field and blame the other team.
Ben I have listened many hours to your debates and you are almost always in agreement with my own views.  
How do we present evidence?  Answer: In a Courtroom evidence by both sides.  The evidence is judged on the weight of evidence.  People sit on a witnessed and their testimony is examined by both sides.  
I take up no argument with the Supreme Court in DC but the States ignored Judges order for the voting machines in AZ to be turned over for an audit.  Where machines were examined evidence was found to support the statements if poll workers,  independent auditors.
You seem fired up and set your mind already based upon what you think you seen and what you were told.  Any honest and professional investigator knows that is not the end of a good investigation.
Good in you 93% if the time Ben but this time your in over your head on your overall point.  There are some statements I agree with you on but we are not talking about the same fruit.

You wouldn't listen. Now you're getting to see him do gradeschool-sociopath things.

I agree with Ben that the difference wasn’t overt racism, but I do think it was the result of political bias.

People were forced into a lockdown, businesses closed indefinitely, people lost jobs, some were imprisoned and fined for trying to remain productive in spite of the mandates... then massive fraud takes place and the needed evidence was taken care of immediately after.

@pesco7,"Interesting video. As a center-left liberal, I agree with about 80% of your points. However, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders didn’t work a crowd into a lather and then tell them to march to the Capitol during a joint session of Congress. Trump did. What a horrible comparison and it’s a good thing you didn’t try to argue that point in live debate. Trump was aware of where the line to legal responsibility was, he marched people to the line and waved good luck to them as he stood behind the line. He knew there was no further legal recourse but said he’d never concede or give up against the “fraud”, so by default the only recourse left is that outside of law. In his initial video after the riot, he told them “we love you, you’re very special.” No condemnation at all.

Democrats aren’t angry at “all” Republicans as you suggest with your straw man, only Republicans that mitigate, explain away, and dismiss Trump’s totalitarian behavior until it now cannot be ignored. There were plenty of Republicans who in 2015 called Trump for what he was and is, he never changed despite bad predictions that he would act more Presidential when elected. There were still some Republicans who were honest about him in 2020 as well.

You also have to remember, though, that Trump talked to Sen. Tuberville by phone *while he was sheltering in place as the Capitol was breached* and was still only talking about delaying the votes, not protecting Congress and the Capitol from Pro-Trump rioters.

I do appreciate you calling the spade a spade that this was an act of insurrection.

Without the 2 parties, say if there was only one party ,things would only go one way. Ending in being one sided. you'd think with all the great minds of both parties they'd be able to move mountains and achieve monumental things together, not to have such divide . I've also always thought that the reason for the house and senate was so that one power couldn't go unchecked so to try to come to decisions together? If all these parties , house , senate , supreme court and president were hand and foot it would amount to an (Oligarchy) not a democratic country anymore! We all need to stand by our great constitution, we need right all the people that where  breaking the law during all of the protests. We can't stand for saying one group of protesters is ok and the others group isn't.

Do you not condone the violence that created the country in the first place at the point of the Revolutionary War?

Do you not condone the violence that set the slaves free?

We are far beyond what the founders were willing to put up with. Are you not amazed at so many people who do not truly understand how the founding of the United States came about?

I wonder what the actual good citizens of 1930's Germany would have, as an after thought of, when they would have condoned the violence to stop Hitler?

@michaelk969,"I strongly disagree with you claiming that Trump should not say as president, that the election was fraudulent and stolen from him. The evidence of irregularities/ fraud was massive and all of the institutions that should have ensured that an investigation should have been undertaken to put to rest allegations of fraud failed the American people. We had not only visual evidence but also a cover-up phase where officials were destroying evidence and obstructing any requests for evidence.
As bad as the breach of the Capital building was, as you said on every level, the breach of the sanctity of an individual's vote was far more consequential. People understand how significant is the fact that their votes were reduced to essentially zero value. The anger of most people in the crowd was based on this obvious fact; we were reduced to mere pawns of powerful rich elites who can actually pull off an election theft. People understood that there is no chance that a fair election will ever again be allowed if it is stolen even once.

 I was at the protest. Among perhaps 500,000 people, a very small percentage of true Trump supporters people decided to follow violent Antifa instigators to breach the building, trespass and vandalize. They were indirectly responsible for the chaos that caused the deaths of several people. Of course all people who committed crimes must be prosecuted. But this brings up the initial issue in my mind. Why is it that none of the authorities will lift a finger to even try to investigate election fraud which is much more consequential than let's say a Trump supporter trespassing? State governors,election commissions, state legislators, state and federal courts all were derelict!",0,2021-01-09T05:20:30Z,2021-01-09T05:38:55Z
@sava-aleksej3548,"At 20:40, perhaps thats why the senators just wanted to end this. Because if they did say that there was a voter fraud, then the people will not trust the voting system in the future.

@beatricespedalieri516,"Mr. Shapiro, what do you consider evidence? 
I watched hours of testimonies. If being a witness to something doesn’t count as evidence, then the voice of the people is dead. Not quieted, dead.
To say believing in a thing doesn’t legitimize it, “when evidence is simply not there”...fine, but what evidence are you wanting? If eye witnesses, and suspicious recordings aren’t enough for you to say something seriously is wrong here, I question your judgement. 
...Maybe it is just the Italian in me saying, “there’s something going on here!”, or people just stormed the capitol because something is, and they rather suffer the consequences than say they stood by and did nothing when the Godless overtook the country.
They did a good job quieting the conservative voice. Protests didn’t work. Writing to congressmen didn’t work. Then this riot happens and everyone is shocked. So stupid. Just a taste of what is coming if radicals are ignored. The democratic process has been corrupt for a while. I think people are tired

but you missed everything important about what happened, and you're so quick to say ""there's no legal way to undo what they did illegally"" 

Republicans always lose and say we'll do better next time

the narrative shifts further left each and every time, and acknowledging fraud may have happened but saying ""rules is rules"" is like being stabbed in back by someone, turning around, and saying ""yeah well why don't you do that while im paying attention this time"" - while handing them the knife and getting stabbed from the front next time

this is why trump got elected in the first place and why you'd better hope you can keep your nest egg of criticizing the current administration regardless of who it is because you can advertise yourself to be a libertarian all you want, but just like the rest, you'll whore yourself to protect your relevance

Courts have already been reviewing but the fraud has been so rampant that they need to pretend they aren't enforcing it.

They purposely left the capital building unguarded (not literally, but with the meager amount of security, it might as well have been) knowing people would do exactly this.

Think ''Patriot Act'' times 1000.

Now over the next few  years every social media and platform will add ridiculous policies that will basically give them the power to shut anyone and everyone down that they deem ''conspiratorial'', ''dangerous'', etc--and the context in which those terms will be used for an excuse will be completely up to them, meaning they can and will move the goalpoast at any and every opportunity to censor people (ESPECIALLY conservatives now) into oblivion.

@josephvictory9536,"I don't understand why this wasn't mentioned. How on earth is that anything like a coup? Insurrection maybe but how does that make sense if trump wanted peace and his supporters have been pro police for the most part? 

This whole thing is just terrible, i have no idea why there wasn't more police given the importance of the whole thing and the general importance of protecting senators from foreign actors who may or may not have been in the crowd. Forgetting the obvious angry protesting crowd of however many thousands. 

So much just does not make sense. The only thing i think though is pretty much everyone who directly broke the law and entered or damaged property should go to jail. Its so wrong and so ugly. Civil lawlessness like this is vile and unrepublican and has never been the way we handle things and does not represent the party or even most trump supporters, however much some disagree with the election, or even feel vindicated in the show. Those causing direct chaos are a minority of ingroup members that needs to be purged hard because the disrespect and anarchy is too much and isnt representative of the values which unite the party or define *why* its ethos deserves power through representatives. IMO people like Matt Gaetz, Pence and Cruz carry a lot of this spirit.

So much of what trump has done has been unbelievably excellent, his defenses of the constitution, empowering conservatives, fixing broken enforcement laws (1st step act), getting rid of shit regulations, massive increases to worker wages pre covid, funding the black colleges & opportunity zones, fixing tax law, withdrawing troops, establishing Israel officially, brokering peace deals, positioning against the CCP which they should pay COVID reparations for. Hell he even banned CRT. And now all that incredible progress is smeared in tar and feathered by this freakshow event.

The liberals tolerate the left a lot more than they should and we call them out on that, so we need to do the same (which i think is what we have been doing, so go us). 

Hurts to think of whats next. Given how repubs are routinely annihilated by leftist media, i am 100% sure everyone who should be arrested will be arrested and the response will be overbearing, as usual with lasting negative second order consequences for the constitution. (the likely 2A and 1A restrictions; they have house senate and presidency and could easily just put in a few more judges to get the SC) Forget about all the european crap theyre going to try. 

The only good thing short term in all this is maybe, just maybe (and i am being hopeful) the radicalized left will take a hit on the police issue. Since, well, liberal policing standards have obviously failed miserably here and for as daft as they can sometimes be, liberals aren't stupid when their bottom line (class culture) gets touched. But i doubt it. Sigh, if the left doesn't fuck things up monumentally for the liberals, its going to be hard to regain any momentum. This is just major level disenfranchisement. and with the media more aggressive and empowered than ever, a large amount of regular conservatives are going to either check out or get pushed further and further to the hinterlands.

But if there is one long term shining ray of hope, its that much like Shapiro today saying we need to invest in culture. I think many conservatives are seeing the need to settle and focus on contributing the balance of these views to society through direct investment or creation of institutions, education, culture and this is a long walk that requires concerted and often fearless effort. Having all this garbage heaped on us by the media can either demoralize us, or cause us to laugh it off in pursuit of what we know and trust to be noble and well evidenced goals.",0,2021-01-09T04:29:20Z,2021-01-09T04:29:20Z

POC would not be treated with the same luxury; being escorted out, hand in hand with cops, taking selfies with them, etc. Our mutilated bodies would decorate the front steps of the building, we would be mocked and ridiculed for years to come.

So many Republicans are using this time to distance themselves from this moment, when I’m reality they should be apologizing to black people for praising the police officers that would shoot them in the back without hesitation. They should be apologizing for voting a monster into office, a monster who, while his supporters were storming the Capital, he was still spreading lies about how the election was rigged.

@cybercapri,"You say, Ben Shapiro, that you're a Conservative and when WE THE PEOPLE finally take ACTION you show your TRUE, LIBERAL, Color of YELLOW SPINE as the coward that you ARE, and that's a FACT. Perhaps the version of the Constitution that you've read leaves out the part that ""Those that CAN ACT, MUST ACT"" to save the Republic. Perhaps you simply glossed over that section, either way you CLEARLY MISSED READING IT because that is what WE THE PEOPLE WERE DOING WHEN THEY MARCHED ON WASHINGTON DC. For YEARS I've watched your videos and supported your actions until this Opening Dialog where you show just how much of a Spinless TWIT Coward you TRULY ARE. Every Time you talked you seemed to make sense until NOW. 

You know the difference between WE THE PEOPLE acting in PROTECTION of the Constitution and BLM committing acts of TERROR? NO, you don't, so pay attention here; when WE THE PEOPLE marched on Washington DC, because of the FRAUD that was the 2020 Election, not only were the Police CALLED but also the National Guard. When WE THE PEOPLE were told to GO HOME, THEY DID. They didn't leave Washington DC Trashed the way BLM left areas trashed; they went the FUCK HOME. BLM commits ACTS OF TERROR over and over again and I don't see you getting all upset the way you did in the first two minutes of this video. BLM commits Acts of Terror not only should the National Guard been called but the Active Army as well and they should have been SHOT ON SIGHT for TREASON; but NO, the Police were told to STAND DOWN and the National Guard was too busy to bother. I am not singling out JUST BLM HERE but simply using BLM to represent EVERY TERROR Group engaged to Attack America from within to include but not limited to Antifa and all others out there getting paid to be allowed to RIOT. 

You say ""it was the most horrifying things you've seen in your lifetime"" then have the audacity to continue with ""what we saw yesterday was INEXCUSABLE, UNJUSTIFIABLE, all for one on every level DISGUSTING"" and I have to say What the FUCK were you watching. Sure it was bad and clearly NOT as organized the way BLM and other terror groups were, but you say the MOST HORRIFYING THING YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR LIFETIME, OMG did you NOT see the twin towers being blown to bits and people jumping to their deaths??? Holy Fuck you're a hypocrite. 

America is being TAKEN FROM US FROM WITHIN and a semi peaceful, CONSERVATIVE, Crowd taking action to DEFEND HER is the MOST HORRIFYING THING YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR LIFETIME; FUCK YOU BEN the TRAITOR. You are NOT a Conservative and pray we don't accidently cross paths in life because the only thing worse than a pedophile is a RINO that sells out their Country for GREED; and you, Ben, are said RINO. You are Republican in NAME FUCKING ONLY. WE THE PEOPLE need to be ARMED the next time they take on the Capital. The Police need to STAND DONE and the National Guard best JOIN WE THE PEOPLE so that Traitors such as Polesi, Schumer, McConnell and the REST of the Swamp Lizards can be held accountable for this attempted INSERECTION of the United States. Holy Fuck, BEN THE COWARD, you're siding with the ENEMY and don't even know it and that makes you a spineless coward. Marching on Washington DC is the ONLY Act that WE THE PEOPLE have to ensure our Constitution Stands but if NO ONE ACTS, America FALLS... I did not EVER think for one fucking microsecond that I'd ever live long enough to see such a thing; yet here it is unfolding before me and I am helpless to do anything about it. 

You will see what they will do with the Spineless cowards that put these criminals in power when America Falls. They won't bother to use bullets they will just tell you to stay home and STAVE YOU TO DEATH then bulldoze everything over and start anew.

@cheerfulturtlegirl,"The only hope for us is Jesus Messiah. He is the true King of kings and Lord of lords. Neither the far right nor the far left will be able to solve our greatest problem: sin. We need Jesus to save us. We need to return to the two most important commandments:

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew 22:37‭-‬40

God loves us, but He is calling us to repentance. He is holy and judges righteous judgment. We cannot continue putting our trust in man, governments, or constitutions to save us. We must be willing to humble ourselves before our perfect, pure, holy, and righteous Creator God. Jesus will return and He will reign over all the earth.

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John 14:6

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
Acts 4:12

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.   
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

@AdamAdamHDL,"Trump has fractured the GOP support pool. Next election the Republican party won't get nearly as many votes because Trump has taught people it's a fraud (because his ego can't accept loss). Trump will likely start his own party taking supporters with him, further weakening Republican support. 
   I predict the democrats are going to win the next 3 elections as a result. But first let me talk about life insurance, don't gamble with an insurance company that you will die soon enough for your family to benefit, the insurance company is gambling that you will strive to survive and they are probably right.

@garyk.nedrow8302,"I usually agree with Ben, but on the storming of the Capitol, let's wait and see who actually breached the building.  They didn't look or act like the peaceful MAGA marchers on the Mall.  The looked and acted like the Antifa instigators that fomented faux riots in our cities last summer.  Some marchers followed them in, and one unarmed woman was shot dead when the Capitol police panicked.  But who first broke through the doors and  why was there relatively little resistance from the guards?  It all looked as staged as the summer riots and used the same M.O.

Next, consider who benefited.  The ""riot"" only served the Democrat's political agenda: it disrupted the debate on election fraud, it discredited the MAGA march, and it resurrected the Democrat's call to impeach Trump.  It all seems a little too pat.  Moreover, the Democrats who promptly denounced the ""riot"" or ""insurrection"" as Trump's fault all seemed to be speaking from the same script -- as though they had advance notice.  Strange, isn't it?  

Let's find out who the firebrands were that broke through the Capitol doors and who paid them.  Those who benefit from an act are usually the ones who finance it.  Follow the money.  And let's see who bails out the people arrested -- and how quickly.  The media is unanimously singing from the liberal's song book on this, and my guess is that the public is being had -- once again.

This isn’t about taking sides. This is about upholding the constitution and doing what’s right.
Trump has handled himself particularly poorly since the Nov election was held. His arguments have lacked coherency.
However, this doesn’t diminish all of the fake news and woke culture and BLM and Antifa and the danger represented by social media (eg. Endorsing BLM and Antifa riots for months but shutting down any Trump supporters).
Ben is also right, shutting down conversation will make things far worse (that’s a HINT YouTube).
We need rational discourse and Silicon Valley and the democrats and the mainstream media are strongly against rational discourse.

@Crybarcz228,"Ben, I'm going to have to disagree with you. The temperature was raised by the Democrats as far back as 2016 and they turned up the heat every step of the way. Donald Trump, in my opinion, took a stance to say"" we are not going to take it any more and we will not give up"". This stance is held by many and Trump represents exactly what he got elected for.  The supporters of Trump have been terrorized, beat up, they have been silenced, censored, lost their jobs and even killed by the opposition over their beliefs. Are you saying that it's Donald Trump's fault for putting up a final fight and representing them any different then they asked for? Do you believe that people went to Capitol Hill just because of Trump? Wrong, they went because the system they put so much faith in failed them in their eyes and more so in their hearts as Americans. They watched long and hard and had had enough. They stood by the sidelines enough. They were unprotected enough by the elected officials they voted for. They watched their cities burn and businesses close. They were again unprotected and given no consideration by the highest courts in the land. They were falsely accused as racists, bigots and white supremacists.  Is it safe to say that people wanted their country back and that they wanted their way of life back and were willing to go down fighting in the end? That they were not going to let it be stolen by the final use of a failed political system against them one last time? Honestly you're sermon here sounds a bit like a Monday morning quarterback. No offense but you're speaking from a perspective of perfection in due process and it's just a bit of a tone deaf perspective applied best in a ""perfect world"" simulation. Truthfully, what do people 'really' do when they feel their most sacred truth and right of due process and law have failed them?..... yup... they fight and Trump is exactly what they voted for in order to protect that way of life in their eyes. What happened at Capitol Hill, politically, emotionally, patriotically, is the equivalent of when the last lifeboat was lowered from the Titanic to which people were given that final obstructed allowance for survival. I don't blame Trump because while he could have just told everyone not to show up ..... that notion, that kind of mantra, is not what brought those people to Washington in the first place. It's a whole hell of lot more. Check out your history. it's littered with final stands because of strong beliefs and the human/American ultimatum of ""live free or die"". People truly felt they weren't living free any more. Call it stupid, call it what you will but this soup was served cold to the Trump supporters a long time ago.

Patriots did not (as you argue) want Congress to overthrow the election result (that's a self-serving, false view of their position). Instead, they wanted an investigation into the alleged cheating in the swing states that made the difference between Trump winning and Biden winning, so that a wrong could be righted. Congress willfully ignored these objections and forced the certification of illegal election results, something that may be illegal in itself. That cannot be allowed to stand, otherwise democracy and the rule of law are dead in America.

The days they passed the ""Patriot Act"" or the Authorizations of Military Force were much worse than the brief invasion of the Temple of the Secular gods.

Yet the second conservatives step out of line after years of being dehumanized for merely being conservatives its the end of the world.

It is what it is.

Go add up the cost of damage done by the left in the last year vs the right, its not even comparable.

The left always justify when blacks do something wrong.
It always boils down to how badly they have been treated, so you know what, shit happens.

If dems had lost they would have been doing far worse.

in fact they have been and there are millions of videos of them ripping trump supporters out of their cars and behaving like animals LONG before this happened.  Burning churches, police stations, killing people.  So not, I won't care too much if after 4 years of abuse less than .00000001% of voters went a bit wild.

@warfan1994,"No Ben I’m sorry one building being overrun on one day is not equivalent to 9/11. Seeing just about every major city burn with cop cars on fire people being shot (not by police), over 200 buildings being burned and businesses looted along with over 2 billion in property damage that lasted over 90 days. So sorry I don’t think politicians/millionaires who had there building overrun with no attempt to burn it down or kill anyone is worse than what happen over the summer as civilians died and businesses burned and looted nor is it equivalent to 9/11. 
And Ben these people are frustrated as a voter in Georgia who yes I did vote in the runoff for republicans and I voted for them previously along with Trump, we see on the local news the videos of poll watchers being asked to leave and then suit cases of ballots being scanned late at night, and instead of people getting answers like “yeah that’s protocol nothing out of the normal” or “yeah it’s being investigated this was not protocol and an irregularity” instead we get called crazy and are told oh you didn’t see it right or hey it’s no big deal where all we want is answers. I’ve had to listen to 4 years of Trump being called a racist and that he colluded with Russia and just about every investigation thrown at him and then him being impeached over what Biden did. Now that we finally call for investigations where’s a special counsel? Where’s a report by someone giving us a long explanation on how yes democrats are terrible but nothing illegal happen here which is pretty much what Mueller did. I’m tired of the hypocrisy and double standard. This while also being told that Covid is bad and you need to stay inside and wear masks when you go out but if you riot and loot in the masses in the name of a fake cause that blacks are being gunned down for no reason then you’re fine! 
Spare me the lecture because I do think it’s bad that these people in D.C. did what they did but what else’ are they suppose to do? There voices aren’t heard and questions aren’t answered and after all they’ve seen all summer long they probably didn’t think anything bad would happen. Oh and if a black women climbing over a door was shot in the neck by a cop during a BLM protest trust me “systematic racism” would be on every headline of every news channel for the next 2 years+ hell they still talk about Charlottesville.

You also go on to say that there have been many challenges by the Trump administration in the lower courts. And all of them have failed. How can you say that when the courts themselves failed to adhere to the rule of law, allow Discovery and independent research into devices, papers, and monitors? How can you say that the process was true and just when the courts FAILED to it here to the rule of law?

Well I find most of your commentary on issues to be fairly objective, today I found it to be obversely abjective.

You also go on stating that President Trump was fanning the flames of the events that happened in DC. You also say that he has the right to free speech, and to say what he feels. How can you object to his anger and frustration at the results of the election when evidence is put out there yet not properly looked at? It would be like you getting multiple parking tickets, having your vehicle impounded, tried before the courts, and they would not listen nor see evidence that your vehicle, yourself, nor anyone associated with you, being in the facility of where the parking tickets were issued.

Where I have my doubts that you, nor anyone else there at the daily wire, will even bother to respond to my comments, I am still putting it out there.",3,2021-01-08T20:13:25Z,2021-01-08T20:13:25Z

@OBKingofKings,"One of my favorite 2A quotes states “I don’t carry a gun because it’s a weapon, but because it’s a shield”. Every responsible gun owner doesn’t go out trying to shoot people and most never want to have to (same with police) but will use this force if necessary to defend their rights and liberties. 

How does this tie in?

Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck, Crowder, Owens, Pool etc etc. So called “alternative” media have been telling us for a minimum of 4 years that the Left’s agenda is crazy and detrimental to society. From transgenderism for children, the attack on free speech, rising costs of healthcare, COVID, lockdowns, you name it. LEFT LEFT LEFT. 

If these assaults on the republic are TRUE then it’s not a matter of IF the people should rise up but WHEN. 1/6 was TAME compared to what it should have been. For all those pundits that are condemning it to save financial interests I suspect, shame on you. You’re no better than Republicans abandoning the people at a time of crisis you played an instrumental role inflating. Shame on you and anyone who supports you should immediately withdraw funding. No need in supporting alternate media simply to have it bite you in the ass.",1,2021-01-08T20:10:51Z,2021-01-08T20:14:18Z
@hlowrylong,"The greatest assault on democracy is the Republicans are too stupid to realize that the entire script was written by the Democrats. The Democrats knew that a lot of the long-standing DC Republican whores wanted to get rid of Trump for good, because they were as much of the Swamp as the DNC. So they cheated in those 5 counties, almost too obviously in Fulton County as they were videotaped doing it, to piss Trump supporters off. Democrats knew it would be hard to prove and knew the Republican judges would never allow any of the cases move forward. So then — they knew the protests would grow angry and they all took advantage of the losers who stormed the Capitol — knowing the media had already started calling the Protesters ‘thugs & mobs & rioters’ before any violence occurred. So then everyone jumps on the bandwagon throwing Trump under the bus, despite NEVER EVER EVER throwing Biden & Kamala & all the City Rioting Mayors under the bus for their encouragement of the 4 months of summer riots. They blame Trump despite not once blaming those folks for 4 months!!! Thus, this pisses me off so much that I’ve withdrawn from the Republican Party & will seek a third party. (And a lot of folks will be doing the same!!!).  And I’m doing it despite the fact that I know that if a good 3rd party comes along, it will destroy any chance of ever having my preferred candidate elected, but I know it will ruin the Republican Party. I should lead the party, and name it the Spite Party. Being betrayed by my own party is worse than the Leftist Socialists. Candidly, it doesn’t matter which party is in office — there’s very little Conservatism left in the USA, even much of Donald Trump’s actions sadly will lead to too much US debt, and he didn’t get rid of Obamacare. So at the end of the day, none of it matters because humans are flawed and immoral, and the founders never envisioned a- the Power of the Media and b- that the checks & balances would fail because we were just too corrupt, in $$ and in voting.

I won’t likely vote again. Third party might get my donations, but I know it is all rigged. Ben is a smart lawyer but he isn’t a mathematician—winning those 5 counties legitimately while losing every other key one was nearly a mathematical impossibility.

@bking321,"I thought Ben Shapiro was a brilliant man, and that may be true, but I can assure you that he is a man of little integrity. His complete failure of acknowledging what had really been going on since the election when there are plenty of others out there who have fluently and accurately shown us the truth, shows you that he doesn't much care about justice or the American people. Yesterday is the greatest day in Modern Political history because it is the catalyst to exposing the truth about the Deep State, the corruption of politicians, the influence of foreign actors and will allow POTUS to finally drain the swamp and free our country from the treasonous actors who have participate over the decades in this undermining of the country.

@davidsenescu8505,"I rarely  reply but....Oh Ben.. The facts presented  were never looked at by the courts before  it was thrown  out  on  filing  technicalities . Court wouldn't  let  them file before , during, or after election. Then tells them it's  too late?  Can't  believe  you fell for the media  narrative  of the courts rejected  the  cases, when the merits weren't  ever looked  at lol. 
    Did you even see the arena footage or any testimony  of blatant  disregard  for the constitution? In non legislative  bodies  last minute,  and under the gise of covid, unilaterally changing election  laws? 
 Barbarian  man  and many others proven  to  be ANTIFA by facial recognition from summer  riots.  Riots that  killed  many more and caused  millions  in private  property  damage.  But people taking selfies  in congress is worse.  Protesters  didn't  kill that woman,  cops did.  
  Trump supporters  are on camera trying  to  stop the rioters. Why would  they disrupt the process? They wouldn't,  but the left would.  I  know I'm  an ex Democrat. If you want to  fight the media, then don't promote  their narrative of a siege from picture  taking  ANTIFA. I watched live the footage  on FOX and CSPAN simultaneously ,the media spin of everyone  walking in the streets. No fires, or violence,  but reported  as a riot. Don't  forget the rapidly  prepared  speeches by Schumer  and Pelosi  for seeking 25th amendment, and  impeachment.  Plan much?
    As if it's  worse than last summer when buildings  were on fire and the media  reported a peaceful  protest. But a few hundred people  walking  loudly through congress is a siege?  It's  a  joke ! Even when Trump supporters  were inside they were calm.  Cops were the ones shooting.  
    At least  you recognize  the double  standard  with certain  narratives.   What about  the narrative  that judges and congressmen don't  want to look into  voter fraud  because  it will call into question  their election results  as well. Especially if they used dominion. 
   When the courts, congress, and the media  make redress, and  peaceful  protest  impossible,  violent  protest  is inevitable. It seems  you ignore that the certification challenge  is valid, that's  the rhetoric pushing  the country  towards  the Civil War  you, me and many don't t want. Because  when you let a blatantly  fraudulent election  stand, the people  are never going to accept  this or any other  election  unless  this one is properly  challenged. Why won't Dominion  let forensic  teams look at machines? 
  Obviously the breach was meant  to disrupt  the process,  as the evidence  was being  presented i.e. 1000 affidavits likely  lost in the frenzy  of selfies.  Pics of police  with guns drawn  is  media narrative propaganda  to make it look worse than it was when I witnessed  it live.
    It's  worse than the censorship you oppose.  
   Why would big tech censor the pics/ videos of protest? Maybe  because  they show rioters  being  let into  capitol, or that 99.999% of the protesters were peaceful,  and .001% agitators were responsible. That security  was lax and allowed protesters  in.
    Why didn't  they burn congress down like the minority  owned small businesses  in summer  riots?  Maybe just  to scare  politicians  into not challenging the  certification,  as per their constitutional oath to do just  that  upon any question  of election  validity.  Even you admit voter irregularities which constitute  a question  of validity. 
    You're  like  the Doogie Houser  of law, but fail to realize  that Pence can send desputed electors  back to  the states legislators. If they can't  resolve  it, then voted on in the House  where only 1 state delegate per  state  can vote.  Not every house member. And in that case Republicans  hold  the majority.  So it's  not congress desertification,  they simply don't  count  disputed electors,  and if no one gets 270 then it goes  back to state legislators.  If they can't  resolve  it ,the house who represents  the states does. It's  laid out in the constitution. At least  according  to Mark Levine  and many constitutional  scholars. 
  In closing,  it is the people's  right to storm the capittol when their government  refuses  to listen,  just like in the revolution  that gave us our freedom  to have this country.  But that's not what happened Wednesday,  agitators  sent by ANTIFA  through  discovery of emails stated  as much. It was planned by them to disrupt  the protest  and the process. The process  of finding  out  if indeed  we had free and fair elections.  
   10× more people  on both sides think this election  was fraudulent, compared  to the last  one. That bad a special  counsel  investigate  for 2 years with little  circumstantial evidence.  This time there's  video, multiple  corroborating  witnesses,  several  real whistle-blowers from multiple  agencies, and signed  affidavits.

Second, right after she’s ‘shot’, there are capitol and DC police on her side of the door giving assistance the MOMENT she hits the floor.  (No response is that fast no matter how good you are) Why didn’t the officers on her side of the door  (easily within arms reach) simply pull her back through the window, stop her from climbing through, or at least communicate to other officers that she had no weapon and was not an immediate threat?? Third, officers didn’t bother to clear the room to address any additional threat directly after the incident.  And last, we are always taught that you don’t fire unless you are in eminent danger.

@mezo72271,"Yet the government said for 4 years long that Trump stole the election with the interfere of Russian, without evidence. The legal team's claims weren't heard most of the time, they rejected it on standing, not merit. In the beginning after the election the lawsuits weren't that good I admit, but they developed with time. 1 week ago the Georgia legislature voted unanimously to check the ballots but the board of supervisors rejected any access. They only wanted 2 hours, that's it. What do you think, if everything was fair, why hide so hard? Just look at the vote graphs from the battleground states. No one in right mind would say it's okay. Votes literally dropped live on cnn.

What you forgot to mention Ben:
-that the Pennsylvania case was brought to the supreme court in the summer but they said the elections didn't happen yet so we couldn't see the effect, come back after the election. Judge Thomas and Alito said it's going to be a real problem
-Trump tweeted multiple times that he demands a PEACEFUL protest. He even said in his speech what you took these sections from. He said they are going to march there PEACEFULLY. In fact, he wanted to go there but hell broke loose. There are literally videos that the peaceful protesters bood and hold back the rioters, you can hear they say they are from antifa. They were in full tactical gear. These were agitators, not Trump supporters. Never happened any violence on his rallies, not even in the last 2 march in Washington.
-You should've played the whole clip from Ted Cruz. He said it should be investigated, and if democrats didn't believe the irregularities and it comes true after they investigate it, than that is good, we win back our faith in election processes.
-They didn't want to throw them out, but send them back to the state legislatures to discuss it.

@joebright4607,"Ben this is the first thumbs down I've ever given on YouTube. How can you say that this election wasn't proven fraud when the only thing for sure is no one agreed to judge the merit of the cases. They were all dismissed because of standing or procedural issues. The lawyers and judges were being doxed and their families and firms threatened so they refused to hear the cases. Why did the pole counters try to hide everything if it is all on the up and up ? Why wouldn't they alllow for substantiation after the whole thing ? If they didn't commit fraud then why the cover ups ?  One thing is totally undeniable and that is that ""big tech"" and the MSM controlled the flow of information the last four years so that only one side was heard. We knew six months ago about Hunter Bidens laptop, his ties to the China deal that daddy took him on air force two to go do a multi billion dollar deal with and collect several million dollars. We knew about Barista cooperation paying Hunter some eighty grand a month to be on the board off a company in a country he did not know the language of and had no background in energy. We know Daddy stepped in when they were investigating that company and got the prosecutor in another country fired by threatening to withhold 500 million dollars in aid from the United States ( when we were the United States). "" son of a bitch, he was fired"""". This is just now starting to come out and it may get buried now that daddy's there to sweep it all under the rug as usual.  All of this makes it a fraudulent election as far as I am concerned. If Biden was in the military, because of his actions he couldn't get any kind of clearance, but now he is to be the commander in chief ?  Voting machines with a 65% failure rate. Connected to the Internet so they could be hacked by any tech savvy person in less than a minute. Thousands of depositions (under penalty of perjury) that were never considered because the judges were too afraid to hear them.  Where the hell have you been Ben ?

@liontribe1,"https://mobile.twitter.com/ThatTrumpJew

Ben Shapiro, your take is supremely flawed and invested in the understanding of the same prominent talking heads that have been lying to us for years.

Simply, what happened in D.C. was ugly.  But, these people have been locked down, censored, neglected, suppressed, and labeled deplorable; and that was before they marched on Washington.

They are running out of peaceful options, and you are tone deaf.  Trump was right when he asked, ""What did you expect?""

You think the Boston Tea Party was pretty?  I'll remind you, they rioted and destroyed property.

I neither condemn or condone the actions of those who broke in, and have consigned to reserve judgment for now, but neither side, and you, cannot lay claim to the moral high ground here.

Obviously, the true path forward is through finding a way to ensure consideration for all.

Unrest is all but assured now.  It doesn't go away with Biden's inauguration.  In fact, counter to what Leader McConnell says, Biden's inauguration starts the death spiral of our Republic.

Understand that your eccentric, self-aggrandizing p.o.v, is a product of your privileged life.  A privileged life should not be considered a bad thing, but you cannot rightfully justify your opinion on your insufficient life experience in this context.

The same crowd saying, ""Violence doesn't solve problems,"" are the same people being protected by those willing to do violence on their behalf.

It's ugly, and it shouldn't have to be.  BUT IT'S BEEN UGLY, and it's only getting uglier!  What's the big picture here?  How do we achieve peace?

Half our country believes they are disenfranchised.  They've been abused, and you think they're just going to go away?

Whether you're right or wrong, these people demonstrated that they're here and they're willing to make they're voices heard, even through doing things I personally disagree with.  That's not what I would've done, but I get why people are pissed, and their anger will be ignored no longer.

Edited to add a twitter link. (Twitter video of Trump Supporters being let into the Capitol building deleted.)  Ben Shapiro should retract his statements immediately and apologize.",1,2021-01-08T18:53:14Z,2021-01-09T20:45:28Z

@noticedruid4985,"Ben I disagree with you just a little, the people who support Trump all they are asking is for a investigation into the contested battleground states, And to have a fair day in court. So far they haven't, most of those 50 cases were dismissed not for the merit of their evidence but for latches, lack of standing, mootness.

Also they did not do any proper investigation in Georgia, they simply recounted the same votes that were suspected, There was no audit.

You say that the American people just have to accept a stolen election or else other people will be mad. Well just because Republicans are more proper does not mean we will just sit and take it. And Congress does have a say in the election process they are not a rubber stamp, they are the final authority on a contested election.",0,2021-01-08T18:39:51Z,2021-01-08T18:39:51Z

Trump is a proxy, brexit in the uk was too for the far left and far right to gain a foothold and attack the centre. People in the centre are dangerous, right up to Election Day they can change their minds. Neither party want this, it worries them, forces their candidates to be infallible. Believing they can win more central people than they loses they want to force it as a left or right choice. Blind supporters of both sides are the ones they want. If the candidate does something widely condemned it’s ok they’ll still vote to them, it won’t cost them votes. Trump has been the republicans proxy for this and the democrats have loved it too. He divides so much virtually no one has no opinion on him. But the more the far take power, the more and more we head to disaster. Trump isn’t Hitler, never has been never will be. But the same embers that lead to a Hitler, burn now. National Socialism, fear of a religious group. The problem is now the void that Trump leaves could be filled by a Hitler.

@merriemerrie7378,"Some good points, but I caution Ben against knee-jerking into oversimplifying blame in order to vent his frustration.  Free, fair and transparent elections are the foundation of our republic.  A great many of the disgruntled voters are not demanding legislatures flip the elections, but stall certification due to eroded confidence resulting from the triad of fraud, lack of transparency and resistance to thorough investigation. As J Turley has written, most of the legal challenges were dismissed on standing, not merits.  Also take issue with Ben’s emphasis that 40% of the people could be wrong. Fine, but 40% of the people could be right, especially in a political climate where media, tech monopolies, law enforcement agencies, government bureaucrats and especially politicians have proven to be astoundingly willing to lie, cheat and steal.  It is foolish to be dismissive of widespread loss of voter confidence in absence of a thorough investigation and especially unhelpful in the context of a Trump-blaming rant.  We get it, Trump has made some serious mis-judgements -- but it leftist domination of information (and thereby socialization and power) by media and monopoly tech, not Trump supporters, that is truly undermining government by consent of the people.",0,2021-01-08T17:55:42Z,2021-01-08T17:55:42Z

@Wolf88888,"Ben Shapiro, you are absolutely disgusting. Let me do my own little re-cap:  In 2016, the American people came together and--LEGITIMATELY--elected a president who they believed would not only defend the U.S. Constitution, but also protect our heritage and our national sovereignty. That man was Donald J. Trump, and he followed through on the promises he made to his constituents in an absolutely stellar way. He created the greatest economy in 50 years, pushed back on foreign incursions into our government, trade deals, and policies, promoted border security, fought against corruption, established national energy independence, and so much more. For the first three years of his presidency, we were forced to witness a vile attempt at a coup d'etat by Democrats and deep-state insiders as they attempted to not only overthrow Trump, but the will of the American people. THAT insurrection was aided and supported by a relentless and vicious anti-Trump propaganda campaign carried out by the mainstream media, Big Tech, and social media operatives. Then, at the outset of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic, which was created by China, hit the world. The Democrats and radical leftists exploited the crisis and the enormous loss of human life as an opportunity to not only wrongly place the blame on Trump (who, very rightfully, did everything he possibly could to stem the crisis and properly assign responsibility), but also used the pandemic as a tool to illegally manipulate voting laws in order to cheat and disenfranchise millions of Americans out of their votes. Through the entirety of this last year, we have watched as Democrats and the media either sat on their hands, or evenly openly praised, Black Lives Matter and Antifa thugs as they raped our cities, terrorized our citizens, and burned buildings to the ground. We have witnessed Democratic governors who, under the guise of 'public safety', have used the pandemic as a means to exercise tyrannical and wholly unlawful power. And now, yet again, we have been forced to witness the wholesale theft of an election. Donald J. Trump clearly won that election, and even though the evidence of election rigging, voter fraud and manipulation is now mountainous and undeniable, it has all but been ignored by not only Democrats, but also by cowardly, spineless Republicans. And NOW, after all that, shills like you, who are complete cowards and who hold more allegiance to your party and your money than you do the American people, have the brazen audacity to label as 'insurrectionists' and 'perpetrators of treason' those courageous patriots who finally stood up and declared that they have had enough! Well, all I can say to you, and the rest of the politicians, media 'pundits', and corporate bobble heads is this:  Buckle-up, baby!  You see, you all have it terribly, terribly wrong. You imagine that this is about Donald Trump? It's not. This election wasn't stolen from Donald Trump; It was stolen from that core of Americans who are still patriotic and who will die to defend our nation and our liberty. And we are NEVER going to submit, shut our mouths, or go away until we have reclaimed our country and rescued it from the hands of unprincipled sellouts like you.",0,2021-01-08T17:47:59Z,2021-01-08T17:47:59Z

I honestly don’t understand your argumentation against the senators, you seem to put them at the same level as Trump which is absolutely ridiculous. You may disagree with Cruz, just like you probably disagreed with the democrats in 2016. So what? 

The democrats are accusing them of sedition, a very serious accusation, and you pile on because of what exactly?

This is about much more then Trump, it’s very serious on Democrats want to remove elected senators. Rioters have no power, the democrat establishment has the power to put the US under authoritarian rule.

@gofigure17,"1.) If anyone tries to defend what happened at the Capitol, or criticizes Shapiro for condemning it, you are deluded and a traitor to this country. PERIOD. It is not your God-given right to storm government buildings, especially the building that probably most represents our democracy. I voted for Trump. I voted almost all Republican this year because what the Democrats stand for these days goes against what I believe in. But he lost. Accept it. Trying to throw out the results of the electoral college by force or intimidation via mob rule is reprehensible. And to say that Trump did not incite this is in denial. He literally told the crowd that they would march together to the Capitol. He said he would be there with his supporters. He was not. 
2.) Being overly critical of Shapiro for doing his job by advertising is simply petty. He can definitely be accused of a poor segue. But these advertisements are standard in all of his shows. To judge him now as a sellout is, again, just petty. He is not working for a nonprofit organization, and he is not a traditional newsman. He is an op-ed podcast host who gets paid to advertise things. There are contracts and agreements made between two parties that require advertisements to be done at certain points of a show. Shapiro could find himself in breach of contract for not holding his end of the deal. Don’t be so quick to be so righteous and socially conscious, or you might start to sound like the Liberals you criticize. Remember, we live in a capitalist society. I cannot judge him for trying to make a living. Again, definitely can be criticized for a bad transition, but anything more than that is just being a jerk about it.",1,2021-01-08T17:16:32Z,2021-01-08T17:16:32Z

A sliver of trouble makers took advantage of the event to get their day in the sun.  Can we not celebrate the 99.9% and condemn the .1% at the same time?  Honestly if this were in the era of our founding fathers, people would be labeled traitors for what was done during the election and people would be hung. The left is perpetually outraged and acts like this all the time.  When the world gets a little whiff of outrage from the right, they clutch their pearls.

IMO Republicans had a good idea what the mob would do and Republicans made sure 1) there would be an insufficient police presence and 2) there would be sufficient numbers of police sympathetic (i.e pro trump) to trump. I believe this was masterminded by trump and his allied Republicans to intimidate the Democrats and any Republicans who weren't allied to trumps election lies. My take on what we see unfolding is the powerful  (trump and his allied Republicans) getting off of the hook and the everyday people who were in the mob taking the fall (getting charged). I bet trump and his allied Republicans had some of there people infiltrate the proud boys and others of these groups in an effort to provide some sort of control over the outcome (such as tamping down the amount of violence).,0,2021-01-08T16:40:11Z,2021-01-08T16:40:11Z

@eginteractive,"The part that bothers me is that there are people who fail to view trump critically. He's gained such a cult status among certain conservatives, and it's actually troubling. Don't get me wrong, I've been quite happy with how things pre-pandemic had gone, but the election was a complete disaster that will forever be a blight on the Republican party. There's nothing wrong with challenging the results, but you do so in a professional and respectful manner. I especially felt bad for Pence for the position that Trump put him in. He asked Pence to do something that would go against the Constitution, and then when Pence refused he went off on him. Then the Democrats tried using him to apply the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. This is a sad act of desperation, everything Trump has done will be forgotten over him throwing a tantrum over the fact that he lost the election (regardless of your thoughts on the security of the election, legally he lost). And now the Republican party is splintering, it's going to be a long time before we see another conservative win office.",0,2021-01-08T16:31:13Z,2021-01-08T16:31:13Z

A shooter attacks several GOP congressmen at soft ball practice.  The powers of government intel and law falsified information to impeach a president.  A judge has all sorts of lies thrown at him and even those hearing protestors barraged in.  Anyone associated with the president is investigated.  If I remember the streets of DC were filled with rioters and the President was taken to the bunker at one point.  Yet when some how protestors are let through weak security it's the worse day?  Oh and I never heard one of those Dems telling looters and rioters to go home.  No though I don't agree with them flooding the capitol building it was far from the worse day in political history.

GA Sec of State Raffensperger letter to Congress was sent as an attached pdf in response to an email to his office and it is amazing. 
     Page 3-  he refutes the allegations of Dominion vote-flipping in Ware County and cites an apnews.com article as support. When checked the apnews.com article cites Raffensperger's office as its source.
           He also claims the allegations of Dominion vote-flipping have been debunked by ""elections officials, subject matter experts and fact-checkers"" (1)  And the source cited in this footnote?   www.dominionvoting.com.  ---That's right the Sec of State cites Dominion's own press releases as proof of the integrity of Dominion machines.
       Page 4- Raffensperger asserts the Dominion machines are safe and reliable because a certified audit (done by Pro V&V, Huntsville)  does indeed certify there is no other software loaded on the machines. ---So his assurance of integrity of the operational software is simply to prove there is no other third-party software loaded.

            Here he emphasized his office ""started"" hand audits with Cobb County because was it was the county that the president submitted the most ""relevant"" evidence of fraud.

@danielmacgibbon1589,"2020 recap:
CDC, WHO, Fauci all change their opinions on the effectiveness of masks and lockdowns every other week - state governors impose unconstitutional lockdowns regardless, shutting down small businesses while major chains get a free pass creating mass centralization of citizens that counters the recommendations for spreading out the populace - meanwhile, as mass riots, looting and violence are allowed to persist for months by state officials, cops allowed citizens and property to be assaulted by mass mobs but mace mothers at their children’s little league games for not wearing a mask - state and federal politicians repeatedly attempt to oppose and vilify the POTUS to avert focus on their own decades worth of REAL abuses of the People’s freedoms and although many are exposed, some many times over, no criminal cases are made, no one is held accountable for actual crimes that equal to treason, grand theft or real abuse of power, but on top of politicians being impervious to the laws that would incarcerate any other American citizen for lesser crimes, all news & social media conglomerates censor mass amounts of information and instead feed concocted, agenda-driven narratives to the People - during all this, ineffective federal agencies sit on criminal  evidence against corrupt politicians and made to be weaponized against political opponents are also exposed, again, with absolutely no repercussions... and the list goes on.  
And after no less than 5 decades of this, Federal and State career Politicians would rather point fingers (at the POTUS, at his supporters, at COVID, at the police, at the media, at radical groups, etc., etc.) than assume the responsibility that CLEARLY has always fell on their shoulders from the very start of them abandoning the will of the People instead choosing to pursue agendas and their own personal wealth. 

For these feckless politicians, the media, big tech and thinly veiled people’s rights organizations to act surprised and disgusted at the actions in DC on the Capital is truly insulting and unpatriotic. 
This event was not shocking, it was inevitable.
It was inevitable because it was intentionally created to lead up this. No conspiracy theory - it happened. Period. 
As far as our beloved government is concerned, it’s back to business as usual; whittling away essential freedoms of the American People.",0,2021-01-08T15:50:00Z,2021-01-08T15:50:00Z

@DiggerPat,"Yeah, see, here's the thing about the comparisons between the summer's Antifa/BLM violence and the riots on the 6th: the left blames Republicans and conservatives for both. They'll go on for hours about how radicalism on the left is just people reacting to their lives being threatened and how it's caused by stuff we did all while accusing us of not having enough self-awareness to take responsibility when something goes nuts on our side. It really is difficult to support continued work through the process when the other side actively despises you for literally any reason they can point at. 

At this point I've had enough of the ""you shouldn't be de-humanizing people"" group yelling about how I'm sub-human because of how I voted - verbatim, no exaggeration there - that I don't really care all that much if they just get stuffed.

@MrMurfle,"Kinda dumb analysis in some respects. What does it mean to not be responsible because you weren't the one who actually ""pulled the trigger"" or told someone to ""pull the trigger""?  Pretty meaningless definitional concept, especially when talking of highly influential people.
Why does he keep saying ""raise the temperature"" instead of, maybe, ""incite mayhem and violence"" or ""instigate sedition""? The former seems to have a significantly softer feel to me. Is that what he's wanting to convey?
I'm at a little over 30 minutes and he seems to have trouble laying anything really culpably serious -- but rather just a bit of stupidity and poor  judgment -- at the feet of the President and his enablers. As is often the case with Shapiro, he seems to me to have some biases, some rigid filters,  he's in some way unaware of or just refuses to acknowledge. I don't think he's as consistent or conceptually sound as he likes to think he is. That especially applies in the areas of political ideology and some theological issues.
On the other hand, he is generally worth listening to as long as you don't let him indoctrinate you into his pet intellectual constructs.

However, my frustration is who to believe and where to get trustworthy information. The MSM has its own inflammatory language. I watched all of the election hearings and the evidence appeared credible. The bigger issue here was the way the media portrayed and suppressed a difference of opinion by many good Americans calling them traitors and seditionists. There is no point, counterpoint with MSM. Only simplistic reporting and labeling. I hold MSM largely responsible and the dysfunctional relationship they have withTrump.

I think this is the right, who have peacefully protested typically, making the poor decision to use the tactics of the left because they realize that despite their cries and concern, they get no where. Instead, they get called crazy by the left and the right dont to the due diligence to calm the worries of their side.

Yes, Trump's words didn't help, but this event didn't happen in a vacuum. When the left defended rioting all last summer and even rewarded them over and over again, it makes perfect sense that the right is gonna adopt some of these tactics.

@nicolem2180,Ben I found you this year and you’re one of the reasons why I walked away from the democratic party. I did so because it because I believed it was the right thing to do. However I disagree with you on this. Stating that people believe that this election was rigged is an important fact senators and congress work for the people of the United States and the people of the United States want to be heard. They are not being heard in a court of law because there isn’t substantial evidence. While that might be fact that doesn’t mean that fraud did not occur because they were unable to find evidence of a larger scheme which is required for a fraud case. When you add up all the irregularities in all the different areas it indeed amounts to fraud. And so while we might not have evidence to prove it does not mean it did not happen. So the least that can happen is for the American people to see their representatives in Congress and in Senate objecting to the electors as the people wish and let the process play out. Whether or not they would’ve thrown out electors or whether or not it would’ve changed the vote does not matter. What matters is that the they work for the people and are supposed to be the voice of the people and that they see that the process is legitimate. I applaud the senators and congressmen who stood up invoiced for the people that they work for because that is what they are there to do regardless of their party affiliation.,0,2021-01-08T14:28:14Z,2021-01-08T14:28:14Z

@billparker244,"You seem to be ""going out of your way"" to downplay all of this.

""We have no evidence that the supreme court was presented with any evidence of fraud."" We didn't have any evidence that they WEREN'T either. Someone explain to me why they would present a case with zero evidence? I can look at some of that exact evidence right now on my computer: affidavits, videos, etc. It would be easy for Trump's lawyers to provide that evidence given that it's their profession. Evidence is just evidence. It doesn't prove an entire case without some context to it, but it's enough to open investigations and start the case up. This is how it works. 

McConnell saying ""we'd never see the whole nation accept an election again."" That's a current reality right now. Why would republicans vote ever again knowing the election is for sure rigged? We already had suspicions in the first place, along with evidence and convictions of people doing it to a lesser degree in the past.

I completely agree that we can't have separate sets of facts, but just agreeing with the left about everything to make it one set of facts isn't going to work either. That's complete nonsense.

The idea that if the election integrity was maintained and the real elected president stayed in office, that it would start a civil war is completely backwards. Because the evidence would have been heard in court, and a ruling made on the subject to reverse the corrupted result. But instead, we have tens of millions of people who know their vote wasn't valid, and they're pissed off about it. They're seeing before their eyes the effects of actual corruption and tyranny. 

To say that all the courts were not presented with any evidence has become that official's bias and point of view. I can also choose to not see this video even though I obviously am. See how that works?

I only got 23 minutes into the video before I had to stop. If you're going to just fall in line with the left because it hurts a little bit to go against them, then nothing you say is important.",0,2021-01-08T14:17:37Z,2021-01-08T14:17:37Z

Bottom line socialist have taken over the government against the will of at least 40% of the population. No one reviewed the evidence of any state anywhere.

When one city in one state says no we won’t obey the law it’s a wrap. The left destroyed America in 08 when Obama decided cafeteria law was the new way.  Take this leave that etc. to sit here and act like if the conservatives followed the law while the liberals do not is okay is also madness and a lie. Not one leftist has been held accountable in 12 years of corruption. This is why the riots happened. It will take more riots by actual patriots to violently remove the corrupt “ elected “ officials or it will never be a country again. The constitution was written by patriots that over threw a government that would not listen to them and rules against their values. Read the constitution, actually read it. That first section is what is happening. The majority of Americans don’t want the new Venezuelan government. They don’t want corruption, special interest groups a great reset, climate justice whatever that is. F ing pronouns ? 32 genders they use race theory which is the actual systemic racism in the country. The people will rise up again against it and the corrupt government will defend itself ( like the Torries and redcoats did ) and just like 1776 violence will be the only way to save the constitution. It is why the founding fathers write it in. They knew the people would have to fight against the governing parties because human nature is predictable and the Polesies and Schumer’s proved it yesterday.

The Democrats have so structurally changed the voting and ballot system in America that Republicans can never win the presidency from now on. They have no interest in discussing how to "" improve "" the voting process with Republicans, post pandemic or not .Georgia turned blue, Texas will in 5 years. This country will be unrecognizable in 4 years to those that still cherish the traditional values and processes. Part of the reason they elected Biden is they want to signal to the Republicans and any opposition that they, through the structural changes of voter fraud that they can literally elect anyone. Some argue that the events on Wednesday will give the Democrats additional narrative to attack Trump supporters.  Nonsense. Democrats demonstrate that if they dont have anything factual to argue with, they'll simply fabricate events to justify their actions.

@BHaidacher,"I am German Latin American lived mainly in Latin America. In my humble opinion you are looking at the obvious but not at the root of the problem. 

There is a scene in a very old Zorro Disney movie. The governor knew there was going to be unrest and a pacific demonstration. He paid one guy to throw a stone at him to enable him to use force against the demonstrators.

With the riots the fraud news became old news. All the left and the media focused on this and started attacking Trump.

I don't like Trump's style. I can understand his human behavior. He mad the mistake of turning everyone around him into a foe out of frustration. He has endured quite a lot and is used to be a one man show getting things done. 

The one foe he turned against him is the department of state that has no constituency and has perpetuated itself as the real power in the USA (World). By threatening to drain the swamp, all the creatures where aligned to one objective.

I have seen this many times in Latin America. The fraud, the political acceptance due to ""lack of evidence"" or courts case ""dismissals"". The USA has become a Banana Republic where the rule of law is applied depending on convenience. Where the ones who lie get ahead and no one dares to do anything. Where values and principles are for the stupid. The way to getting ahead is cheating.

Oh but wait... he doesnt exactly blame him, he just mentions that Trump's rhetoric is raising the temperature. True that; but what is the alternative? Bend over? 
But the fact that you think you are not blaming just because you are not saying it outright... that's whats so unnerving. Because in the end, it's just semantics. Your tone and the arrows of condemnation you fired are clearly for one target only.",0,2021-01-08T12:34:56Z,2021-01-08T12:34:56Z

@backedbythebible5557,Ben everything is not terrible and I would really urge you to get off the bandwagon of this rhetoric that the protest was the worst thing we've ever seen because we both know that that is not true. Historically for over 4 years or more every single Trump rally and protest has been primarily peaceful on our end and usually only ever escalates to violence when either black lives matter or antifa gets involved and yes I am a prominent supporter of trump and a conservative and a Christian and I believe that we are getting off track when we describe the events the way that you are in your show I think you're an excellent speaker and a great debater but you're not using logic in this sense you're using your emotion you're literally embarrassed for your party at this point and you need to stand with and be unified with this movement the election was clearly stolen the people who were there had every right to be there and we're not the ones who broke in and stormed the Capitol buildings that was antifa the Trump people were lured in there and some of them just like in every protest have a few people that are crazy they didn't burn anything down they didn't shoot anybody oh and then I remind you a innocent woman unarmed lost her life the least you can do when you're describing this historic event is put it in its correct context. I'm halfway tempted to call your show and debate you about this because I'm tired of listening to every single conservative news outlet act like this is the end of the world and Trump needs to be sent to prison. when the media narrative has been predominantly quiet about any antifa black lives matter protest violence people being you know beaten stabbed shot run over pulled out from their semi-truck to trailers why we never get a reaction like this from you.

Watching with great interest from the UK and - after the complexities and division Bexit creates ongoing - the civil unrest in the US is certainly a complex and explosive political issue. One thing - as it jars slightly with the intelligent and impartial content you always create (given your introductory 911 comparisons) - is that switching into advertising waffle machines and other goods feels like slightly poor form. Appreciate this element of your shows is an ongoing commercial enhancement for your channel, but perhaps on occasions such as this (in which the content is so poignant and powerful) one might forego the 'asides'. All for Capitalism, but the flip-flop feels disingenuous. Perhaps worth descriminating when, and in which episodes, product placements occur.

@vf5668,"This still doesn't beat the Russian Constitutional Crisis of 1993, when the election result was disputed between the government and Yeltsin. Russian government voted for the impeachment of Yeltsin. The population was divided, between the Sovietesque style of ruling by parliament, and Yeltsin, who people voted for anyway, during the collapse of the Soviet Union two years prior. Then, in the morning hours of October 4th, Yeltsin ordered then-Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to have his troops shell and storm the parliament, (known ironically as White House).

3 months after the lawmakers were arrested, and a new constitution was approved after the national referendum, giving the president huge legislative powers that Putin's office maintains to this day.

The biggest difference is that this happened in a new and weak Russia, and the effects of possible civil war could have been threatening to the world, but not on the scale of something similar happening in the US. I also feel that this event has immensely weakened the image of the US in the eyes of opponents like China, Russia, and even Iran. 

Glad that Trump has finally admitted defeat. Honestly, he could have played this situation so much better before, but also could have set himself to become a strong opposition member, uniting pretty much anyone who is, and will be dissatisfied with the upcoming government. Now the chances of that happening now are much lower, but still possible.",0,2021-01-08T11:15:31Z,2021-01-08T11:15:31Z

People could not vote on election day because someone filled out a ballot with their name on it. There is proof of more than 270,00 dead people that voted.

@yagsipcc287,"hahhaha 200 or 300 people acting like clowns is not that we had nearly 7 months of BLM and Antifa looting, burning, smashing businesses and even some homes (affordable housing in some areas) they set up autonomous zones and declared themselves their own states in these areas, they went around randomly beating people to half to death, dozens were killed. They attacked federal buildings, they tried to burn several down including court houses. This was praised by big corporations, many Politian's, famous people. But 200-300 clowns break down a door and smash some windows it's all hell breaking loose and the country has never seen this ever before. During supreme court hearings there were leftist who tired to break in and some did (but not into the main room) a couple years ago over 2000 people from the woman's march broke into I think it was the capital building or some other big federal building near by (can't remember what one off the top of my head) all of this was praised and excused by all media and many Politian's. I don't like either but I dislike double standards and this will make it worse way worse.

The other major point of confusion of course is the evidence of massive voter fraud.

@SupHapCak,"Okay... I don’t like you anymore. You’re pretty much just saying “I believe you believe that” but clearly they got to you or you just haven’t seen what we’ve seen. So many people said “give us the votes and we can prove forensically if they were made by machine or man, or if they’ve been creased ever, or if they were from dead or underage or fake voters” and they wouldn’t give up the votes to be investigated. After all this for you to sit there and say we don’t have the right... we may not have the legality but we have the right to ask questions and to receive answers. The secretary of state is the one who shouldn’t have the right to withhold potential evidence.
Seriously. Imagine a murder takes place, and they say “give us that knife we can show whose fingerprints and whose blood was on it” and the owner of the knife just has the power to say “no” and walk away, and the guy who called 911 is told “there was no murder, you’re crazy”. Not being able to put a name to the action doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. In any other case, this whole thing would be ridiculous. If you have people who want and are willing to investigate but you don’t let them, that isn’t evidence nothing happened. That is literally obstruction of justice.
I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed. I guess I thought you were actually an agent of truth but you’re in it for yourself like all the others.
Well it starts here. If whoever reads this got this far, in the future pick the candidate who supports policies you support instead of being loyal to one party or another.

Are you not doing your research anymore Ben? Since when are Trump supporters known to break things and starting riots? Trump said to go down the street to cheer on the republicans inside, not to break inside. I think he said it before in some tweets to meet in the capital to be loud outside while they congregate inside. They also blacked out Trump from communicating with his country's people.

@decimation5088,"I've watched many of Ben's videos, I've always been suspicious of him. He has some videos where he sounds like a constitutional genius, then he uploads this. The evidence of voter fraud is so overwhelming and hidden by the media. Fox News and Ben Shapiro aren't much different. They've both fell off the wagon. Even in political history, this is not even close to the worst. I'd recommend Steven Crowder, the Conservative Twins. AKA- The Hodge Twins, or Officer Tatum. Their videos are more accurate, as well as sometimes adding some comedy for viewers. I 110% think violence is unacceptable, however, when an election is being altered by fake news such as false Corona Virus claims, and inaccurate fake claims of systemic racism, and much voter fraud. People are going to be upset and angry. What else is expected of a corrupted election. While Ben Shapiro is correct about other topics, he's not a good source for the election. He has many good videos, but this one is simply just another waste of time. Everyone is acting like their wasn't just a bunch of BLM, and Antifa riots over false claims. Again, Violence is never okay. Also Trump saying the election was stolen is simply the truth. not a conspiracy, but a fact with much evidence. He rightfully said it was stolen. He wasn't lying or telling people to riot or commit acts of violence, even though the media makes it seem so. Do your own research, but, don't use google, it is corrupted and controlled with lots of censoring. DuckDuckGo is extremely reliable with no censoring and a growing popularity.

Acquiescence, is the worst possible thing any fair and legal minded person would do!
Pence was supposed ask the legislature to address what they refused to do.  There's nothing illegal about following a constitutional provided method to work out a seriously dubious electoral vote certification.  Yes, it would have been refused by the legislature and then sent for a congressional vote.  If the states wanted to honestly look into the enormous reports of voter fraud and allow an independent group of experts to investigate, then we all know the vote count would be invalidated and not correctable.
There was no separate set of facts permitted!  That was the whole point of this outrageous event.

The flaw is that politicians need money for campaign ads and major corporations tend to have the money necessary to fund those ads.

I come here to watch Ben's cultural takes and I agree 60% of the time. But this video is proof that he needs to either get out of the way or join the new movement. His hysteria and pearl clutching and swift disavowal anytime that conservatives finally do something wrong after the hundreds of wrongs by the opposition is hilarious. It's okay for him to call out the right, and he should, but the energy he has here was never used for when, for example, sixth months of left wing riots rampaged across America. His view of the game that is being played is not rooted in reality at all. He thinks it's Monopoly when it's actually Risk. He thinks that we should still worry about optics and civility and politeness against an enemy that wants us all dead (and even ""unwoke"" ""problematic"" people on the left). He thinks that tax cuts for the rich and less bureaucratic red tape are a winning strategy, and anything to preserve the culture is out of line with government's powers. Yet he doesn't seem to realize that the left doesn't give a shit about government power, and that people are VOTING FOR THEM. And we can't change their minds because we'll be censored. And censorship is the free market, dummy. His so-called principled approach allows nothing more than for its adherents to have a misplaced sense of pride and dignity as the country burns to the ground and they're on the way to their gulags.

@BricksAndSparrows,"Watching what happened yesterday didn't upset me half as much as watching rioters tear through shops and neighborhoods of people who may well have supported their political agenda. And the reason why is because what happened yesterday was chaotic and stupid, but it wasn't MEAN. We have watched riot after riot this year, perpetrated against innocent citizens by sanctimonious children who claimed to care about the communities they were ripping apart and setting on fire. That was cruel and mean and ruthless. Capitol Hill was back up and running in a matter of hours. Some of the communities that suffered through BLM and Antifa still haven't recovered and there are certainly business owners that never will. Criminals are criminals, and should be prosecuted but we make distinctions based on the viciousness of the crime.

Jimmy Fallon's shaken response last night, or Colbert asking Sen. Klobuchar, ""Are you okay?"" Not one ounce of this concern was extended to the communities that suffered this year. No. Instead they were told ""this is what protest is supposed to look like."" Fuck. You. Leftists bailed rioters out of jail while politicians and the media gave them cover by saying the malevolence was really only a small percentage of the ""protesters,"" and what we really needed to be worried about was police brutality. If Trump and Giuliani had managed to steal the election after Biden had won, you can be sure Antifa would have done the same thing at the Capitol. The only difference is that they would still be there, the hashtag OccupyDC would be trending on Twitter and the media would be hailing them as courageous freedom fighters.

You can call this a ""what-about-ism"" but the fact is, what happened yesterday cannot be erased. However if we don't stop alienating people, and the Left doesn't quit with the double standards, this will continue to happen.",0,2021-01-08T07:41:53Z,2021-01-08T07:41:53Z

I will unsubscribe. It’s too bad, I like your delivery style. 

I will always agree with you on this, “facts don’t care about your feelings.” 

Your emotional attachment for a narrative you wish to be true doesn’t change the obvious fraud that gave Joe Biden 80 million votes, the most votes for anyone in history. That is a lie. If you believe that then you are part of the problem. Too bad, but I will not be part of your psychosis.

Top that off with 335 simultaneous lawsuits used to subvert the Constitution of the state legislators using the executive branch of each state and the judicial branch of each state unconstitutionally to change election law at the last minute to help preferred candidate...

I can't think of a more well-thought-out plan even if I wanted to to keep one group of the American people completely unaware or misinformed while simultaneously handing them ballots without solicitation telling them to vote for a candidate as you are doing that to subvert a free election..

@KevinSmith-oz5em,"I typically agree with what you have to say Ben, but here I could not disagree more. I do not know how you can say they do not have proof the Georgia (my state)  electorial was stollen. There was footage released of 4 giant suitcases of ballots being brought in and counted. This is just one of the examples. The ONLY reason they may not have been able to prove it is because the people who they had to go through to get evidence were involved in the scandal. However, the many many hours of testimonies describing the horrible treatment of poll watchers is enough to fuel these people being fed up with this treatment. I do agree that the protests should not have taken the violent turn they did. Trump definitely fueled it, but he was screwed out of his presidency. He has every right to be pissed off,; unfortunately, he isn't all that smart, so his reaction has been a little irrational. Media manipulation, as well as some help from the states changing laws at the last minute and throwing out/changing votes, caused a Biden ""victory."" Why do you think they have not allowed Trump's attorneys access to all of the Dominion voting machines. The courts did not want to even hear the arguments; this is due in large part that they have personal biases against Trump, or in the other cases they feared what would happen if it were actually overturned. It would definitely set the masses of devout CNN followers off. It is sad it has come to this.  Sure some of the rioters are ""Trumpers,"" but this is much bigger than trump. This is our democracy, and it is practically non-existent at this point. Anyone who thinks we have a free democracy,  you are a part of the mass i mention is manipulated. 

You (Ben) making it seem as though everyone should just ""accept the outcome,"" which anyone with a drop of sense can see our votes no longer matter, is the equivalent of saying ""lay down and accept this dictatorship as it pushes more and more towards the point of no return,"" assuming it is not past that threshold. 

For them to make this about race is ludicrous. What else would you expect from the left though? To compare it to the BLM riots, where cities were shut down for days to weeks, and many buildings burnt- people's livelihoods stripped from therm. Making this clear, I am not condoning what these people did a couple of days ago, but it is bs to try and say this was about race or the fact the police were slow to act had anything to do with race. Not only are not all republicans responsible, but not all of the protesters responsible. Yes, many of them acted with disregard of human life and laws, but a lot of them were peacefully protesting (e.g. not storming the capitol of destroying property)

Finally, about what Obama said... why the fuck is he even relevant? Obaman is, even after Trump has ended his presidency in a negative light, and a terrible year caused by this stupid virus (heightened by the media),  the worst president of my lifetime, and he literally only opens his mouth to make waves.

If you are going to be a part of the daily wires news channel, you should probably be less opinionated. Sure on your show, it's fine I guess, since it's the Ben Shapiro show, but if you are involved in a real newscast- just something to consider.

When looking for clear explanations of conservative viewpoints as I mentioned above, I view Ben as the #1 source of conservative commentary, comparable to Pakman but of course on the conservative side of politics.

This is by far the best episode of the Ben Shapiro Show I have seen. Your closing speech/monologue thing is especially what does it for me (beginning around 1:06:15). The sentiment you lay out here is one that everyone needs to understand, and GOD DAMN do I wish that the clear understanding of this concept was more widespread. Until organizations like Fox News and MSNBC stop portraying fellow Americans with opposing viewpoints as the enemy, I fear that dark days like yesterday may only be just the beginning.

I know I may get flogged in replies for daring to tread here as a Democrat (or maybe not, I know nothing about the Daily Wire community). But I just wanted to stop in and commend Ben for this episode of the podcast. I know my comment will probably be buried and my single comment doesn't matter all that much, but Ben is treated pretty unfairly by the left and just want y'all to know that some of us appreciate his work and this show.",37,2021-01-08T06:44:49Z,2021-01-08T06:44:49Z

Biden sure as hell won’t follow Trump’s footsteps, the best he would do is to make worthless calls to Xi Winnie and that will be all, he’ll continue to make business with the CCP, he’ll continue to feed the CCP with American technology and academic institutions, China will rule America.

@theledge9293,"Ben, I agree with your opinions about 90% of the time and I research your facts and typically find no argument with them.  However, Most of your opinions in this video are shocking, sad, and borderline inflammatory.  I’m a conservative, a social media non-participant and I’m not a Trump personality fan.  Trump will win no popularity contest with me but his results, given the circumstances, are undeniable.  

Conservatives are not benevolent beings that should be held to some unrealistic higher standard by others.  They are a flaw and imperfect people like anyone else with the difference being their firm grip on the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the United States that they believe are the only things that separate us from the tyranny that suppresses and oppresses the rest of the world.  You are not the only public personality that is saying this is one of the worst days in recent American history and you are not the only person I believe is wrong in saying so.  I would argue that all of America’s darkest hours have come when acts of tyranny and acts of terrorism were brought upon the people of the United States of America.  This riot at the Capital was neither an act of tyranny nor terrorism.  What happened at the Capital is terrifying but lambasting it as one of the worst days in American history is foolish.  A protest gone wrong, yes.  A sad day that leaves us with more questions than answers, yes.  I am horrified to learn of the deaths and injuries that occurred and I do not condone the acts that lead to them.  

Your knowledge of legal precedent far exceeds my own, however, my guess is that if the Sons of Liberty had taken their grievances of the Tea Act to the courts they would have been told they have no proof and no legal standing.  When the courts are filled with Kangaroos not every grievance can be laid at their feet.  Calling the riot at the Capital one of the worst days in American history, downplays the truly horrible crimes committed against the American public nearly every year that I would argue are much worse days on a national level than this day.  

This video feels like an hour long opinionated scolding of Trump and anyone feeling disenfranchised about the results of the election with happy advertising bits sprinkled in.  Your show, do what you want.  I’ll make my leave.",2,2021-01-08T05:09:02Z,2021-01-08T05:09:02Z

@leotaylor2814,"Everyone is responsible for this, and the Democrats are only fueling it by calling the protestors traitors and trying to attempt a coup.  What they are saying loud and clear is liberals and Democrats can burn our cities, loot our businesses, and assault people and that is okay but when people on the right do it then those people are traitors.  I agree with Biden's condemnation of the violence, and  it is not going unnoticed that he took months to condemn the violence from BLM and only did it after the Wisconsin polls showed the riots hurting his chances of election.  

I disagree with Ben on one main point.  When you have 39% of the population believing this election was fraudulent and the response by the political ruling class is basically ""Suck it up"" then they share responsibility in this anger. That is what protests are about. When citizens see the system fail them they march. (blacks, whites, asians, laborers, women, etc)    All our leaders failed us in this.  They could have taken the time over the last few months to address the legitimate concerns of the voters. Instead we had the media pound the wore ""Baseless"" so much that I have seen it used in news reports from Israel. All the while we are witnessing States that eviscerated their signature laws,  got caught on video counting ballots at night after poll watchers left,  kicked out poll watchers, and lists of thousands of questionable votes that could easily sway the election. (eg, dead people, people moved out of State, voters registered to vacant lots)   If everyone had calmed down, if the media had played it straight, if we could have taken the time to answer these questions and appease people then we would not be here.  And yes, we would not have appeased everyone but 90% would have been great.    

This fiasco was handled badly by everyone and everyone needs to take the blame, take a deep breath, and move forward.  A good starting point would be for our leaders to all accept responsibility and then take one major step.  If they want us to have faith in our election system then give us an election system to have faith in.  As it stands they are asking for faith much as a religion does. Just have faith and don't question.  If we did that with the airline industry then air travel would not be the safest form of travel.",0,2021-01-08T05:06:43Z,2021-01-08T05:06:43Z
@icouce,"I've just about had it with the sanctimony and posturing.

Liberals obviously don't understand Republicans or what a conservative is. A conservative is a person who wants the transparency that Democrats are always yammering about but never deliver. They are people who want transparency in our election system. They are people who never want to be told by their government at any level, ""No, you can't audit that vote."" They are people who do not want to predetermine the result. They just want to have faith in the outcome.

Yes they would prefer President Trump, but I'll bet you real American dollars that you cannot find a registered Republican who would say Trump should stay even if they were sure Biden won. On the other hand the Democrats applauded as their leadership fraudulently used the country's secret police to try to depose the duly elected president of United States!

These protests the Democrats and others are now hurrumphimg about, are just a tap on the shoulder. Conservatives will give you as pass this time. President Biden will be inaugurated, and he will represent me. But know this: If in 2024 or hell, if in 2018 the media and the political establishment is again telling us we ""cannot audit the voting software because it's proprietary,"" or we cannot verify signatures or we cannot audit one vote, then game on! 

To President-elect Biden: A great President of a great country does not leave half the population doubting his legitimacy. We found a great big bug in the system. This is your number one priority bar none. I don't want to hear a peep about immigration or climate change.or anything else, until the American people have an auditable, transparent election system.

@patricktilton5377,"At the 56-minute mark, you say that JFK was killed by a communist. The vast majority of Americans don't believe the conclusions of the Warren Report -- that Oswald was a commie who acted alone, blah blah blah. There are literally thousands of books of varying degrees of professionalism and scholarship that have been written about the Kennedy murder -- which wouldn't be the case if it was as cut-and-dried as your comment suggests. The majority of Americans believe that the CIA had more than a little to do with it, as Kennedy had vowed to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces. They just got to him first, and they framed one of their assets for the murder -- the sheep-dipped agent whom they could place on the chessboard in the Texas Schoolbook Depository so that planted evidence could implicate him. As Oswald was murdered while in police custody -- and therefore never had an opportunity to defend himself in a court-of-law -- it is disgusting that posterity should tar him with the brush of historical ignominy. I'm not saying he was a saint -- his involvement in the CIA-sponsored creation of a fast-acting cancer to be used in an attempt to kill Castro being less-than-saintly [see Judith Vary Baker's book ""LEE & ME""] -- but he didn't shoot ANYBODY on 22 November 1963. He wasn't even on the 6th Floor of the TSBD -- he couldn't have been, as two women descending the only stairwell at the time he would've had to be doing so said in testimony to the Warren Commission, as he was seen by the building manager and a police officer within 90 seconds of the shooting on the 2nd Floor.

I cant fathom having any higher taxes ( I am forced to live in cali, court order custody arrangement) for student loan forgiveness when i never dug that hole.

The original Americans slaughtered the native people that were here before they arrived. The original Americans killed each other in a civil war. 

To say that violence is not being American is nonsense. 

As far as the courts are concerned none of them have heard any evidence. From what I have seen and heard the courts keep passing the hot potato.

Just because a politician claims there is no evidence of enough fraud to overturn the election doesn’t mean anything. They all lie. My proof is AOC. As long as that naive immature airhead is a congress person none of them have any credibility. Why would anyone take the word of AOC on anything? She has lived a sheltered life.

@johnadams3418,"This is why I ultimately say f**k Trump.  I was surprised at how conservatively he governed and was more than happy to vote for him in 2020.  That said, it is 100% his fault that he lost this election.  Had he made Biden and his colleagues the center of attention during the election, he wins easily.  Instead he had to be the center of attention and make gaff after gaff which allowed Biden and the media to make up the difference.  Then he costs the senate by stroking his own ego which shows that despite any of the good in his governance, it was for his own aggrandizement and not true Conservative principles.  He allowed Biden to take the Presidency and then the Democrats to take Senate which threatens to undo all of his accomplishments because he cannot swallow his God DAMN pride and do what is best for his country and legacy.  I only hope other Republicans take the lessons of Trump and realize that being squishes that shy away from all conflict is a losing strategy and more effectively focus their fights to where it is necessary.",1,2021-01-08T04:07:24Z,2021-01-08T04:07:24Z

@TheDatabaseDude,"Ben always talks about the superiority of of the US Constitution and there's little argument that it's a wonderfully written document reflecting some of the greatest thinkers in political history.  But as Justice Scalia pointed out in one of his speeches, the Soviet Constitution provided for even more human rights and protections for the common man.  -  And what good did that document do for the Russian people?  It was just words on a page.

Now, lets compare the USA with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.  Like the USA they all inherited English Common Law as the basis of their societies. The concepts of Rule of Law, Separation of the Judiciary from the Government, and the idea that no one is above the law,    have created societies that have one thing in common - Namely an immigration problem.  More people want to immigrate to them than they are prepared to handle.  These are the countries that people want to move to.  So obviously, English Common Law which started with Magna Carta in 1215 and was designed to evolve has proven itself to be a good system. 

But in addition to English Common Law, the USA also has the US Constitution with all it's checks and balances while Britain and the other former colonies who got their independence a century after the USA are stuck with the older and supposedly  inferior Westminster System of Parliamentary Democracy.  So why is it that compared to the USA, the streets are safer, and human rights have historically been better in Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand?

My take is that the USA was born into the idea that if you don't like what the government is doing, then it is your right - even your patriotic duty - to pick up a gun and do something about it.  The gun laws of the USA where supposedly designed so that an armed population could resist any  future government tyranny.  The history books glorify the revolution.  And what was the terrible tyranny that they so gloriously rebelled against?  Taxes on Tea?  This wasn't exactly the Gestapo.  Indeed the greatest single flood of immigration into Canada in history where ""Empire Loyalists"" -  People from the former American Colonies who thought that the idea of revolution was just too left wing and radical for them.  These people where so determined not to be part of the USA that when the USA invaded Canada four times between 1812 and 1814 to try to make Canada part of the USA, these same Empire Loyalists fought very hard and defeated the American Armies to stay out of the USA, even though they where outnumbered 8 to 1.

Yesterday we saw this situation playing out.  The people who stormed the Capital don't consider themselves Terrorists.  They consider themselves patriots in the spirit of 1776.  The worrying thing is that they are not a small minority.   While Trump lost the election, he still got over 45% of the vote and as many of them said, ""This Ain't Over Yet"" .  The  people who where arrested and will probably go to jail will become martyrs to the cause.  January 20th isn't going to change any of this.  And in a country where it's easier to legally get a license to own an assault rifle than to get a drivers license, we have a potentially very dangerous situation simmering.",1,2021-01-08T03:38:03Z,2021-01-08T03:38:03Z

@titsinkuen,"Congress has the power to institute a vote of delegates to the House, in which there'd have been a Republican majority. And the election WAS stolen, with unprecedented counts of widespread fraud as well as governors and secretaries of state unconstitutionally changing the rules. There is video evidence, which, among other crimes, shows a ballot counter processing the same batch numerous times, and Dominion was rigged to isolate the registered voters who didn't vote in this election and to vote for Biden in their names. Nearly 11,000 dead people voted in the Nov 3 election in Georgia; the margin of victory was 10,000 Biden over Trump even after the 3 am dump of over 120,000 votes that were due to the activities shown on the video footage. Ballots in several swing states were processed with no names or addresses, and others with invalid addresses such as closed businesses or vacant lots. People received three and four ballots by mail, sometimes in their names, sometimes in the names of people who'd moved or passed. The ones who didn't use these extra ballots to vote more than once were the ones who reported them. Who knows what the others did with them, and it should at least have been investigated before certification, because it was enough to overturn the election. Any one of these areas of fraud would've been enough to see Trump win, and there are more instances still. Trump won the election; the Democrats stole it. Including at the rally on Jan 6, Trump did or said nothing misleading or inciting. Shameful reporting here, Ben. No excuse for it.",0,2021-01-08T03:36:44Z,2021-01-08T03:36:44Z

@Justhangingout90,"So speaking of damaging narratives. ""Liberal Media, conniving, manipulative entity conjuring up lies and twisted narratives about republicans"" As though republican media (including you, Ben) aren't creating your own screwy narratives. 

Let's be clear. Trump has been totally transparent about who he is. None of this should be a surprise to you. If you are a republican who voted for trump, and have not for the last 4 years, outwardly and passionately condemned Trump's divisive and hateful rhetoric up until this point, then yes, you are responsible for allowing the ""temperature to rise"". Truly, this whole Pontius Pilate, ""I wash my hands of this"" bit is beneath you. 

Also, It's the American people making this about race and calling out the double standards here. Double standards that are glaringly obvious, a double standard you even pointed out by drawing a comparison between how Trump treated BLM rioters to how he treated well...his rioters.  And yes, police also, were WAY more gentle towards these trump-loving rioters then they were with BLM rioters, regardless of how unprepared they were. Just look back in time. Watch the evidence, Ben. 

But sure, just keep condemning democrats for always making stuff about race. Cuz that's your card.

Side note: The ""liberal media"" are a collection of Americans who share their opinions with other Americans, and it is Americans who are agreeing with them.  Americans are creating these narratives. And it's the narratives that the American people collectively agree with that will circulate and stick around for the next decade. You are creating a narrative too, Ben. So sick of you blaming the media . Who you're really blaming are Americans. And really it's just a ""small percentage"" of them who are intentionally spinning a web of lies. 

(Ben loves to use percentages and fails to acknowledge that what he sees as a small percentage is actually thousands of people. Thousands of black Americans have faced police brutality. So don't diminish them by turning them into a ""small percentage"".)",0,2021-01-08T03:31:12Z,2021-01-08T05:38:34Z

Such a shame that you don't even see how the justice system which is meant to address these kinds of issues doesn't reach a single evidentiary phase to go over the claims and evidence on hand. You're talking just like the media now. Undermining many credible people's testimonies and more importantly, the fact that state public officials (no matter the party) unconstitutionally changed the guidelines for voting. I ask you, does the ""law"" you so much like to cite and follow not matter anymore?

You just sound like the media now. Forget the ""absent"" fraud, protocols were not followed, the system is in place for a reason. Are you okay with ""dead"" people voting?

@schurging22,"""Violence bad, apathy good."" -Shapiro 2021

TL;DR Expect the continued rise of the autonomous individual through decentralization as institutions continue to fail to uphold their duties and play power games. Liberty will never die, it just may leave the US behind.

Convenient to demonize people who have suffered, been ignored, and lost most of what they had in a single year.

Meanwhile, illegal court handing out voting law, illegal bans on congregation, illegal bans on ability to open businesses, evidence dismissed on procedure/precedent but openly argued meritless, attempted coup on sitting President on meritless accusations over 4 years but accusations with merit in 1 year concerning defending SAME president ignored, procedural blocking then arguing procedure not followed, demonizing political supporters of president to openly escalate violence on social media platforms, defending from said violence prosecuted while initiated violence charges dropped, and rights continue to be shrunk and ""interpreted"" from the Constitution.

But somehow....storming the capital because leaders clearly favor one political group over another..... THAT'S where this went too far. What a spineless generation to live in. Where ALLLLL forms of action are labeled as ""extremist behavior"" by side-liners like Shapiro.

I would have thought being a religious Jew the bans on religious congregation would go too far even for you..... But again.... something you thought acceptable since government is now in the business of health laws via covid? Something that has started wars previously, the banning of religious practice...... Or is that another ""rule for thee and not for me"" kind of thing?

While we are often critical of American policy, there is a truth which I feel I must articulate here as a foriegner (I live in Canada): the free world does look to American Democracy as a beacon of freedom.  While I dont agree with everything that Reagan said, I really feel that America is the shining city on the hill. A global defender of freedom. Thus, the way I see it, the attack on the capital,  was an attack on the heart of the symbol of freedom for the world.

Love it or hate it, for many of us in the free world, American success is our success. We all have a deep rooted vested interest in the health, vibrancy, and success of the American experiment.  This is so true that we must view their success as our success.

@andrewstewart7140,"Sadly Ben is out of touch with everything that has been going on the past month. It’s not true that courts saw the evidence, most were thrown out on procedural and standing issues. 

The little opportunity for evidence to be heard had actual established fact that the various state laws were violated like crazy, even to degrees that would have overturned things,  but no one wants to make that hard decision. That and you don’t have full conservative judges overseeing trials.

The Supreme Court required the Chief Justice to hear the evidence and he refused. Then you did have legislative branches coming around like Pennsylvania and Georgia saying please give us more time. It wasn’t that the legislative branches all rejected.

Everything that happened at the Capitol yesterday is condemnable. But it was a small minority of those who are contesting that acted that way. Talk to people who were actually there NOT the clips Ben has from the main stream media.

And Trump has said VERY little relative to what the grass roots populist movement has been whipping up because NO one will actually sit down and hear the evidence.

A lot of the people were antifa. I’m 💯 on condemning the criminal actions at the Capitol.

Then don't want to be rioted, Ben, if they can make excuses to not hear the cases to begin with, and not even the likes of you will scrutinize them for it. The state legislatures lacked procedural means. They are large, cumbersome bodies. Pence could have given them the mandate to convene and vote to clarify their will on the electors. That wouldn't be disenfranchising anyone. It would be enfranchising everyone more. Everyone's vote combined to make the tally close enough to doubt under the circumstances, and everyone's vote is represented in the composition of the state legislature, more granularly than it is anywhere else on the state or federal levels.",15,2021-01-08T02:25:56Z,2021-01-08T02:25:56Z

@hebrews1115,"I normally admire your unemotional and candid arguments focused on facts.  But you and I haven’t truly been allowed to see the facts.  If we can’t acknowledge the information warfare within our own borders, pray tell what hope without. Seriously, turn off the mainstream and look under hood.  Too much photo shopping and editorial pandering on both sides.  The Civil Courts rejected the cases on standing - not merit. No witnesses / evidence presented / examination and cross examinations occurred.  They punted the hot potato across 2 branches and only the executive branch fought. Solely self-serving? depends on your aisle - I think not.  Election integrity is our hill, and once lost the narrative that binds is lost.  Their wasn’t time on the clock for criminal proceedings.  If healing is desired, that will occur now - including against the few who crossed the line yesterday.  Not a 100 day siege on a city, but wrong nonetheless.  Don’t sensationalize it.  I educated myself and actively participated in elections this year and saw concerning events and clear opportunities for acts counter to our democratic republic.  Outcome determinative? That’s for the courts and experts to determine - but appointments to either the judicial bench or congressional chair doesn’t appear to infuse a spine.  They are under pressure and unfortunately threatened.  Let’s protect them but to whom much is give, much is required.  Sad day indeed, acknowledge, but the ignition or response to it doesn’t dissipate the tender.   I stood in third world countries defending their right to vote, we simply ask we protect it here.

- 1 high court judge (talking about voter fraud) was blackmailed by ANTIFA, after they sent him pictures of his daughters high school. 
- 2 major American cities and 2 states were taken over by ANTIFA and BLM, who then proceeded to harass, rape (yes, rape) and murder citizens that refused to comply with CHAZ/CHOP

@jasonallen5318,"I'm sorry, but this video is waaay off base here. First off, what happened on Captitol Hill is in no way, shape, or form, the worst day in our history, ultimately only 4 people died, 3 most likely on accident falling from a ledge. This barely scratches the surface of the worst day. What most pundits are calling ""insurrectionists"" and an act of ""sedition"", well the flip side is that the people occupying a building that WE THE PEOPLE own, were in fact enacting on a Revolutionary movement to upend an inherintly corrupt system of failing politicians who are playing a very dangerous game with real world consequences. Our Founding Fathers apparently engaged in ""Insurrection & Sedition"" when we took our rights and our Country from the Redcoats...sometimes drastic measures call for extreme actions, especially when our own Government is not serving the will of the people. We the People should have a voice and we the people are being denied an honest election, anyone with half a brain cell and two eyes can see that this was very blatantly fixed. Where's the proof? There's TONS OF PROOF, why are you being so blindly ignorant of the truth? Why has there not been any ballot auditing? Why are the Dominion machines being wiped clean and hidden away from investigation? Why are all the Courts throwing out countless suits alleging voter fraud? You do realize there's hundreds of individual sworn testimony under penalty of perjury from different individuals claiming improper voting procedures in one way or another across all of the contested states, right? You do know, that statistical data analysis alone proves without a shadow of a doubt that Biden had no chance of winning when magically, all the contested states stopped counting votes, and then got harvested ballot dumps that were basically 90%+ all for Biden. Statistically inprobable & impossible way beyond a reasonable doubt, even a heavy doubt, especially when you learn that many counties had quite a bit more votes than registered voters, Georgia alone had 4% down ballot voting all for Biden (totally not suspicious at all), and lets not forget that when compared with Hillary Clinton on the previous election, Hillary outperformed Biden in every major city across the US except for 4, all of which were in each of the contested states. If that's not ""proof"" of widespread voter fraud then you are either being willfully ignorant or can't see the forest for the trees.

@skate7destroy1,"Hey, a politician who finally denounced political violence.  Funny how the liberal media and the ANTIFA apologists and cheerleaders who refused to condemn violent attacks against Trump supporters, police officers, small business owners, and national monuments with statements such as ""where does it say that protests have to be peaceful "", are now suddenly very supportive of law and order. It's almost as if these very people who were only weeks ago calling for the defunding and eradication of law enforcement agencies from coast to coast, are now demanding they work harder to arrest and jail those conservatives who for years were being slandered as the racist deplorable supporters of our illegitimate President.  Funny how in the end history will be left remembering that despite a stolen election and widespread criminal corruption from the anti-TRUMP media and political partisans with their fake investigations, manufacturered impeachment hearings, and rigged election, that it was actually President Trump who contested the fradulant corrupt election and did what Democrats were too cowardly to do, which was to denounce political violence.  In the end it was Donald Trump who took the high road despite being conspired against from every institution in America.  All for the American people.  We the people have fully given up on the idea of free and fair elections.  We have given up on equal treatment under the law.  We have watched violent leftists become celebrated as they destroyed the lives of law abiding Americans.  We now know better that phrases like ""the people's house"" and ""public servants"" are simply manipulative ways our corrupt rulers keep us complacent through the ILLUSION of power.  Our votes aren't even real.  Our voices aren't even defended.  Our courts intimidated by threats of violence by anti-American ANTIFA anarchists, refuse to even hear the overwhelming evidence of widespread voter fraud and unconstitutional rule changes in the days before an election.  We've learned we really are nothing to the political elite.  We represent nothing more than inconvenient citizens who they must pretend to represent for a well paying jobs writing the very laws that they don't follow w themselves when they're inconvenient and they do so with impunity.  We real ze that we have no power, yet are held to standards that they themselves refuse to live by.  Criminal charges for minor crimes by average Americans are prosecuted en masse, while the actual crimes by our elected law makers never seem to be by held accountable.  Yet when the people have finally had enough of being invisible and forgotten, and dare do something as unforgiving as enter the sacred United States Capitol, we're accused of sedition.  So much for all that non-sense we've been taught about patriotic Americans who've risen up against tyranny and tyrannical leaders as being a patriotic duty of Americans.  That's now clearly been exposed as a myth, just like our vote having any meaningful value whatsoever.  It's all an illusion and a lie meant to distract us with the illusion of having a say in our government.  When small business owners have their businesses burned to the ground and their life savings destroyed forever, they barely notice.  However when we the people dare occupy our house, the US Capitol for an hour, these political elites, our so called ""public servants"" self righteously condemn and chastise the people for daring to speak up and take a stand.  So we've heard you in Washington DC, and we've heard you loud and clear.  There's no needing to pretend any longer who you consider the real enemy.  We appreciate all  you cowards were too afraid to do at the possibility that it might hurt you politically, a g ain't those who cheer their militia t supprters on when they're pursuing their political agendas.

@bldgy,"Im about done with daily wire. At this point I see little difference between them and legacy media.

Legacy media constantly attributes everything conservatives want or believe to racism, sexism, or some other form of ism or phobia.

The majority of the hosts on the daily wire are attributing the rejection of this election to conservatives just not liking the outcome of the election. Ben, try shutting your mouth for 5 seconds and listening to what people are saying. I don't need you shoving your words into my mouth any more than I need legacy media doing it.

We were lied to and told counting was going to stop, but it resumed after vote monitors left on the night of the election. Some Republican monitors reported that they returned to the counting centers and found people counting, but the counting centers initially claimed that was false. Finally they admitted that they had continued counting, but claimed that every media member and every vote monitor in Democrat controlled counting centers in every swing state across the country misunderstood and had never been told that the centers were shutting down. Maybe Ben Shapiro believes this, but I'm just not that gullible.

Then republican vote monitors were kicked back out of counting centers due to covid, or forced to stand so far away that they couldn't see. During the times republicans were not in the voting centers, the vote count swung wildly in favor of Biden. Maybe Ben is ok with republicans being kicked out of counting centers every god-damned election moving forward and sees nothing suspicious about it, but I am not that gullible.

That in and of itself is enough to call the election into question without the other blatant things Democrats did that destroyed people's faith in elections. Stop flagellating conservatives for being suspicious. The fault lies solely with the Democrats who pulled the shady antics. Something ben seems oddly OK with.

You keep saying there is no wide spread voter fraud and asserting that voter fraud on that level just isn't possible. Im don't know why it is so hard to grasp that when you ignore the safeguards against voter fraud, it makes it possible to commit voter fraud on a massive scale.

As you have pointed out repeatedly, it is extremely hard to prove voter fraud. It is even more so when there are no damned safeguards to make it harder to commit. Again, this doesn't seem particularly complex.

I get it. You want to roll over and swear that the election was legitimate.I assume you will defend republicans being kicked out of counting centers in every election going forward. That's fine. At least have the basic decency to acknowledge that others don't agree with you and that they believe there was voter fraud. Stop asserting that this is all some trantrum because the election didn't go our way.

Daily wire will never see a cent from me as long as the hosts continue to misconstrue the viewpoints of other conservatives. I get enough of that from the legacy media. Im not paying to get it from you.",0,2021-01-08T01:42:51Z,2021-01-08T01:42:51Z

@TaraHower,"This has to be the most disappointing video on YouTube. You have to take into account that the barricades were opened by police. There is video proof. People are fed up and it’s not based on thought or feelings of election fraud it’s based on video evidence. This evidence was played and read off on the daily wire as well. I’m really disappointed that you would let that msm rhetoric of this event being, “almost as bad as 9/11,” trickle into your video.. what about the actual lawlessness that was displayed this past year by antifa and blm on the basis of a video that wasn’t telling the whole story because the lying media was irresponsible in how they presented the George Floyd footage as well as playing into a straight up white bad Donald trump bad black and brown people victimhood bias. There was clearly something fishy going on.. at least there were no buildings burned. There have already been photos submitted online of antifa members disguised as trump supporters. I firmly believe antifa led this and some trump supporters followed. But from videos I saw the police were not equipped and that was quite suspect. What an atrocity that we couldn’t even have the voter fraud claims investigated and now Donald trump is solely responsible even though his video directly condemned the violence. Joe Biden never condemned antifa and referred to them as an idea rather than a group.

I hope every person that flipped on Trump yesterday NEVER gets re-elected. Lindsay Graham showboating and washing his hands was particularly disingenuous. Loeffler never deserved the seat - good riddance. I will forever respect Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Gaetz & others for following their convictions - and evidence. Of course the sh/t cancel culture has them in a noose now. I pray that God upholds them.

They nailed Trump to a cross his entire presidency and yesterday, in my opinion, was a coordinated effort between Big Tech, MSM, and very likely Antifa, to have the last word in the narrative.

@davidkahn3569,"Ben.
It appears you don't see what's happening here.  You now say that there was no issue with the elections, because no cases have been won. That's not how the truth is defined.  There are other reasons why these cases are bot even being heard and the evidence is not even looked at by the judges.  I heard that one judge reported privately that his life has been threatened. Judges don't want to be involved in rhe whole election issue so they have been coming up with reasons not to hear cases. Some might have been bribed or blackmailed. At any rate your statement that there is no evidence of election fraud is false and you should be informed enough to know that. So what's really going on with you?
Here is some evidence you might have forgotten.
Drop boxes were left out on street corners where people could drop ballots into. That's completely illegal.  Ballots have something required by law called ""chain of custody"".  Those many thousands of ballots had none.  
Many other laws were broken. Legal action made no difference.  Republican vote watchers were not allowed to watch the counting. There are hundreds of people who went in record with sworn testimonies witnesses to massive violations. You've already discounted them all, have you? Think they can't possibly make a difference?  
Since you think all claims of potential fraud have been debunked, would you mind explaining why 439,000 votes were subtracted from Trump's count in Pennsylvania?  And  around 30k in Georgia and thwy were given to Biden? How does that work? 
What about the fact that some of these elections were legally contested and the courts have so far delayed hearing the cases?  Those elections should not be certified under a legally contested and unresolved condition. They had no right to certify until the cases are heard.
Ashli was gunned down by cops for being in the capitol.  That's all. She nevee threatened anyone and was unarmed. But you think she deserved to be shot because she was in the wrong spot. She was protesting. Granted she was doing it the wrong way. But that was her crime for which she was executed.
What's happened to you?

@merlepatterson,"Paper ballots are used so that they may be publicly audited upon demand in such cases as ""reasonable suspicion"" for a bipartisan and non partisan cadre of witnesses. There was more than enough affidavits, witness testimony for violations of equal protections, documented irregularities and video evidence to justify ""reasonable suspicion"". This has nothing to do with Trump. Nearly 50% of the American people believe there was fraud across the board and cannot determine just how much. Not whether or not there was indeed fraud. A Judge can find a defendant guilty based upon ""preponderance of evidence"", which doesn't necessarily mean there was physical evidence on hand. In this case the evidence does, in fact, exist in the unaudited ballots which the contested states hold.

It looked dirty but I figured Trump could prove the cheating he alleged. He failed completely to do so. The ""Kraken"" was never unleashed because I guess it was never there. All the court challenges failed to provide evidence. When the Supreme court rejected the case it was over. It should have ended then and there. It should never have gone this far. As it turns out encouraging people to only vote in person cost us big time. We had a big early lead in votes because they count the in person votes first THEN they count the mail in ballots. That explains the spike for Biden in the middle of the night, the vast majority of mail in votes were for Biden. It sucks but we lost. If we were cheated we can't prove it.

We’re told to sit back and basically wait for the next election. I understand that we’re the party of law and peace and order, but when the government chooses to fight unfairly and, as l said, turn against the people, what else is there for us to do? What other options exist? The government has proven over and over again that they don’t give a damn about us, and are not gonna listen to us, and it’s time we fix that. We are a country made for the people by the people. And we, as the people, are the government. And what we consider our government has always been the scale that balances the people’s voices. Not a weight that fights against us by playing the favorite minority game, or richest person game. When you become a politician in the US, you go up there and speak for every single person in your party, whichever one you choose to side with. Not a certain group inside that party, not a certain class, every. Single. Person. And you come to the conclusion of what’s best based on what every man and woman in your party have said they like, dislike, love, hate, etc. but the government hasn’t been listening to us.

@nikwick4692,"I respect that you look at politics through a legal view, yet I recall several instances where you were condemning the corruption of state governors and media for turning a blind eye to the issues raised by mail in voting, and for not following their own rules and regulations during the casting and counting of ballots. 
Why, because it created high possiblity of fraud, and cast reasonable doubt on validity of ballots cast.
Even dailywire brought up the suspicious turn around during the dead of night more than once. And covered the number of cases coming to light post election. Yes, there were many that had little merit, but there were several that had solid evidence, video and audio footage, witnesses willing to lose jobs to report on fraud. Yet historically corrupt courts ruled against it. 
So yes, on technicality, the courts found against claims of election fraud. But that doesn't mean there wasn't evidence that substantial national ballot tampering occurred. Big difference, and to dismiss that completely from your overview is just as one sided as a CNN offering. 
Yes, Trump invited the rally. But 41% of the population were already incited by the complete dismissal of ""rigged"" Democratic voter policies in the first place. Seeing the Republican party roll over was equally disheartening.
Only Ted Cruz was cognizant enough to acknowledge that 41% needed to be heard, and needed to know that yes, their concerns are valid, and need to be addressed, hopefully corrected by next election. But to give McConnell props for saying the word unity? He is the type of old swamp politician that has contributed to the broken system by looking out for his own career over his oath of office. His wife is in bed with China, so not exactly an America first Republican.
And no, I do not condone the violence, the vandalism, the injuries. The loss of life is devastating. Yet, people have the right to peacefully assemble. To have their voices heard by the increasingly arrogant and out of touch government. To let their ""leaders"" know that there are people at the other end of every bad decision they have passed. Which was the intent. That some members at the rally participated in unlawful conduct is awful.  And undermined the point of the rally.",0,2021-01-08T00:46:57Z,2021-01-08T00:46:57Z

Regular people and regular business do not deserve to be put in harms way in the name of social justice. I'm not saying that gives people license to attack a govenrment building. But I am saying that yesterday was not as bad as people make it out to be. A security guard opened barriers. Security used force against protesters. Videos show protestors helping to their feet a fallen protestor and pulling down people who were banging windows.

@gwynthegnome2050,"Ben, I’ve been watching your show for years now, and this is the first time I had to give the broadcast a THUMBS DOWN. You are exaggerating in a terrible way. I watched several live stream broadcasts of the protest for hours yesterday, and what I saw with my own eyes was a peaceful protest. Right Side Broadcasting guesstimated that there were over a million people at the rally & protest at the capitol afterward.

Of those *million* people, a handful of people in black hoodies tried breaking out the windows of the capitol building. But as soon as they started, other protesters stopped them, saying, “Hey, that’s not us. That’s not what we’re here for.” Everyone else was holding signs, marching peacefully, and singing songs.

Around 5:00-5:30, the capitol police came outside & started shooting rubber bullets & pepper spray at the crowd to make them move back, away from the building. The one person who was shot & killed was shot by a police officer.

I knew as soon as it started that the mainstream media was going to spin it & try to equate this peaceful protest with the rioting, looting, and building burning that went on in places like Minnesota & Oregon last year. This protest at the capitol yesterday was nothing like that. Not even close. So please don’t say this was the worst thing ever. This doesn’t even compare to the rioting that went on last year. For anyone who wants to see for themselves, Right Side Broadcasting, Global News, and Breitbart were all doing live stream broadcasts that can be found right here on YouTube.",8,2021-01-08T00:42:31Z,2021-01-08T00:42:31Z

I expected graffiti, banners, or some kind of statement after they breached the chamber. Besides shuffling about and spilling some papers, they did nothing but take selfies.

Am I in the wrong here? I just don't see how these actions can be condemned as acts of terrorism. Certainly not from the media and political party who inflamed and cheered on nationwide riots just months ago, riots which led to dozens of people killed.

The judges, seemed to favour the professional class, the swamp, the establishment, out of a orange man bad attitude .... which I realize is inferring motive and intention which I wish to avoid.",0,2021-01-08T00:35:03Z,2021-01-08T00:35:03Z

@phillip557,I completely disagree with the statement that the evidence is unverified. You have to at least look at the evidence before you can rebuke it. Trump's court cases were dismissed without looking at evidence on something called latches. When he first tried to sue it was when democrats were in the process of changing the election rules. The courts said there's no damages. Nothing has happened. He tried filing during the election. They also said nothing happened. Then he tried sueing after the election and they said it was too late. At no point was evidence examined.,0,2021-01-08T00:33:29Z,2021-01-08T00:33:29Z

@steelheron1309,"Ben, your entire stance on this whole thing is absolutely laughable. When states changed their election laws illegally, then ran their elections illegally resulting in huge numbers of inconsistencies, anomalies, and irregularities. And they refused to investigate these oddities. So the answer was to challenge it in court. But when these illegal actions were challenged, their courts refused to abide by the rule of law and used bogus procedural and nonsensical reasoning to deny those challenges. Then the states rushed to ""certify"" their results while legal challenges were still being argued and filed. When the legal avenues were used and the courts and state legislators refused to hold up the rule of law; only one result can occur. And we saw that outcome yesterday. Yes, Trump's rhetoric mixed with Q Anon conspiracy theory nonsense doesn't help, but it's the actions of states and their refusal to ensure legitimate and fair elections explained above that caused all of it.",13,2021-01-08T00:31:53Z,2021-01-08T00:31:53Z

There were attackers, but not traitors in 9/11 - their intent was just fear. They were not ambitious enough to attempt a coup d'état. That is feasible for domestic enemies - not foreign ones.

I've heard to many people today say that it was cool what the mob did. yes I'm a democrat myself but i am intelligent enough to understand that we are never going to agree on everything but we have to be willing to discuss it with facts and truth and meet in the middle. i don't think all Republicans are bad but i do believe trump and his enablers are are evil and i don't consider them Republicans i consider them selfish.,0,2021-01-08T00:21:51Z,2021-01-08T00:21:51Z

Some of you want the same corrupt ""STATUS QUO"", you have deluded yourselves into believing this can be fixed via political ways, you fail to grasp reality of our Government system being corrupted from top to bottom. You refuse to accept it, even when evidence is shown, you still ignore it.

You then become part of the problem, you then become part of the traitors in ways. I guess you will sit even agreeing when they add D.C and P.R as new states making excuses for it, while they attack the 2nd Amendment saying how ""CERTAIN WEAPONS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED"" as you turn and show yourselves the traitors you really are!

So i say this to you.... The amount of people willing to fight, to stand, farrr outweighs and outnumbers your side and ways of thinking. (WE) the ""PEOPLE"" are fed up. ""WE"" the people (OWN) the capitol, (WE) have the ""RIGHT"" to institute ""NEW GOVERNMENT"" especially when we feel our rights have been taken and stripped!

You think this was bad? Just wait until the demon left and Biden tries their ""GUN LAWS/GRAB""... HA! Will make this look like a child's ""BIRTHDAY PARTY"" i am sure.

A sacramental  Catholic marriage is all but unconstitutional. The  pathologies afflicting our tribal peoples alone cries out for justice. It won't happen. It will never happen. We have witnessed year after year, month after month, day after day of lies and slanders. And if you think blacklisting isn't common, think again. The 40s and 50s barely approximate what has been going on for years.  And given the continuing roll out of prominent Republicans criticizing the violence and the Donald Trump in the Capitol, people who were silent  during the summer,  there is no reason to vote Republican again.

Is no one worried that the supreme court can't tell states how to run their elections. So who can hold states accountable? Whats the point of states even caring anymore if no one except the judges in texas can decide that. Why should the judges even care if no other state cares?

Government can only function at the consent of the governed. At what point is your breaking point that you will finally say it's time to take that consent away?

@GunnarFreyr71909,"Golden ooportunity to unify US arround a common goal Shapiro amd Pakman you are authorities, left and right and very respected with massive following of adversary opponents. Set a site politics and see how much you talk in sync right now. Go hand in hand.

 Time for a talk soon. You are good, analytic and empathetic (never hate soeech) and could form as a part of teams of mediators who reach the hand over to the other ca 70 million split from you on approaches after this and healing US.. 

This polarization and tyranny of 51% vs 49% in majority is morevthe tyranny of of the majority every 4 year in America. It means you can push somwthing through pariament with 51% najority. It is what is splitting you up. A lot of people whant a 3rd ir 4th pilitical options but you are stucknwith a system whete tge majority always pysges an agenda through, no matter how tight the maegins are. 

And you reverse it every 4 year and opress 49% with an tyrannical tyoe of democracy. You need more options and a lot of voices in the US don't want to vote for either party but are a afraid that the worse of two will get their vote; so it is always Dem or Rep. A compromise, even very reluctantly.

I wish you had more choices in politics and that your congressmen sre closer to their grassroot voters. It has been pointed out to me and I have made an ninfornal check that a big part of your congressmen leave office as billionaires and only handful refuse big corporate lobby money. Your congress and decision making are made by routined, billionaire politicians who haven't lifted a shovel or a hammer for decades.

But it always leaves about half the nation dissatisfied every election. In Europe we call this the tyranny of the majority. I din't care what they think, we are in majority  Think about a comoany where 49% of the employees akways came unhappy to work. We have to change this somehow and you had to convince at least 25% of your advetsaries to vote yeas; compromises yes but cloer to the majorities wish.

To reastablish your idemocratic institutions and respect just processes and how to move on I see a golden opportunity for adversaries to restore and stable the just democratic processes if they come out of their yes people bubble and work to a common goal; restoring faith in democratic procesesses and the law and order protect everyone equally. 99% want that I assume but don't know to try to find a common ground.

There doesn't seem much dispute about the vioalation of the mob across politcal lines. So now is prime time to time up against this mob behaviour with adversaries that actually agree with you that everything that happened was wrong. And take right, honourable steps together.

Pakman and Shapiro take an initiative and make common statements that are healing and don't come from your poitical heart but humility that it is is your both interests and health, perzonally but  also for your polarized nation to listen to each other and show peace and understanding.

Pakman and Shapiro meet, do unified statements, adressed the whole nation. You 2 are just as good mediators and better than then most oliticians. You will find common ground. Keep it simple. 

Denounce violence and inform people about truth as both of you do. Look forward to implement your co-op. You are in a good sync in opinions on these matters right now.

Peace and love from the oldest democracy in the world, Iceland. Enstablished 930 and still going strong. Fail in America History. So sorry.

@marieamartin4943,"I think this was a terrible thing that happened yesterday. I’m very concerned for the backlash it may have for and on the ordinary law bidding conservatives after Biden takes office. The liberal left have been wanting to punish us for the past 4 years for simply exercising our constitutional right and voting for Trump. There is no telling what they have planned for us now.
What I don’t understand is that all the rioting and burning of cities for the past 9 months was considered mostly peaceful.  Now the same people are calling what happen yesterday an act of insurrection. I do think yesterday’s events were unpardonable. But I also understand that the people were very frustrated and angry that their voices have been ignored by the government for way too long . 
Has anyone considered the possibility of agitators, paid by certain interested parties, to bring about these events for the very effect they have created. Because what I saw yesterday were mirror images of the chaos and invasion of buildings during the riots of in certain cities earlier this past year. 
I am old enough to remember the protest of the 1960s and 1970s. For almost the same reasons of this decade. Some of the protesters followed MLK’s example and were peaceful. But others followed a more radical path and were very violent. It took over a decade for this country to heal. Apparently it was not completely healed. It makes me unimaginable sad to see it all playing out again.
We need a leader and a governing body that are truly concerned for every U. S. Citizen’s needs and rights. If that is even possible. Most of my adult life quite a few of our leaders and governing bodies have been more concerned in their own political and financial desires, goals and gains to concern themselves with the needs of the people they represent.",0,2021-01-07T23:53:19Z,2021-01-07T23:53:19Z

@g.r.senterprisevenatorclas7314,"""Naked force has resolved more issues throughout History than any other factor.""  Jean Rasczack (Michael Ironside), Starship Troopers.

Dumb way to start it with a quote from a Sci-Fi film I know, but let me just get to the point on this before I probably get flooded with people demanding my head on a pike or call be crazy but I do think it needs some saying here and especially now.

  The Right and especially Republicans are going to need to learn that lesson (quote) really quick, Ben and other big Conservatives go around talking about how violence never solves anything, or they won't win through violence. 

 If violence didn't work, then right now, Democrats would not be in control of all three houses of Congress and are about to let their Mob do their dirty work for them against any form of protest from the right. The peaceful option really is off the table here unless you want just to roll over and die because that's honestly the only other option you have. The Left hates you, they don't care about you; they want to force their way of seeing the world on you, and if you don't see it, you get attacked in multiple different ways and sometimes though relatively few thus far but growing they will even kill you.

  So quit talking about peace. If they go low, you go just as low; if not lower, they pull a bat, you pull a gun, they cheat, you cheat, use the same logic against them. Why play fair or play by the rules if the rules themselves were never on the table in the first place?

 There is no Moral Highroad here.

 There never was one to be had and attempts to take it have more or less lead to cowardice and even submission. If things get worse, then things get worse, if you really want to stay free, you have to have the will to fight for it, especially today and in the coming months and or years. This isn't going to just go away now that Trump is gone and Biden is in it is only going to get worse and worse, especially when now they feel emboldened by their ""victories"" and with our own Government officials choosing to enforce the Law selectively and in some cases, not even the law just their own edict.

The Worse thing you can do right now is to just roll over or turn the other cheek like so many Politicians on the Right like to say.

You either win and control the terms and your own fate, or you lose and you forfeit any right to your own self determination. You cannot look at the Constitution or any other legal documents to protect you. Paper and text does not stop Bullets and Bayonets and I feel by the time most people realize this it will already be faaaaar too late.

So wake up to this fact, the America most of the people here likely knew when they were younger is a distant memory, dead, long gone and buried. This is the new reality and its a messed up one but one I once again must say that the people on the Right or anyone that supports even the hint of freedom of speech, thought, or to property or to control your own destiny in any meaningful way need to wake up to and do it fast. 

Thank you, thats all I really had to say. Stay safe and please for the love of God just wash your hands.",0,2021-01-07T23:42:57Z,2021-01-07T23:42:57Z
@tshepomasiea3985,"Ben Shapiro is one of a few  Republicans  that are publicly condemning the events of January 6th with a tone that's more unequivocal than that of many Democrats. Taking a break from bashing a lesbian romantic comedy film and transgender people, to make the clearest assessment of the attempted coup and insurrection by Trump supporters. Is he rat leaving a sinking ship? Considering his complicit cheer leading of Trump's lesser brazen attempts to subvert American democracy, he always qualified Trump's overt proton-fascist statements and actions with statements such as “Trump just says outlandish stuff”, before going on to defend the outlandishness of Trump. This sudden about turn and epiphany might just be a case a of Ben and others on Fox News seeing the writing on the wall, that DJ Trump will leave office on January 20th.

If the insurrectionist had succeeded in coercing Mike Pence to subvert the certification of the electoral votes, Ben might be singing a different tone. He might be telling his viewer how THERE IS a constitutional basis for Mike Pence not certifying electoral votes in states that did not vote for his  preferred candidate and that the whole process is now a matter that only the SCOTUS has the jurisdiction to decide, in hopes for  a third try lucky.
Ben Shapiro and others in the GOP know, and have  known that it is over for Trump, but for their own ratings, youtube views and future re-election prospects, they have encouraged Trump and his supporters to pursue a useless and damaging political errand.  
If after January 6th coup, there was yet another opportunity to subvert the process of Joe Biden being formally recognized as the next US president,  he would still be call January 6th the ""worst day since 9/11"" but for different reasons, reasons where THE DEMOCRATS WERE THE INSURRECTIONIST on January 6th. But now that Trump no longer has any cards left – they are abandoning him like fleas abandoning on a decomposing corpse.",1,2021-01-07T23:42:42Z,2021-01-07T23:42:42Z

The following is an excerpt from John Winthrops 1630 sermon concerning the Massachusetts Bay colony""

""For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God, and all professors for God’s sake. We shall shame the faces of many of God’s worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us till we be consumed out of the good land whither we are going.""


The following is an excerpt from George Washington's inaugural address:

""The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.""


I think both of these excerpts speak plainly to where we find ourselves today.  We as Americans have gone astray and have ignored truth, and I firmly believe that we shall reap the fruits of that folly.  People should read their Bibles and history books instead of listening to the swill that comes out of the news!

We the people, Democrat and Republican, need to raise the bar of unity and honesty, search for truth and honor. Do not rest that responsibility on one or two men or women at the top.  It’s on all of us, and our individual characters and contributions, to make this worldly Republic move forward in righteousness.    IN RIGHTEOUSNESS.  That swamp still remains to be drained.  The last four years of behavior and activity on both sides perhaps indicates that as long as these parties cleave to the world, they will not be able to reap the blessings of true repentance and a turning away from wickedness.  

Our collective nation, INDIVIDUALLY, need to repent and stop the fake, woke, deceptive and destructive and grossly hypocritical judgments of the past, present and future.  

But, alas, these years of contention have all been designed to draw hearts further and further away from religion and from Jesus Christ and His demanding but perfect gospel.",0,2021-01-07T23:37:15Z,2021-01-07T23:38:47Z

Without full access and investigative authority - the whole point in opening an investigation - the only evidence someone can have is that which is retrievable openly *without* access and authority, so of course you can't expect to have ALL of the evidence that would be enough to overturn the election.  That's practically expecting the whole crime to be solved before you investigate the crime.  

That seems so elementary to me.  That's like saying you have to have all the evidence someone is the killer before you can open an investigation to find out if they're the killer.  No, you should have *some* evidence that a murder happened, some reason to look to someone, not have the whole crime solved before investigators come in.

@issadad,"Commendably balanced perspective, Ben at his best. Only one exaggeration stands out, the third and grandest of the narratives that Ben predicts as the fallout from yesterday's assault on the Capitol. Going forward, Ben warns, every conservative will be branded with the same broad brush -- ""insurrectionist rioter"" -- as if the entire conservative movement can now be criminalized in one breath. In some quarters that will happen, no doubt, but it won't be new or unusual. This kind of catastrophic conclusion-jumping, taking sides in a discourse seen less as conversation than as mortal combat, has become the norm in America, strictly self-serving and helpful to nobody. Ben blames the Left (the usual suspects: mainstream media etc) for crafting such narratives, almost as if deliberately distorted storytelling were a distinctly leftist manipulation. What I see and hear is plenty of broad-brush blame to go round on all sides. Sean Hannity? Laura Ingraham? Tucker Carlson? Pirro? Levin? Not one of these influencers, to use Ben's expression, has ever sipped a cup of coffee with an opposing point of view. For years, with exhaustive regularity, about all I've heard from this cohort is all bold black & white headlines: every Democrat is a member of Antifa, all liberals are socialists, ""The Left"" is coming for your guns, the Demonrats (every one of them) want to torch your neighborhood. It's the flip side of the same unilateral gushing narrative that Ben fears, not without justification, will falsely sum up conservatives. As if no liberal could conceivably support the military and oppose abortion, as if no Republican ever could protest a war or advocate a woman's right to choose. Nowadays, the die is always cast. Group loyalty is what defines us, to our detriment, and this is fervently true Left and  Right, where individuality is preached but questionably practiced. Ben does it too sometimes, cherry-picking news stories that play up stereotypes, but not today in Ep. 1168.",1,2021-01-07T23:28:01Z,2021-01-07T23:35:49Z

@wildcolonialman,"This is the end of my subscription to this man. The fraud was overwhelming, stunning in 4 years of preparation, giving President Trump but a few weeks to substantiate. But multiple Court Cases and Public Hearings, and tying all this together, was a task beyond time and logistics, for the PICTURE to be painted well enough to present the RIGHT picture to highest courts. The entire Congress Session to legitimize the Electorate College Count was nothing but a DEEP STATE bought and paid for public charade. The Compromise to Truth is so deep, so entrenched, with so many with no conscience at all-that the result of the Congress was a forgone conclusion. Congress is the Congress of UNTRUTH legitimizing the next Untruth on the agenda. We have enjoyed relative calm in the last 3 years, across the West and the US, Terrorists have left the US alone, and shocking mass shootings in the US have pretty much stopped in the last 3 years. Although Democrat Cities have continued in there usual manner-like Chicago. So CRIMINAL BIDEN will take the Presidency, and the US Dollar will fall, the country will likely be LOCKED DOWN for the Virus, but really for CONTROL of the NEW NARRATIVE by this new REGIME of MURDEROUS thugs intent on SUBVERTING ONCE AND FOR  ALL THE SANCITY OF LIFE DAY-likely to be canceled as DC will be in LOCK DOWN. Trump was a threat to ABORTION LAW, and ABORTION LAW IS BEDROCK to this CONGRESS. ABORTION LAW is the BOSS OF BOSSES. ABORTION LAW IS THE KING MAKER for this CONGRESS.  Its all about DEATH and FREEDOM to kill the CHILDREN. Oh well, like in my country New Zealand, with brand new revamped extrajudicial Abortion Laws, off course the Celebration will begin immediately in the US, and ABORTION SERVICES will get an IMMEDIATE injection of FUNDS and PARTIES will PARTY on for CRIMINAL JOE and the Children can be slaughtered. My country is EXACTLY THE SAME PICTURE now run by a Socialist Communist Party intent on nothing but Social Engineering Laws and DEATH to Children.",0,2021-01-07T23:27:15Z,2021-01-07T23:27:15Z

@lawsontroya,"Mr. Shapiro, I like the fact that you go into detail outlining the reasons the election won't be overturned. I am a conservative Democrat. I voted for Trump. I understand that Donald Trump is no politician. I also get the fact that my fellow Democrats hated President Trump so much so that not only did they attempt an impeachment not once not twice but a third time yesterday. The Speaker of the House is not supposed to ""like"" the president. She is merely there to do her job. Yet she has had it out for the president since he took office. We have laws. We have elections every four years. If your guy doesn't get in, there is always the election four years from now. We may not particularly care for the man or woman in the White House, but they were elected and we move on. I did not want Joe Biden for president. But guess what? In four years' time we get to vote for the president again. This is what makes our democracy the greatest in the world.

Look at discussions on the lawsuits filed. For example, they sued Pennsylvania over unconstitutional voting. Pennsylvania did a “decree” that changed their voting laws, and did not go through the legislature to change the voting laws. And there is cited evidence as to why Texas refused to use dominion voting systems, they did not find them reliable. Texas made this decision early last year I believe before the pandemic. And there were drop boxes set up where they should not have been set up.  Then the odd happenings of them boarding up windows so people could not observe the vote counting and verification. The problem also is they did find instances of dead voters and votes that flipped from Trump to Biden. Why people are angry is because courts refused to listen or even look at the evidence people wanted to present. We wanted a fair audit of the votes, and they refused to do the fair audit. That is where the anger comes from. Not necessarily that we think voter fraud, but that the courts would not even look at the evidence and do a fair audit to make certain that there were no irregularities.",36,2021-01-07T23:23:31Z,2021-01-07T23:23:31Z

@odusjohnson6577,"Sounds to me like you have sold out. You said that what happened at the capital was un-american, what happened with our election was un-american. We are just supposed to sit back and except the results. You say there is no evidence of fraud there was a ton of evidence of fraud. I don't have to prove fraud anyway these states violated the constitution and broke state laws not to mention they violated their on state constitution. By doing so they dis-infranchised millions of votes from states who followed the constitution and state laws. You had a senator on who said he was scared of being hurt during the visit to the capital well good glad he was scared. Think about all the american people hurting right now because of their lock down policies. Not to mention the millions that will be hurt with a biden harris adminstration. You want us and by you I mean Ben Shapiro to just roll over and except this. Like in two years will be able to trust the very people in power who I know rigged this election with the help of the  virus. What a convenient time for the virus also but to put things right so maybe next time we may win ( get the fuck out of here ) I don't need evidence.It was obvious to anybody with any common sense. Thank God the founding fathers didn't listen to people like you or we would have never freed ourselves from the British. I would be willing to bet they also we're refered to as an angry mob when the had the boston tea party and the boston massacre.

So basically the normal hard working american we are just screwed so shut up and let us do it through the courts and at the polls well we tried it and got fucked around on every corner. So fuck you and fuck all of congress.Take the money they used from the stimulus that was to help americans but used instead to double cover their health insurance and given to illegals and fix our building that's right that is our capital and I hope your listeners wake up to who you are and turn you off",1,2021-01-07T23:16:56Z,2021-01-07T23:31:29Z

This was 2016. And you dare to say that 2021 was the worst since 9/11? How is shouting in the capitol and an innocent veteran dying, worse than burning the American flag and destroying the beautiful historic legacy by erasing history in schools and destroying statues? Latest to be removed is that of Abraham Lincoln a few weeks ago. The guy who ended slavery! The guy who made America what it is today, his face is being removed from school campuses and nobody blinks and you fucking dare to come on your show and say this is the worst day since 9/11? Because a bunch of people walked in the capitol? What about when angry cunts suffering from PMS and TDS blocked senators in elevators in the Capitol, when hundreds of them screamed against Kavannaugh? It was so bad, that even Kamala Harris had to make a statement against them! What about in May, when after George Floyd, thousands surrounded the White House, throwing bottles at it, rocks, lighting fireworks, burning a car in front of the White House? The president and his family had to be evacuated to the bunker. Was that not bad? What about during BLM when I constantly heard ""death to white people"" chanted on the streets? When they took control over part of a major city and declared it their own zone? How is that any better?! A young mother in her 20s was shot and killed for saying ""all lives matter"" and you know what people were saying on social media? ""That bitch got what she deserved"" How the fuck is that not worse than a bunch of idiots storming the capitol?? They didnt hurt anyone, except your pussy's feelings. I watched so many times, in so many cities, people moking the flag, spitting on it, gesturing to whipe their asses with it and burning it in the middle of the streets. Yet, you, most Americans, forget. How come some of us in the rest of the world didn't? No, Ben, people who support storming the capitol did not believe they can overturn the election. They are just sick and tired of watching all the things I mentioned going on for years, while liberals and democrats applaude it, encourage it, support it, fund it and Republicans looking the other way, being afraid to even say something bad about Antifa, God forbid they lose their Twitter accounts for such violations. They are sick of it and see that acting peacefully gets you nowhere. But if you act like BLM, if you burn and kill enough, eventually you get your way: cops killed, defunded, made a mockery of and discredited. So hey, you know what?

Edit: to be more specific. The 100+  days of protests outside the court house in Portland which had firebombing  and destruction of surrounding property. The CHAZ where a police station in Seattle was protested then occupied for a month which had its own internal shootings. This happened after about 2-3 days of riot and looting in downtown Seattle after George Floyd. I’m talking about police stations being burned in Minneapolis.  My point is that Ben has seen government buildings destroyed or taken over. You could play semantics and say “well I’ve never seen the capital taken over” which would be correct but seems dishonest  as there has been  protests at the White House after George Floyd’s death which cause Similar disruption and destruction but not the actual takeover of federal buildings.",79,2021-01-07T23:12:37Z,2021-01-08T00:08:16Z

Every one they possibly could in order to be advantageous for themselves &  against Trump. You have Republicans & Trump supporters held to double standard being treated like less then second rate citizens. Being canceled & bullied. Called bigots and racist for anything they did or said.  Encouraged & enabled were Antifa's nightly & country wide 
  violent & destructive atrocities by the democrat leaders. Yet
they looked past and minimized and  straight up even denied they existed all. Every single leader of the democrat party refused to denounce the crimes of   Antifa. Plus went as far as to use funds to continually bail them out of jail & or keep them from being prosecuted. All the while glorifying the Marxist BlM movement as and their looting & rioting.   These ""mostly peaceful"" riot-testors even managed to stalk & murder some people. Dont even get me started on the fake news & censorship by social & MSM's bullshit.  So taking all this along. with the usual disgusting tactics standard practice from the democrats. Which i learned about from you and your show. You sit there say Trump  attributed to what transpired in DC? It had nothing to do with four years of ridicule & threats of violence.

For nearly 70 years those asshats in media, academia, Hollywood, and most importantly, Capitol Hill have being taken everything from the men of these United States. They have made it nearly impossible for a good job without debt. They have devalued and inflated the currency. They have stolen trillions from the American people in taxes. They have sent young American boys to die in never ending wars oversees. They have attacked the Church at every corner. They have destroyed the culture. They are forcing America into becoming a bilingual country. They have walked over the entire constitution, regularly violating the 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendment with impunity. They have emasculated generations of men, getting them addicted to porn and weed to fry there natural dopamine receptors. The have made the women of the nation effeminate, making them believe its more empowering to serve there boss rather than there family. They have been indoctrinating our children with liberal lies, making them hate America. They have made it impossible to achieve liberty; to cultivate virtue. They have stolen over half a trillion from the middle class to give to the wealthy. They have sold American jobs overseas, and what little jobs left are hear we have to compete with millions of cheap immigrant labor, both legal and illegal. They have sold us out to the globalist and foreign interest, time and time again. Every day I see my country begin to fade away, and I'm angry. And I'm gonna do something about it. And what would a group of angry young men with some principles do? Challenege the establishment. So stop parroting exactly what the swamp is saying Ben.

@andrewliang4776,"As a registered democrat I wanted to give my appreciations for this perspective. I do however have a couple of questions/points I'd like to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                            1. You point to how Democrats are framing the Republican party as a whole as radical etc. From what I see the media has highlighted a divide amongst Republicans between those who will follow Trump to the end of the world such as Senator Cruz (to whom I think the descriptions are accurate) and conservatives that follow more traditional values, such as Senators McConnell and Romney. I don't think Democrats portray people such as Senator Romney as responsible for the violence. The characterization of a party by it's fringe is something that happens across both political parties with rhetoric of ""radical liberal _____"" and ""neonazi ____"" I agree with you that it is horrible, but portraying it as a media ploy unique only to the left is also inaccurate. By citing more fringe opinions claiming all Republicans are responsible I believe you are also feeding into this cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2. I don't think it's fair to compare BLM protests and the protests at the US Capital. While similarly egregious, shouldn't the justifications play a role in determining the validity of protests? ie. MLK's protests weren't always peaceful, but we can all agree that they were justifiable. In the same vein, if we assume structural racism in this country is true and that election contestations are over and irrational, BLM protests this summer are at least more justifiable than what happened in the US Capital.",0,2021-01-07T22:48:25Z,2021-01-07T22:48:25Z

@buzzboop,"Why arent you in Polotics Ben?  We need a voice of Reason there.  I liked Mitch's comments and gained respect for him.. but I am struggling with some of the issues that is shared with these Americans at the Capitol and at the same time agree that breaking the law should be condemned.  I would like to hear your thoughts on the following issues:  Isn't signed Affidavits, questionable videos, forensic signs that voter machines can be infiltrated from the outside and statistical anomalies that seem to always sway to one party evidence?  From what I have gathered is that there was no theatre to hear the challenges, thus no reason to investigate the challenges, is that fair or did all three branches turn their backs to the American people?  Also, isnt it our laws that allowed Conservative platforms to be censored to such a degree that Conservative Speak is viewed as much more dangerous than our adversaries outside our border, thus stifiling the 1st Amendment and again turning their backs to the American people?  If we are being cheated of our votes, cheated of our voice and dont have a theatre to challenge this and since mass media decided to side with burning and looting cities as ""peaceful protests"" , Americans probably feel they have to be louder in order to be taken seriously.  What avenue do we have?  How can anyone sit peacefully in their homes now that we dont know what tomorrow will bring with a radical Left Govt.  To me, Ashli Babbit died defending her ONE vote, this new Govt will ensure a Bannanna Republic, there is no stopping them now except with the voice of reason which does not seem possible with the imbalance of our body of representatives.  I see a future of this country with gender/ identity polotics with hatred toward the right, hatred toward white people.  Didnt the Nazi regime blame the Jews for all of their problems, are we going through a historical parrallel?  2021 has me worried that the 2nd amendment was preserved for the days to come.",0,2021-01-07T22:48:13Z,2021-01-07T22:48:13Z
@Axel-zc6xj,"Sorry Ben, I have to disagree. Riots that are going around destroying things and stealing at random are indeed horrible, stupid, and petty nonsense. This includes all the stuff antifa and BLM were doing, burning down cities and occupying a chunk of a city to make their own section. HOWEVER when there is a single target location for the riot and destruction, and nowhere else, then there should be a much different cause for concern. The concern of ""what happened there that was so bad it cause so many people to attack in en masse?"" Well in this case, it was retaliation. People are SO tired of being cheated, belittled, attacked, mocked, and hamstrung by these people that they full-on attacked the capitol. They risked all sorts of types of retaliation, losing their lives, and decided to storm the CAPITOL anyways! Ben, this is only a riot to the democrats' eyes.

The evidence of voter fraud was not present it in any court because the courts would not allow it to be presented. We have seen plenty of it, unfortunately main stream media is the one saying it doesn’t exist. Georgia is where I live, and know our population did not vote Democrat. This is a republican state, and we know that we voted for Trump. The numbers don’t add up when you have millions more votes cast in the national election then we have registered voters. Many states are the same thing. All of the statistical analysis point at Biden’s victory being absolutely unfathomable. The United States of America has just been killed from within. No we can’t vote them out in the next election, because it won’t be any more fair matter fact they will all get worse and worse and worse. Once they learn how to cheat, and they win doing it, there is no gaining back lost ground. We’re done. Welcome to the united Socialist states of America. That’s all that’s left unless we actually go into Civil War 2.0.  Also, President Trump is still president, and you should not disrespectfully call him “Trump”, just like the main stream media does.",0,2021-01-07T22:44:49Z,2021-01-07T22:44:49Z

It looks like there are many people who believe the numerous reporters about voter fraud and an uprising, perhaps beginning of civil war, has followed. That must be why Trump was asking for a delay in the vote, a delay in the certification, and delay in electoral vote counts. That is probably why some congressmen asked for 10 days of voter fraud inspection - a token time in an attempt to transition the people or perhaps to actually review the data abnormalities published. Why would anyone think this would go over smoothly, when there are reports of data issues. If anything was negated - it wasn't publicly provided for the various alleged data findings.

They burned dozens of cities, caused billions in damages, murdered over 40 people, besieged a federal court house for 7 months, captured several cites and created Autonomous Zones where they murdered, threatened, and forced protection money payments.

They told us we were in lockdown as they galavanted around destroying our economy and stripping the wealth of every American and destroying every small business. Then after they destroyed the lives of every conservative who refused to fight back. 

They then won every branch of government after all of that.

Our people broke a window and it's literally 9/11 and Pearl Harbor rolled into one. 

They took power with a year or endless riots and attacks then are able to use a broken window to further their power 10 fold.

In peace they win.
In violence they win.
And in our reaction they win.

We are not heard in courts.
Our votes do not count and now their power will grow a thousand times for 2% of their behavior.

If our elected representatives won't speak for us, the press ignores us, the courts/legal systems are too afraid of backlash to fight for us, and Facebook/Twitter suppress us, then how do we make ourselves heard?

FYI I don't condone violence or rioting, however, as those on the left made abundantly clear many times this last year, *peaceful protests are ok.
*Peaceful protests may have different meaning depending on who you ask.

The founding fathers placed the elections in the hands of the states, so those administrating them would be ""closer to the people"". These governors etc. have to look their constituents in the eye and explain themselves. If they can't the people need to replace them. The press needs to get off the side of the politician and get on the side of the people.

@douglassepic9030,"Calm down, Ben.
Remember the ""protesters"" who occupied ""Chaz"" in Portland this summer or the protesters who burned and looted city after city in the United States in ""memory"" of George Floyd?  The mainstream media legitimized that civil unrest because in the opinion of the mainstream media they had a legitimate cause.
 In the opinion of the MSM, the protesters yesterday didn't have a legitimate cause and never did - simply because the MSM hates Trump.
When people are delegitimized, when they have no place to redress their grievances, when the courts ignore violations of election laws, when judges refuse to hear cases on technicalities, when people feel wronged and cheated and disenfranchised, what did our brilliant ""leaders"" think  would happen? Yesterday, the chickens finally came home to roost. 
Nobody wanted to overturn an election. They wanted a fair election. They wanted their allegations to be heard - not poo pooed and ridiculed as ""wild conspiracies."" But the TV talking heads wouldn't have it. 
Yet, they beat the drum of Russian  election interference for the past 4 fucking years based on allegations that were literally made up, because they - the media - didn't like Trump. For that exact same reason, they wouldn't report on election irregularities, fraud and multiple  violations of state election laws and state constitutions.
Then there are the twits who occupy the seats in the two chambers of Congress. They forget that they derive their power from the people. Those are our seats. Those are our chambers, and those were our forefathers who died to preserve liberty. Yesterday, Senators and Representatives were called on by their bosses (the people) and reminded exactly whose chambers those are. 
Unfortunately - both political parties are more interested in winning a victory for ""the party"" rather than working together in the interest of the perple. Everyone seems to forget that America was brought about by insurrection and revolution when they were no longer represented in government.
The ""institution"" of American government lost its integrity long before Donald Trump took office. Those buildings in Washington D.C. aren't symbols of liberty or freedom or democracy.  They are symbols of corruption, over taxation, person gain and oligarchy.",0,2021-01-07T22:15:11Z,2021-01-07T22:15:11Z
@robertjones5542,"Dune Quote  ""Fear is the Mind Killer..."". 
I believe you can not condone extreme actions but still realize the truth of the cause. 
People have been told to fear for their lives from the deadly virus for months. 
Conservative commentators have been telling listeners to fear for their life and liberty for months. Listeners have been told that with the Democrats taking over we should fear for the existence of our country. 
Now there is shock and outrage that people let fear press them towards mindless actions? 
The smallest mouse  fights like a tiger when it is backed into a corner and is terrified for its life. 
Time for a wake up call for The Government, Ben, Blaze TV hosts and their opposites at the leftist networks. 
People ARE mad but more dangerously they are Scared Out of their Minds! 
Some people will roll over and curl up but some people will bare their fangs and take back what they think is theirs. 
Things have gotten to the point were many people are scared past the point just talking and recent actions on both sides don't do anything to alleviate fears. They just heighten them
It is one thing to talk in the rarified air of talk radio or the capitol, but another to live out in the reality of the average person's life.

@wolfmule9914,"A group of people who where protestors entered a building that is a congressional building , of a democratic country.  The congressional building does have areas where the public is allowed to enter, it happens all time.  They did not storm and threaten until later on.  At that time they actually posed for selfies with the police. The problems all started  when they tried to invade the congressional floor and protestors began smashing their way, labelled by media storming the building.  this is when the police in the building went into riot mode and the officers tried barricading the doors and clearing the congressional floor.  Protestors began storming the offices as well. Some protestors went really to far openly vandalizing the building grabbing things and openly carrying hand guns. This is like demanding a gun control law, and demanding that the business of congress should from now on be conducted locked away in privet not being allowed to be viewed by the public.  Those idiots are as dangerous to democracy these days as and dictator in the past. During this time politicians did not come forward to talk to the crowed, their constituents. Some of the senators and congress people had things thrown at them, I do not know what.  But one congressional police officer put their hand through a broken glass window in a door reportedly and fired their pistol.   As always happen when situations goes bad like this. The person shot was a peaceful protestor. She was unarmed and by the way a mother and air force veteran protesting the way the government is going.  Now I agree with peaceful political protests and if we want to compare history as the congress did yesterday , their are incidents , as they are referred where the peaceful protestors where fired upon , including Kemp State,  the Boston massacre and others.  However we seemed have learned nothing from them.  Prior to the invasion of the floor, by protestors who never really got to the floor before being barricaded out.  Ted Cruz had entered a motion for the audit of all the states, to reassure the public.  After Congress resumed there where a number of congress people calling for audits and states electro votes to be taken out and not counted. However after the resumption of proceedings all the senators who objected just caved in and agreed. The protests and attempt to disrupt proceedings played right into the hands of democrats and gave them the justification of suppression of what is called civil rights today.  Watched it all play out on live stream and really felt sickened by it. I grew up with the civil rights marches of the sixties and desegregation of the seventies. I lived through those riots as a child and it does not seem to matter to anyone that no one learned the lessons of getting things done through politics and courts, now just saying oh lets do this it's easier and get their points and common sense in future condemned and out lawed.

@maahghudah5064,Oath of Enlistment.. we are losing things in our America that people died for. Why does voter irregularities have the same importance as not wearing a seat belt while driving? But if it was treated as a drunk driver maybe something would have been done. It took the loss of our sister to even have them considered it. To be honest they are going to just label us as rioters saying we brought fear to the American people. I only care because I stopped the mob from killing a police but they did not show the same humanity and gunned down one of our sisters. If this was insurrection why were we unarmed? This was about voters and their vote about our constitution. The voter irregularity is not taxation with representation is it? That alone does not constitute a revolutionary war but it does mandate that the politicians know who put them there. Because when you say we will address a voter irregularity issue during the next election will put us in the same situation we just have.

No the supreme court punting on this issue is disgusting. They do not owe an oath of loyalty, but they do owe the country a fair showing and a ruling on the merits.

Further, it is not a state legislative issue, as the legislature did not legislate. Non-legislative groups unilaterally changed election law in the middle of an election with no due process to help their team win.

And I for one wanted them to have to rule the votes invalid, or rule that you can totally kick out poll watchers and count ballots with no oversight. And i further wanted them to rule on whether a single individual from a single political party, can unilaterally and illegally change election law in the middle of the election without any consequence.

That is what is owed. If they are not going to rule on a case like this then what good are they? Especially when combined with the nonsense rulings that routinely come out of that court. Why should i respect them or their rulings at all?",0,2021-01-07T22:05:51Z,2021-01-07T22:05:51Z

I watched a good number of the hearings and looked into the court case decisions the evidence is pretty clear that shady activity as going on election night.  The statistics of the ballot dumps are basically impossible.  The evidence we see with our own eyes.  Can the truth be that different from what we see.  Even Ben says that there is no evidence.  Does he think it is possible that Trump got 13 million more votes at the same time Biden got 81 million votes?  Do we have to accept a scammed election just because we can’t prove it beyond a reasonable doubt?  I don’t get it.  I saw the videos and listened to the stats and the witness testimonies.

And yes, I believe there is fraud in the election. Just like every election in history. But the question is, is there fraud on a massive orchestrated level? That I do not believe.

Why?

Trump's phone call to the Raffensperger made it very clear. There was not specific detailed accusation with specific evidence.

It is all: ""I heard a rumour"".

Second, Trump has this pattern of behavior. This was a common point that was used against him in the 2016 election. It is known that he would claim things are rigged when they don't go his way.

If Trump indeed has irrefutable proof, what is to stop him from releasing it on the internet? Considering his social and political life is over, he doesn't have much to lose.

police let people in, somne others where accessing the building without violence.
the ""rioters"" didnt do really damage at least inside the capitol. at least one women was murdered, shot unamred into the head in the middle of a crowd.
and accodring to a facial reckongnition company not all of the rioters where actually trump supporters but known violent antifa terrorists.
anyhow, this was no insurrection as no violent attempt was made, all people have done is entering a building and screaming a little bit. thats hardly a riot but even if we classify this as that it was defently no insurrection, not even attempted one.

however the left will use it as a claim to shut up the right for good. trump will sitting in prison or flee the country.

When every single media outlet is making you out to seem like you are some terrible person who can’t run the country, the election is stolen. If the media simply presented the pros and cons of both parties it would be a land slide victory for trump. This happened yesterday because people feel so helpless, to know a truth that the media won’t tell is simply disappointing. I have family members who are talking about this, but weren’t talking about the BLM protest because they genuinely thought they were peacful because that’s what the media portrays. This election was clearly scuffed, and to think otherwise is resiculous. Also, a recount of fraudulent votes doesn’t make it less fraudulent.

@Timasion,"I have to disagree. This isn't gross or horrible. It is the chickens coming home to roost. For years, regular people have been told they are sexist, racist, homophobic. et cetera. They're told they need to just shut up and take it. They are promised by representatives that they'll be listened to, then promptly forgotten when those representative no longer need them. If they even dare to raise their hand in disagreement, they are immediately called bad people and disavowed by even those who claim to be their representative. 

Then, these regular people look across the nation and see thugs and rioters do whatever they want and are praised for their actions. These thugs are given what they want. They are allowed to cheat, steal and attack people without consequence. 

How much longer do people have to wait until they can say, enough is enough? When does that occur? From what I'm seeing, many of you think it should never occur.

As a follow on, Ben makes my point. You could condemn these attacks. You could say the electoral challenge was ridiculous. It doesn't matter. They're going to go after you anyway. So why give in. Why even acknowledge their statements? If they try to throw yesterday in your face, throw it back.

They’re hurt from the false science that the state and federal government has pushed upon them. Was yesterday bad? Yes. Yesterday was a tipping point from a cup that was being over filled. 
However, the difference between the left and right riots is the left will go after cities and private businesses. They’ll attack your freedoms and try to silence you. They go after the ones that can’t fight back and can’t help themselves. The ones that had nothing to do with anything. 
The right goes after the government. They fight the swamp. They take on the bigger challenge rather loot and riots stores.

Ben, we all love you but you're wrong. It seems like had someone shot Hitler in 1938, you'd have been right up there going on for an hour condemning the despicable, illegal act.

Are you going to assert that violence is never justified? Do you agree that 2nd Amendment rights were intended to protect against a tyrannical government, and not primarily to protect against burglars etc.? Will you please articulate your standard for when violence is justified? And when the 2nd Amendment kicks in? By definition, it was intended for non-official action, ie. to be used ""illegally"" in the context of a government that has perverted the law and made it protect that which it was intended to defend against.",0,2021-01-07T21:43:58Z,2021-01-07T22:04:13Z

@jblow9394,"Ben, love your stuff but you are saying that courts have rejected the evidence....no they did not.  The abdicated and said they would not even hear evidence with a BS no standing.  What happens when no one has standing?  There is no remedy.

How do you square the Fed or State standing argument?  SCOTUS said Texas had no standing, Wisconsin supreme court says State has no standing with the same argument that Texas was trying to argue.  This is a contradiction and leaves no remedy at all.  Just look at the case filed in both cases...nearly identical arguments.

Now if you say there is no evidence you are going to have to tell me how dead people vote and how no one has done a signature validation at all.  Recounting ballots does nothing unless you do a signature validation.  How there are more votes in states than voters in large quantities.  You know the truth is:  Republican party backed away from Trump..period full stop.

Ted had the right idea...give us 10 days to audit which would have been the perfect out for the Republican party members who did not want to go on record against Trump and still wanted to find out if there were enough illegal votes that threw the election.

But no one wanted to do this cause they saw no one backing Trump and therefor no one will take it up.

As far as the ability of VP to overthrow an electors, it is disputed.  Not fact.

Just look at John Adams and what he did if you want some precedence.  Thomas Jefferson did nearly the same.  Both VPs at the time.  So the originalist point of view is that the VP does have power to reject electors. This was before they had the 3 USC 15.

Now the 3 USC 15 changed a few things.  Due to it not being well written, if disputed and there is one part of the House agreeing and the other does not, it goes to whoever the governor gives the power to.  Problem is there is nothing in the constitution that gave governors this power til now.  It had always been state legislators.  This is why some think 3 USC 15 is in fact unconstitutional, but it has not been challenged.

So again, disputed not fact.  I would love to hear arguments but you cannot state opinion as fact or you are just as bad as the MSM.",1,2021-01-07T21:43:34Z,2021-01-07T21:43:34Z

@randomutubr222,"Man. Look at all those dislikes. The vast amount conservatives who genuinely believe the election was stolen, even when every lawsuit contending it was has been thrown out, even when the ""firehouse"" of evidence we've been hearing about has never come to see the light of day, even when it's patently clear that Trump (regardless of your opinions of him / how unfairly you think he's been treated) is the most disliked president in recent memory.... they still have it in their heads that there is NO WAY Trump could have lost if not but for election fraud.

I'm less than thrilled that the Democrats will be controlling the government for the foreseeable future, to say the least. But the 2016 ""get over it"" crowd really needs to take their own advice. We lost. It's time to learn from our mistakes and rebuild our coalitions. What we saw yesterday was shameful. And all that was gained from it was that the left will now be even more vengeful with their new powers.

I mean seriously people. We just lost control of the entire government. And why? Because you have been so blindly following Trumps lead, and you have so religiously believed that he will still be the one inaugurated (news flash: he won't be) — you bought into his bullshit so deeply, that in Georgia, the main reason why Republicans didn't come out to save the Senate — was because ""the election is rigged anyway, so why vote?""... It is peak level stupidity. Absolutely childish and idiotic thinking. And it cost us the entire government. Every single thing that care so much about; the entire left-wing agenda that you so passionately disavow..... you've just given it to them. You sat there and gave it up. Absolute cowards.

I can't help but hate dumb conservatives more than dumb leftists. Because I at least assume that the left is going to be dumb. But seeing the right be so abjectly stupid right now is extremely disappointing. What a bunch of dolts.

There are people commenting on this video saying ""BEN SOLD OUT!"" ... while completely failing to realize the truth of the matter, is that THEY are the ones that sold out. They sold out to Trump and his myths. They will defend him at all costs, no matter the overwhelming evidence against his statements. That is some real dumb, twisted shit.

Ben is a reasonable man. People love to pin him as this perfect illustration of an evil, party-possessed, bigoted extreme right-wing Republicans. But if you actually listen to him, you learn that he's very reasonable and respects the law and rights of others, even if he has disagreements with the topic on hand.

You better get used to liking your new democrat overlords because that's who is going to be in charge in this country for the rest of your life....

You and the rest of luke warm conservative commentators build your career on constantly harping how the left and liberals are destroying this nation and then clutch your pearls when a group of frustrated patriots start clowing around for a few hours on a governmet building that is full of crooks.

@felicianofernandez8205,"Dear Ben, although I live very far from the USA, I am very concerned about what´s happening there as this will affect the rest of the world for years to come. Therefore, I feel necessary to add some remarks about what you have said in your video:
1.- While I agree, this should have never happened, I am more concerned about riots and systematic cops assessinations that has happened during the last 6 months. In the Manual of the Left there is a basic lesson that violence gradually deployed is always acceptable, especially if the media is in their pocket. If antifa and BLM would have breached the Capitolio, the building would have been burned to the ground. What went really wrong is that one woman was shot to death for which, I think, the Police has great responsibility. The video published shows the woman unarmed, not threating anyone and shot in cold blod like an éxecution. If the Police had managed the Security just a bit better without ´happy fingers´, then this story would have been quite different.
2.-In your analysis, I am afraid you are quite naive in my opinion (like most conservatives around the world). First of all, there is lots of evidence that could not be verified by a proper electoral audit. Yes, we are still waiting for the Kraken on steroids but a simple audit would have ratified all evidence collected e.g. how Pensilvania has +200K votes than voters?. Your electoral system has been compromised as well as a large part of the Republican Party and, even worse, the Supreme Court. Forget about playing with the same rules anymore. If any Court would have heared the allegations and the proofs, I believe you may have had a different opinion. You  do need to change your mindset to fight the left from now on. They do not have moral as you do have and they will use it against you. Unless you (the conservatives) are able to anticipate their movements, you will keep loosing over and over again. And here is where Trump, Pence and their supporters have been mistaken.
3.- Pence could have accepted a debate on the objection, could have pushed back to the legislators their ballots for reconciliation. This would have been a balanced approach within his authoruity and would have added some more days to force some audits for example. This was quite disappointing.
In summary, the USA are (unfortunately) now not different from what has happened to other countries, including mine. Please, wait and see things that you will not believe because the show has just started.",3,2021-01-07T21:37:18Z,2021-01-07T23:01:18Z

@massive595,Ben Shapiro I view you as a rational thoughtful human being look at all the video they didn't storm the capital as you say they let them in when a few people went through the doorways the other people followed and no violence ensued there's a couple incidents of people pushing and shoving but that was it in the videos that started coming out late night prove it DC is in charge of security they had almost a million people there and they knew they were going to March down to the Capitol building and for the very few that went inside the Capitol building I share your issue but is not the most horrible day in modern history what's horrible is having a bunch of people sit inside willfully ignoring a lot of evidence willfully ignoring the fact that they ignored their own state laws and ignored their own constitutions and put forward electors that's what the issue is when they're basically rejecting even looking at the information wholeheartedly going through the election and making sure this doesn't happen again when they're rejecting that premise yeah you're going to have some issues so shut your mouth talking like that go back and watch all the videos and then come back on your f****** show and give us real thoughtful coverage,0,2021-01-07T21:33:19Z,2021-01-07T21:33:19Z

@rickie5150,"Hi Ben, you make some very valid points and use more common sense than most. Do you think that President Trump fabricated all the evidence and sworn testimonies that would warrant a thorough inspection of the Dominion machines that counted votes?? Trump wanted the votes properly inspected, verified, then counted and trusted the courts to do their judiciary duty and enforce that right... but they didn't.  A recount and recertification would have put the God loving Patriots at ease. Nobody needed to die because of the fraud and injustice of this election. The voting machine algorithm shows that there was corruption and that can not be discredited. CAN NOT BE DISCREDITED !  Where do we gain access to the truth ? Who is telling the truth ? Why has the politicians who are ""wicked"", Stonewalled the People from getting a fairly counted election ? This election was stolen... 8,000 dead voters(in Michigan alone) is 8,000 reasons to do a recount and recertification. 8,000 votes won't change the election, but the courts were shown proof of fraud and they should have dug deep to find out how deep the corruption actually is... they did not. The judges looked the other way. President Trump is not a corrupted politician... He definitely ran because of the horse shit job that Obama and Biden did for 8 wasted years. Obamacare... what a DISASTER !!! Obamacare put us on the path to financial default and future implosion. Dimentia Joe (a.k.a. JoeSniff)... who in the right frame of mind would want that for a president. Kamala... she literally had no support( zero%) as a potential presidential candidate and quit. Now there is an unwanted quitter in the VP's seat... You can't make this garbage up. Trump is a God fearing Man and a leader with great moral character. He is God's chosen and I wonder what punishment will be coming for those who have defrauded this great man and the American People. If People aren't running to God, they are running away from God. You won't get an ""Amen and a A-women"" out of me Brother Shapiro. I get a sense that you are trying to calm people down with your words... and that is commendable. However, I'll bet that you silently know in your heart, that one of the greatest president's ever, was cheated out of his rightful place behind the wheel of America.

@8a12a05,"Hey Ben. Shut up. You are a brilliant guy, but I respectfully must say in all honesty, you’re wrong about key things and just plain uninformed in others. 

Rudy Giuliani, through a series of probably thirty podcasts on his website, and hours on his radio show half hour he occasionally had time for, he laid out the facts. The evidence, as must as he felt he was or should be legally disclosable Pre-trial. 

In each of the six battle ground states in contention by Trump’s legal team, there was overwhelming evidence that votes numbering three to four times the number of votes needed to switch outcome were fraudulently made, scanned, mended, scanned multiple times and or contestable on the grounds of each state’s own constitution which was broken in at least two states. 

Secondly, Trumps team filed around 20 suits. One of which was won. The appeals process got three cases to the Supreme Court which were all ignored. Prior to the election, PA Republicans filed suit against Act77, and it was docketed and put on hold by the Supreme Court saying no election had occurred yet, so there was no harm/standing, for the suit. It must wait until after Election Day.

On Election Day, US Supreme Court justice Alito issued a writ of certiorari to the PA Supreme Court, to segregate ballots which were only accepted because Act 77, or fraudulent reasons of other natures. 

PA ignored Justice Alito. 

After election, PA Republicans were told latches. As in, the suit was filed too late. 

First too soon, then too late. Days apart. The case was not heard by the US Supreme Court. 

Texas, along with many others, seeing what was happening, and what did happen, they filed suit against PA. 

Any state on state lawsuit or dispute has automatic elevation to the Supreme Court, as the appropriate setting for the matter. 

Despite PA’s breaking of its own constitution Election process, and breaking Article 2, Section 1, clause 2 of the US constitution, and having automatic standing, the court told Texas they didn’t have standing. The case was dismissed. 

In PA, 800,000 ballots were scanned with no Republicans observing, after they’d been sent home on the pretext of being done for the night, while the Dems stayed and feverishly fed ballots for Biden into the machines. The supposed mail in votes were un-creased, same handwriting, and only had a Biden vote, no down ballot votes. It would’ve been too time consuming. Meanwhile a trucker testified to having driven a couple hundred thousands ballots from another state to PA. These ballots arrived in similar fashion at approximately four AM in all five states, arriving in cardboard boxes, suitcases and trash cans and bags. Legal ballots must be transported in a locked wooden chest. 

In each state, Trump’s sizable win/lead was suddenly reversed come morning. 

Rudy has almost a thousand sworn affidavits from Republicans and Democrats who witnessed fraud in each state. 

No case got to present evidence. No case was heard in which any evidence was even able to be shown. That is not the same as there being no evidence. 

Rudy said even Fox refused to have him on air. 

Meanwhile Sidney Powell is investigating Dominion, Smart-matic, etc, and the machines themselves. Rudy also had forensic audits done on the few machines he was able to secure. 

The evidence was overwhelming. 
The machines were programmed, connected to Internet, and designed to steal elections, first used by Chavez. Operation clipboard and project hammer are two of its greatest original tools. Both remotely or electronically alter tabulations. 

Biden votes were weighted by the machine to be counted as 1.3 votes, which Trump’s were weighted at .7. The algorithm was set to always keep Biden 3-5% in the lead, fraudulently. When the vote differential became too great, the machines shut down, as they did in a Venezuelan election, at which point operators can manually uploaded tens of thousands of votes, which all registered the moment machines are back online. At each state, a spike defying probable statistical possibility occurred, registering hundreds of thousands of votes, almost all for Biden. Only ~2% for Trump, also a statistical impossibly as even in the most blue district of the most blue state, Trump’s numbers were nowhere near that low. 

Thirdly, every bellwether sign and feat, was accomplished by Trump. Not Biden. Never has a president lost who had secured one or two of those. Trump had THEM ALL. 

We are a country now inescapably corrupted by China. From Justice Roberts, to Mitch McConnell, to Joe Biden. They all are.

Can you really blame people for following that lead? A lot of people are convinced that the entire electoral system is fucked beyond repair and they’re sick of the steady stream of bullshit, deception and double standards from the establishment media, the government, social media companies, etc. 

People are sick of this shit. Rioting is unquestionably wrong. But I do understand why these people think it’s the only thing they have left to do. Clearly the corruption runs deep. That much is undeniable. Those of us who were raised right were raised to believe in America; to believe in this system of government.

@Angel_Investor_Music,"I'm by no means trying to justify yesterday's violence, but saying it's worse than what we have seen in the BLM riots is ridiculous. The storming of the capitol was baby stuff compared to the six straight months of rioting in Portland. Seriously, go back and look at all the stuff that's been documented by Elijah Schaffer and Drew Hermandez. It is a hundred times worse. I've seen bricks and molotov cocktails thrown at law enforcement. Hundreds of officers were injured and some were permanently blinded. I've seen Antifa shoot fireworks and throw explosives at a federal courthouse, trying to set it on fire while people were inside. I've seen two cops get shot in the face while a guy laughs on video. A woman was murdered for saying ""all lives matter"". I've seen business owners beaten half to death for protecting their businesses. Multiple conservatives have been stabbed, and one was shot to death. I've seen corrupt district attorneys refuse to prosecute violent rioters while going after good citizens that use their second amendment rights to legally protect themselves and their property. People who have been livestreaming the riots have been harassed, threatened and assaulted. The murder rate skyrocketed in cities were they defunded the police, but they still kept preaching the same destructive message. 
There was nothing about yesterday's mayhem that was in any way worse than what took place for months in Democratic cities. Saying otherwise is implying that a bunch of politicians and a government building are somehow more valuable than the hundreds of innocent people whose livelihoods were ruined by the BLM rioters. In conclusion, fuck anyone who supports violence and vandalism, but it was the mainstream media and corrupt politicians that emboldened radicals on both sides to think that this is a proper way to protest.",0,2021-01-07T21:23:49Z,2021-01-07T21:35:32Z

@sarabuschepflorent1532,"I disagree with you Mr Shapiro--there was no real path to a legal and orderly transition of power----the process is not finished.  You are also too young to remember the prior riots in Washington DC and the takeover of Federal buildings or burning of streets.  The first political act I remember was the assassination of JFK and the rioting was minimal.  I cannot type anymore--I have already lived through blood on streets at UCalif at Berkeley, in Chicago, in Hong Kong and at Tien An Men in Beijing.  China and the Demons have won this round and clearly video cams will show how many BLM and ANTIFA members were at the front of the 'BREAK In"" to the US capital being.  God protect President Trump, Cruz and the others with good conscience and honor.  

Today we finished loading our boat and leaving. thank God we have  back up plan. Grandchildren will go by plane with me.  I can hear you on VPN when they arrest Trump and blame actions of Antifa, BLM, on peaceful Trump supporters. That fly on head of Pence did mean something and it was not good for Trump or conservatives.  Again, mis-handling of personnel in DC because the ""protestors were white"" allowed the Capitol to be over-run.

It is not about white supremacy; it is about lousey voting systems; it is about outraged citizens at mostly peaceful protesting!",0,2021-01-07T21:21:43Z,2021-01-07T21:21:43Z

@howdabowdix,"The evidence the election was stolen is overwhelming and multifaceted. Ben's refusal to look at it and acknowledge it only tells me he's more concerned with keeping his YouTube channel than with election integrity.

Millions of unsolicited, mail-in ballots. Refusal of election officials to enforce laws requiring verification of signatures and valid registrations. Intentional error rate of 68% in voting machines. Proven accessibility to vote-changing capabilities in voting machines from offsite internet access. Removal and destruction of hundreds of thousands of suspect ballots assigned for audit. Poll workers calling Trump votes for Biden during recount. Poll watchers barred from tabulation areas. Mass Trump-to-Biden vote switching observed on live TV. Pro-Trump ballots found in the trash. Late night mass vote dumps nearly 100% for Biden. At least one county where 100% of military ballots went to Biden. Unsupervised poll workers pulling suitcases of ballots out of hiding spots and scanning the ballots multiple times each. And of course there's the data showing thousands of dead people cast ballots in this election -- enough to erase Biden's lead in several places if removed.

All of this is backed by document, statistical, and video evidence, but contrary to your assertions here, courts have refused to hear it. Grow a pair and LOOK INTO IT before insulting our intelligence again, Ben.",9,2021-01-07T21:20:21Z,2021-01-07T21:28:38Z

Yeah no not the same!! The media covered for them and back then not only that the mayors of those cities also said any protesters will not be convicted so where are you been staying in the studio don't take any risks we'll fight for you whether it's with pain or sword and you need to know they're coming to a point or depend just doesn't work sitting in your chair just doesn't work will you pick up your musket no you have one of us do it you'll defend your home for sure and your family like anyone else would but would you go down to the battlegrounds I'll leave that up to you to say,1,2021-01-07T21:14:58Z,2021-01-07T21:14:58Z
@douglasrimer6770,"Your condemnation of the violence is shared by all of us. You ignore the fact that Antifa thugs have already been identified as infiltrators and instigators. Was Trump ill-advised to urge a march on the Capitol? Probably. Your consistent focus on excoriating Trump for his sloppy language is understandable, but maintaining that the election was legitimate and your assertion that there was no credible is academic at best and at worst intellectual dishonesty. The evidence was not examined because it was squelched - the courts refused to examine it. You make lip service to major concerns over irregularities, and then maintain that those irregularities were insignificant in the outcome. I beg to differ. There is proof that the Dominion machines were  connected to the internet, there were missing SD cards, that Trump decrements coinciding exactly and simultaneously to Biden increments occurred, affidavits from 100s of witnesses, ballots appearing during counting shutdowns, etc. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and talks like a duck you maintain it's not a duck unless proven to be a duck by a DNA analysis submitted to the court and the court refuses to get involved. The election WAS stolen, and now we have a unified Democratic government. (Dominion machines were used again in the GA senate runoff if you can believe this). Good thing you have job security commentating on the demise of the American experiment at least until you are censored at the whims of the powers that be.",0,2021-01-07T21:14:55Z,2021-01-07T21:14:55Z

1) There was widespread fraud in the presidential election. 
2) None of the fraud was addressed by the courts, and none of the court cases were thrown out based on the merits. 
3) Many Americans became frustrated by the lack of any investigation into fraud allegations. 
4) Election officials stonewalled any actual attempts to investigate fraud.
5) The frustration of many Americans has caused an erosion of confidence that the system designed to protect them from government overreach will continue to do so in the future, leaving them vulnerable to similar extreme outcomes that have played out in other countries throughout history, causing fear and uncertainty, NOT toward President Trump, but conversely,  toward the corrupted government he devoted his presidency to protecting them from.",1,2021-01-07T21:06:01Z,2021-01-07T21:06:01Z

BUT, most of Trump's lawsuits have been dismissed on procedural grounds. You're too early to make this case. Or you're too late to make this case. 

And you wonder why Trump voters are upset? And in the case of observers seeing votes counted, the Judge didn't care how many feet observers were forced to be away. Just so long as they were in the building. 

And, again,  you wonder why Trump supporters are upset? These things keep compiling over and over. And it's frustrating. And questioning voter fraud is absolutely justified. 

That said, is invading the Capitol justified as a result? Absolutely NOT. I will never agree that conservatives should result to radical left tactics.

Hell I'm not gonna even include natural disasters since 9/11 because I'll be here forever. What happened yesterday was entirely unfortunately and avoidable but Ben Shapiro is being overly Dramatic.",1,2021-01-07T21:00:43Z,2021-01-07T21:00:43Z

@jamesnapoli3353,"I think Trump has lost most of his support and sympathy after this stunt.  His remarks to the crowd were irresponsible and inflammatory, whipping up the people into a frenzy and, hence, the result.  I agree with Shapiro that, as a president, this is unacceptable behavior.  People are tired of the constant chaos and controversy.  I was a luke-warm supporter of the president during his term, but now it's obvious, for the good of the republic, he needs to leave office.  It's a huge disappointment that democrats are essentially now the senate majority (what happened with Georgia?!) so we can only pin our hopes on the mid-terms in '22 and coming up with a solid presidential candidate for '24.  Someone who is, overall, a fairly moderate, unpretentious, down-to-earth candidate who is able to connect and reason with people of different ideological backgrounds.  Crenshaw?

Very respectful.  They walked To the capitol.  The police freely opened the barrier to let them walk through!  Why? that never happens.  Nobody forced the police or scaled over.  Trump supporters literally were on the steps praying and singing.  The lunatic people were dressed as Trump supporters were clearly NOT with them.  Then those very people were not with them did all of that bad stuff!  Who are they is my question??!
The media have been sooo dishonest the people never know the truth.  Why Not a separate committee to investigate so the Americans can see for themselves there was an honest election.   Well paid left media  the coo , lies, slanderous hate with impeachment ..the media NEVER did their job!  Broadcast lies of white supremacisy and impeachment dominated the fake news. People don't want to be controlled but to know and decide for themselves and frustrated (no excuse for the deaths).  This has caused a big problem.  Trump said to stay peaceful and did not promote violence.  There was massive much more carnage at the previous riots, arson, murder and looting.. which was called peaceful in the media while cities burned.  This lack of truth, tons of slanderous comments and no media even reporting possible fraud.  There were truck loads of ballots, and non constitutional elections decisions in PA.  This is not all on Trump.  I'm surprised how severe you are jumping on the Trump slanderous train.  I hope you were out crying more at the very extreme murder, looting at the rioting that again was called peaceful.  http://url6822.wellnesswarrior.club/ls/click?upn=ZXPkkkvHe1lr8bW5dY25-2BmYIXP-2BqE8-2FPU33V-2BnsLy1pq-2BoLMafpSbVylyhKPWcOOrkqQrDmsZFkJCjCBvh1PiWSjLfTCMgPEqamd2aVH-2BB9yLDsRjPHbDIuzxBRoArnV4YEepgK0CkA466cblRXnBJkrFWrpzl3BPYN1tHDd4MGHf8R-2F6vFdDV08kCRFJJ12M51pZZa-2BVEmLU-2FdJxBQyU1oJ2PlVv8-2F2LEZHx7D8Z0H6mDV8axb0m8WO8V0Bu0LkIiya-2FuS2PuFg-2B-2FwxKzjBcNVUHfvoHp4mZDF6RgTqJbZcU4WR6UG70pORzatBlUh-2F5OoKOPYHsEA0uXXYAVhleY4T7l8zuZVFgdC-2BZFH7oqmwxXfOH6BTvkehzGoR6-2FDa8Cwq_dZ5WDwwpW23Ls40NDJ6frgG7MsIcnilrp5uSyyAPqtVahkrdyixC7ktkHfiD0aVCejGo3g90r72pKfjHoep5EU2Ft7TrV6JLKSDgkjiQHCxfhBCm7K-2F0w0m0Z2zpjhc9hQYkjxMau7GIGuchJ6wVtTBdO25qG4g5yhg19WEV6HRYSTX0pSA7PP8rCYs8R8EORZz1-2BDiKXoIu3A2HFhM0icyM0tlhuRVMoT8K91qTJro-3D",0,2021-01-07T20:55:08Z,2021-01-07T21:28:16Z

@emersonharris142,"18:15 Have to disagree with Ben here.  It is not a bad argument because while the evidence of fraud is required to make those claims, it is also true that the perception of fraud can be just as bad as fraud itself.  If the people do not have faith in the system of democracy then you have a more likely hood of people not participating or resorting to disruptive protesting or worse.  This lack of stability can be just as bad.

On that same note, Paul Ryan was also calling for the evidence to be shown to a bipartisan group with 5 dems, 5 republicans, and 5 SC Judges so it can be evaluated, not to just overthrow the election without evidence as you are implying here.  Most of the court cases were all throw out on procedural grounds not on the bases of the presented evidence.

If you are in doubt if a lack of evidence, then you need to watch some of these state senate hearings that went on.  The video of the GA election officials sending people home then running ballots 3 times while no one was looking is rather damning evidence.  And before someone says that was debunked, the ""debunking"" was asking the election officials if this was a problem.  That is like asking the fox if there is a problem in the hen house.  There is video of wrong doing, there needs to be some kind of report saying exactly why they think that was okay to do in full detail.  As a GA resident I'm infuriated at our local officials about this and other evidence that was presented in those state hearings.",0,2021-01-07T20:51:22Z,2021-01-07T21:20:27Z

@MrVpassenheim,"Predictably disappointing in your lack of perspective. The republic is officially dead, thanks to the communist Democrats and Benedict Arnold Republicans who thought it a too great ""inconvenience"" to demand for a forensic audit that would TRULY certify the fairness and trustworthiness of our elections. You were MIA in 2016 and a repeat offender now. Bravo!

***This was NOT an attempted act of insurrection. This was a peaceful protest, SABOTAGED by Antifa insurrectionists, with 4 people (the ones involved in the violence, presumably) not being arrested, but rather being KILLED. Never once did that happen during the ""summer of love"" despite far greater crimes being committed in MANY instances.***

The MONUMENTALLY EVIL action was the STEALING of an election. What happened at the Capitol was an isolated inconvenience. NO INSURRECTION. Insurrection involved FAR more than a small mob of protesters breaking into a building. The violence yesterday is the equivalent of a typical day in Chicago.

@ericbess5917,"One thing does occur to me in the difference between protests.  Cuomo was all about ""tell me where it says protesting is supposed to be peaceful"" and compares the BLM protestors to the founding fathers...but look at who the protestors are targeting.  Now don't get me wrong - I do not condone the violence that happened yesterday.  But it is a bit hard to take Cuomo seriously when ""his"" protestors were primarily attacking citizens.  If they were going after government, it was typically local governments (that in many cases, supported their message).  I think you have to respect the fact that if you are going to protest the government, you should at least protest the government.  The people yesterday were misguided, but to pretend there wasn't evidence that they had been wronged is just stupidity promoted by the media (""no evidence"" is a lie...McConnell tells it right when he says that the evidence doesn't reach the level of proof that would be necessary).  That doesn't make what they did right...everyone needs to take a step back.  We need to get behind the purported results of the election...but we all need to give some hard thought to what happened this election, why so many people feel it was stolen, and what we are going to change in the future to restore the confidence of the people (hint: people who are more worried about ""voter suppression"" than ""voter fraud"" are likely those looking to commit the fraud).",1,2021-01-07T20:43:01Z,2021-01-07T20:43:01Z

It is insanity to just sweep this under the rug and pretend as though nothing happened. Random stopping the counts in the middle of the night, vertical spikes of hundreds of thousands of votes for just 1 candidate etc... this is garbage.

@NDZ-jf8ur,"I love you Ben and I think this is maybe the 2nd time I've ever disagreed with you. I used to listen to you everyday on the radio when I delivered mail for a living. I retired almost 5 years ago and don't listen to the radio so much these days. You're still probably my favorite guy to listen to when I do listen. First of all what happened yesterday is or could be the new normal and these chaotic rules have been established by the Guard Dog Press and the DemocRat party and their Jehovah's Witness like devotees. Are you familiar with their (JWs) nickname ""Armageddon Incorporated""? In 2016 Liberals like Paul Krugman and Nancy Pelosi made some very specific fear mongering predictions that of course we know never happened. Liberals were calling for Trumps head and calling him a scumbag and illegitimate since before day 1. Surely you remember this stuff? ""This President committed nothing short of treason and we all know what the penalty for treason is"". I mean do we just quote the Con Man who previously occupied the WH and say ""We're better than that"" because that was another one of his Big Lies and we all know Dems ain't ""better than that"". It's personally not my style (at my age) and I don't condone or encourage the violence that happened yesterday, but like I said this is the new normal that has been dictating to us by our political opponents. And I'm watching the video as I'm typing this message and you're pointing out what's criminal and what's a crime, but if there were to be a revolution whether left/right then and the rebels would no longer be criminals if they win the revolution right? I mean didn't one of the founders say ""Either we all hang together or we all hang seperately""? Weren't they treasonous treacherous traitors by English law? I'm sorry, you put PedoSniffer Joe up on the video and I had to stop watching. I'll resume in a minute but I will skip through the Banana Rupublic Joe speech. Okay, so have you made a video demonstrating that what happened on 03 NOV 2020 was a fair and honest election and that Dependables wearing Joe won it fair and square? Is the evidence all fabricated and are the witnesses and experts who testified just a bunch of Liars and Whores like liberals say all whistlblowers, victims, accusers are when they don't like what the Liars and Whore's are saying? But of course their witnesses are to be believed based on an accusation alone with the presumption of guilt and the burden of proof for the accused and of course it's okay to destroy someone's life and family for the sake of their ideology.",0,2021-01-07T20:29:30Z,2021-01-07T20:47:48Z

@motosport8851,"Voter and election laws were broken you call yourself a reporter now you are claiming to be a lawyer also. There are some major problems one county in GA had to adjudicate 106k votes out of 113k votes that is not a small thing. the law says you can not open mail in ballots until after the polls close and count them. But they were opened checked and sent back with how to correct them to voters. That is illegal. Not allowing observers to observe the count that is also illegal. No court would look at the election problems. There were many cases filed but if any of them went to court can you name them, and the outcome. Trump did say he would transfer if it was a legal vote. I do not think it was a legal vote. GA we have video evidence they were counting votes without even the state observer being their. That is illegal so it was illegal vote. So if a state breaks there voting laws and the state courts will not take the case, so you move it up then the supreme court. Ben you say that they should not look at it. Then who should look into these illegal voting actions Ben?",0,2021-01-07T20:28:38Z,2021-01-07T20:30:19Z

It's a brilliant strategy for a few agitators to start a riot knowing that the optics would be very bad for the Republicans, causing a potential shift in the party.

They would almost be foolish not to try it considering the media are on their side and the unlikelihood that they'll be caught and exposed.",4,2021-01-07T20:28:30Z,2021-01-07T20:28:30Z

@R3IMU,"Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my brethren: here there are states.

A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for now will I say unto you my word concerning the death of peoples.

A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: ""I, the state, am the people.""

It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life.

Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.

Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.

This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of good and evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language hath it devised for itself in laws and customs.

But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the biting one. False are even its bowels.

Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto you as the sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this sign! Verily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!

Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!

See just how it enticeth them to it, the many-too-many! How it swalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them!

""On earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulating finger of God.""—thus roareth the monster. And not only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees!

Ah! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy lies! Ah! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish themselves!

Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! Weary ye became of the conflict, and now your weariness serveth the new idol!

Heroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it, the new idol! Gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good consciences,- the cold monster!

Everything will it give you, if ye worship it, the new idol: thus it purchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your proud eyes.

It seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many! Yea, a hellish artifice hath here been devised, a death-horse jingling with the trappings of divine honours!

Yea, a dying for many hath here been devised, which glorifieth itself as life: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers of death!

The state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all—is called ""life.""

Just see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the inventors and the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their theft—and everything becometh sickness and trouble unto them!

Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves.

Just see these superfluous ones! Wealth they acquire and become poorer thereby. Power they seek for, and above all, the lever of power, much money—these impotent ones!

See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and thus scuffle into the mud and the abyss.

Towards the throne they all strive: it is their madness—as if happiness sat on the throne! Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.- and ofttimes also the throne on filth.

Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Badly smelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly they all smell to me, these idolaters.

My brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites! Better break the windows and jump into the open air!

Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the idolatry of the superfluous!

Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the steam of these human sacrifices!

Open still remaineth the earth for great souls. Empty are still many sites for lone ones and twain ones, around which floateth the odour of tranquil seas.

Open still remaineth a free life for great souls. Verily, he who possesseth little is so much the less possessed: blessed be moderate poverty!

There, where the state ceaseth—there only commenceth the man who is not superfluous: there commenceth the song of the necessary ones, the single and irreplaceable melody.

There, where the state ceaseth—pray look thither, my brethren! Do ye not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?—

This person stated that Trump seemed to be really delaying his speech, and kind of rambling on and on. Almost to the point that it was obvious he was trying to keep his supporters there. Meanwhile over at the Capitol, the so called ""Trump supporters"" were breaking in. I have a very hard time believing that our security of the Capitol building would be that weak too.

@Buraztebra,"Leftists just want everyone to be treated the same by law enforcement. The way police escalated BLM protests by using force where it wasn’t necessary was absolutely disgusting and uncalled for (I’m talking about the protests not riots). I don’t know if people who watch Ben have seen many of the countless videos of police arresting and often violently harrassing people literally just walking or chanting for the cause they believe in (a cause you have the right to disagree with), since his viewers probably mostly consume more conservative media outlets, but believe me, those videos are out there and I encourage you to search for them. We just don’t think it’s fair that those people had to peacefully protest in fear, while others on the opposite side of the political spectrum had no reason to fear law enforcement while rioting and breaking into the most sacred democratic institution of our country literally attempting to overthrow democracy. The fact is that 84% of police officers voted for Trump in 2016, while only 9% did for Hillary (who I hate) and throughout recent history have consistently overwhelmingly voted republican. I think a crucial part of police reform should be about officers learning to better withhold their biases while on the job.

I also think the left hired those paid protesters we have been seeing during the riots to storm the Capitol. The right don't act like that.

The courts through out the cases without hearing the evidence. Explain the vote flips on live TV. Without all that we have unconstitutional elections.

Because the changes were unconstitutional, the elections were unconstitutional, so any electors resulting are unconstitutional. This gives Congress every right to throw out those electors.

@SupaFlyJedi,"I'm going to disagree with Ben on the voter fraud.  The second half of Cruz' speech was left out where he proposes taking a commission of 5 Senators, 5 Congressman and 5 Judges to form an Electoral Commission to actually investigate the voter fraud claims.  There is a precedent for this, I can't remember the exact years, but late 1800's.  Regardless of the evidence presented, would go a long way towards quelling most of the 39% who don't believe (not in Facebook hashtag fashion, but actually believe in the depths of their soul) Joe Biden is not legitimate.  They will find fraud or they won't.  My personal opinion is that whatever this Commission finds will be accepted by a vast majority and we can go on with our lives.  It's not really about the Commission, it's about the fact that nobody is listening and we were told to kick rocks by virtually everyone without the due process.  If Joe Biden is shown to be President, then so be it, but address our grievances first.",1,2021-01-07T20:15:37Z,2021-01-07T20:53:40Z

At that time, the most powerful military in the entire world. Outnumbered, undertrained and ill equipped. Those men, women, boys and girls held the line until France and Spain sent ships and troops to support them in their struggle for Freedom and Independence. 

And if angry American citizens storming the Capital building still bothers you, where would you have stood during The Civil War? Blue, Grey, Northern or Southern?

@thomydavid,"Ben, I have been watching you religiously for years. I always found you to be a rational voice of reason and fact-based arguments. I have sent so many people to your podcast because of the respect I have for you. But I’m going to be honest, I’ve been getting frustrated with your recent glossing over the impact the courts have had on this election and the evidence. The main thing I think you’re overlooking is how the courts refused to hear the evidence. They claimed they had no standing before the election b/c they haven’t been impacted by anything yet, then claimed they had no standing b/c they brought their evidence after the election. They never looked at the evidence with the exception of one judge. You’re also lumping lawsuits filed by others in with lawsuits filed by Trump. Please stop saying that you believe in presenting the evidence in court and then claiming the courts didn’t see any evidence of voter fraud therefore there is none! Trump had his day in court and he lost. But he never had his day in court. You’re not giving any weight to Stacy Abrams’ sister(?) who is a judge, making a ruling on this case, the Secretary of States (especially in Georgia) publicly saying they would match signatures, and then refused after making a back room deal with Stacy Abrams, the ridiculously low rejection rates, the list goes on and on and on. 
It’s important to note, I condemn all violence and condemn storming the Capital. I don’t really believe those were Trump supporters, but even if they were, they need to be prosecuted and locked up if found guilty. 
Their actions set us back so far and they did exactly what the demoncrats and media wanted them to do. A woman/veteran lost her life for god’s sake! And it now sounds like three others lost their lives, not to mention the people of the Capital Police getting hurt, some of whom are my dear friends.

With that being said, people are sick and tired of our government and their overreach. People are tired of being called a racist, having their hats ripped of their heads and beaten in the streets for having a different opinion while the police (who we support, defend and respect) stand by and watch. Tired of our kids getting sent home from school because they wrote the word Trump on a piece of paper, tired of getting fired from our jobs because of cancel culture. Tired of being called dumb rednecks and deplorable, tired of being censored by the twit from Twitter and the morons at Facebook, tired of “fact checkers” refusing to check facts. But worst of all, people are tired of not being heard, tired of the perpetual slaps in the face, tired of wasteful spending so politicians can enrich themselves while once successful hardworking citizens lose everything they have and struggle to feed their families, tired of the corruption, tired of the self aggrandizing nonsense from political hacks, tired of having their rights and freedom taken away by the very people who were entrusted to protect and defend those rights and freedom, tired of the hypocrisy, tired of Republicans constantly giving in to Democrats’ demands regardless of how destructive those policies are, tired of the GOP getting absolutely nothing done when they had the chance, tired of Republicans ignoring the will of their constituents and ignoring the promises they made to voters during their campaign. Tired of lectures on morality from the most immoral people in the country, tired of politicians breaking the law and getting away with it while average citizens are held to a different standard, tired of them telling us that what we see with our own eyes isn’t real. Tired of people like these Secretary States (especially “Rat”ensburger in Georgia) violating the law and their oath of office because of childish personal vendettas and back room deals made with morons like Stacy Abrams. Tired of corrupt judges and Supreme Court Justices who ignore their responsibilities and the constitution because they have to pay back their debt to Mitch McConnell and the Federalist Society who got them nominated. Tired of politicians screwing over the American people by ensuring their back room deals with lobbyists and foreign countries like China continue to line their own pockets and their children’s pockets. And then for these “Republicans” to stand up and say there wasn’t a problem with this election...?! To claim they are the victims?!  

I watched you destroy Pierce Morgan on the 2nd Amendment episode in which you handed him a copy of the Constitution and reminded him that the 2nd Amendment existed so the people had the means to defend themselves against a tyrannical government. He tried mocking you by asking if you really believed that would ever be the case, to which you responded: “absolutely!”  
If this government hasn’t yet demonstrated how tyrannical they have become with these lockdowns, gun control, immunity for themselves and so on, then what does it take? I guess everyone has to wait until Ben Shapiro declares that, in his opinion, now the government has gone too far and is officially “tyrannical” Is that what we should all be waiting for? Your approval?

No one was asking Pence to overturn the election. He was asked to send the electors back to the states which had obviously broken the law by allowing people outside the legislatures to pass unconstitutional changes to those states’ voting laws. A lot of these legislatures are/were not in session (which begs the obvious question...) 

Once again, I condemn violence from yesterday with 100% conviction. But there’s a line in the sand, an in the minds of many, the government crossed it a long long time ago.",50,2021-01-07T20:05:52Z,2021-01-07T20:05:52Z

@ericbess5917,"I agree with Ben about the overthrowing of the election.  However...I absolutely feel that Ted Cruz's point is not a ""bad argument"".  It is a bad argument if the goal is to overturn the election.  But my understanding is that Cruz wasn't trying to overturn the election and Ben even acknowledged that Cruz knew this earlier in the video.

The point is - if that many people feel that the election was stolen...then there is a problem with the process that needs to be addressed.  Perhaps this isn't the venue to bring that up and if that is Ben's point, then I'm on board.  But if Cruz's intent is to draw attention to the facts, then I don't personally really care where he does it...but it needs to be made good and clear that something needs to change so that in the future, people DO feel like their election process has worked in a legitimate fashion.

Unfortunately, the problems we have in this country are more systemic and they stem from the media.  I appreciate that Daily Wire is trying to make a difference, but when you see how Fox News has been consistently attacked over the years...and the fact is, many Americans already take it as a given that Daily Wire is an evil organization...then simply having alternative media isn't enough.  People need to wake up to where they are getting their information and start questioning whether they have been brainwashed.  I am a conservative, but I don't see liberals as the enemy.  I DO see news sources that intentionally twist the truth to fit a narrative as being an enemy and I've seen that on both sides of the aisle, but predominantly on the left.  In terms of established sources, it is almost entirely on the left.  I'm not talking about allowing bias into their reporting - that is understandable.  I'm talking about intentional misrepresentation of facts...like claiming a guy with a gun at an Obama rally is doing so due to racism...while selectively editing the photo to avoid showing that the guy holding the gun is himself black.  I'm talking about saying ""no evidence"" of voter fraud over and over again when anyone can see with their own eyes that there is plenty of evidence...If they were to say, ""the burden to overturn an election demands much more than just evidence and such a burden has not been met"", then I wouldn't have a problem with their reporting, but ""no evidence"" is a flat out lie designed to sent a narrative.

There is no question that the election was stolen this year...I have no idea whether there was sufficient voter fraud to overturn the results...perhaps not.  But the fact that the vast majority of voters weren't allowed to know about the Hunter Biden emails...and the way the impeachment hearings were covered.  I don't recall a single time the allegations against Biden were mentioned without the inclusion of ""unsubstantiated""...as if not investigating something because it hasn't been investigated before makes any sense at all...The fact is that there are very important questions that should have been answered, but the media was only interested in covering for the democrat while attacking the republican.  Like how many people feel Trump did such a bad job on Covid when 95% of what Biden has said he would have done is exactly what was done...and the media attacking Trump on ""not acting soon enough"" without mentioning how badly he was criticized for his Chinese travel ban.  If we had even a remotely honest media, Trump would have won re-election in a landslide.  So yeah, whether or not there was voter fraud is irrelevant - the election was stolen through propaganda on a people that doesn't bother to keep itself informed.  And ""universal mail-in voting"" was for one purpose only - to make it so easy to vote that the people who normally wouldn't bother would have no excuse not to...you know - the uninformed voters who normally realize how uninformed they are, so they don't bother taking their time to show up to the polls...if there is no effort involved, then why not?  After all, they know for a fact that Trump is the most dangerous president we've ever had...because that's what the media is telling them.",0,2021-01-07T20:05:38Z,2021-01-07T20:05:38Z

Saying that he believes that these elections were stolen, wasn't anything new. He's been saying that for quite some time, so why would it suddenly have raised temperatures yesterday?

As for his recommendation to the protestors that they go and cheer on certain senators and others not so much, surely that can hardly be qualified as incitement towards violence?

That's not to say that he didn't cross some very  serious lines yesterday. His suggestion that judges that he supported owed him some sort of loyalty can't be reconciled with the separation between the different branches of the government. And him refusing to call in the National Guard when some protestors turned into rioters who invaded the Capitol building was nothing less than shocking.

It's okay for swamp creatures, to crack citizens over the head and let them bleed out with their policies and law making. But if a citizen cracks them over the head, because they're being suppressed in every way and have no access to any justice or freedom of speech, what are they suppose to do Ben? And a few of the trouble makers were the shipped in Antifa. Why are you condemning Americans for having their liberties taken away for them? What are they suppose to do Ben? You Present evidence, that I Ben Shapiro am  jew, and the Judge rules, no son, you're Jamaican? Whats the next step Ben? Do you keep appealing until they come to consensus that you're latino? The courts don't care about the truth. Most of What Trumps said is accurate. 
Are the Dems playing by the rules? So tell us Ben what do you do when theirs no justice & no freedom of speech. Everybody including yourself were very suspicious of voter fraud, prior to all the evidence, of which was never seriously looked at, because that would contradict whats being pushed in the media.  But because there's no justice & no freedom of speech, what do we do Ben? A jew who is now officially recognized as Jamaican.

@PaintTheMap009,"Ben. I know your heart is in the right place,  But how many of these so called conspiracy theories have we watched proven right before our eyes over the last few years..  How many secrets exposed by brave men and women who were willing to risk their life from Julian Assange to the man at the computer repair store who had the Hunter Biden hard drive.

 How long have we seen how crooked, dirty, lying, manipulative and hypocritical the left is.  How many times have we seen them throw both the law and law enforcement agencies under the bus every chance they get unless they could use them to serve their own purposes... Complete disregard for the law.

  You are being a fool to cast so much judgement on conservatives who have been backed into a corner farther and farther for years.  The reason Trump speaks so freely about things so many in the media are quick to call unjustifiable and irrational conspiracy theories, Is because he has seen just as much proof with his own eyes as we have, that same proof that the courts refused to see.... Everyone on the right is so afraid of conflict by the time we do get a judge in the right position, they don't have the ball's or the spine to purge this evil from our country.  The left has not been held accountable for their actions. The left has not been held accountable for their actions! 

If the courts are not holding citizens of this country accountable to save the face of their own narrative, then all the podcasting Republicans I've been watching need to outright defend their own worth the same energy. We can play fair again when the sane regain control. 

No, not a dictatorship. Just more of encouraging bright minds like Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard. And removal of filth like Biden, Pelosi, McConnell, Watters, and Romney..",0,2021-01-07T19:52:09Z,2021-01-07T19:52:09Z

@wileytheacmesalesman7760,"Ben, the fact that you still can’t see that this country is lost is why it was lost in the first place. These people want conservatives gone either way. They don’t need an excuse, our existence is their excuse. When you wait til they are loading you onto the trains to resist, it’s too late. All these “sacred” buildings and promises made by liars mean nothing. Our founders would be ashamed of us that we let it get this far. I’m ashamed. Trump isn’t the issue. People saying conservatives need to be rounded up and put into re-education camps is the issue. Trump was simply a symbol of a last ditch effort to regain something that was lost. When you steal someone’s last hope and tell them the future is bleak, this is what happens. Your useless yammering hasn’t helped for years so I don’t see why it would help now.

Never in our history has a presidential candidate lost his second term vote when they received millions of more votes than their first term.

The election was stolen - the entire world can see this! There's no doubt about the fraud that went on.

Biden got in because of the incredible dishonesty, lies, deceit, and manipulation by the globalists.

@BloodLegaZ,"If Trump is responsible for stoking the flame for one day to these people's rage, then the media is responsible for stoking it for years. Our county came very close to civil war. So very, very close.

If those rioters had the resolve to go and kill off those senators in a belief that Trump would be able to take office afterwards, we would be in chaos right now.

The democrats had their hand in this from the beginning, and they came incredibly close to bringing out beloved country to an end. Don't let them win, don't do their work for them. 

Every Republican needs to put for better voting measures to ensure Biden or Kamalah doesn't see a second term. Every media member and employee needs to examine themselves and ask some hard questions about what they truly believe in and if they should leave. And every American needs to respect that Trump is not our leader anymore, nor is Joe Biden.

Our government no longer represents 74,000,000 people. If the Democrats do what they have threatened, which I believe they will, it will change our lives until the people stand up to them. And  socialism will not surrender like our republic did. We believe in the rule of law and the constitution, Democrats do not and have used this against us. In fact they control our rule of law and our constitution ""Supreme Court"". I don't know how far down the rabbit whole we will go, but within the next 8 to 10 years we will no longer be a world power.

@guptaji812,"My views on Yesterday's capitol incident:

What I think that Trump's own people backstabbed him.
Trump was too naive too have this huge rally on such an important day. His advisors played him.

The Deep State/Democrats/Left saw a very big chance to dent Trump's image throughout America and World. I'm damn sure these rioters are Antifa people disguised as Trump supporters.
Just see the orchestrated Reporting by Media throughout world bashing Trump now. All American Media and Celebrities condemning it. Social Media strategically targetting Trump when he even haven't written anything provocative.
All these are the very same tactics of the left.

The Democrats knew that the Tump had the majority. They know that people don't trust them  for they have rigged the election and Biden has no credibility on global level. He is more often seen as a Chinese stooge. So why not dent Trump popularity to gain sympathy. And this has worked very well. The amount of power Trump would have hold if would have walked out silently would have been very dangerous for the left/democrats. By this incident, they have made a dent on Trump popularity among a portion of his supporters and throughout world.",0,2021-01-07T19:40:44Z,2021-01-07T19:40:44Z

Was it legal for the Obama administration to reup FISA warrants despite clear exculpatory evidence?  Nope. Doesn’t matter. 

Moreover, the entire mainstream media and social media has focused the entirety of their energy to purge Trump. Complete censorship of any criticism of Joe Biden.

@AziaXtremeNFinity,"In my own personal opinion I REALLY DON'T CARE WHO WON ELECTION 
because we don't have presidents anymore all we get now are GANGLORDS and CULT LEADERS  
It's been like that for almost 13 years now it with Obama who thought he was the Messiah of America but he only divided our country by pandering to the leftwing racists and Trump doesn't help the situation either abd he's somewhat encouraging the same thing like the LEFT had done back in 2016 
HE BETTER NOT ENCOURAGE HIS POLITICAL BASE TO ANOTHER LEVEL like the Democrats with Antifa and BLM 
and if he does he just proves my point: he, Obama, and Biden are nothing more than GANGLORDS, MOB BOSSES, a CULT LEADERS who WANT to divide our country 
Because what do ganglords do? they fight with other gangs and divide people 
Because that's what the Democrats and Republicans have become: bloodthirsty gangs and religious zealots who deify their respective gods; Trump and Obama (vicariously through Biden) 
and know what else gangs and cults do? They want to control, manipulate and enslave the normies 
who are the normies? the moderates, both liberals and conservatives 
WE'RE THE ONES WHO WANNA KEEP THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER 
WE WANT PEACE AND UNITY 
I can't say that for the Republicans and Democrats aka the Holy Church of Trump and the Almighty Tabernacle of Obama 
ALL THOSE ASSHOLES EVER DO IS FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER, JUST LIKE GANGS!!!! 
they hate us because us moderates, WE REFUSE TO GIVE BOTH OF THEM POWER 
For 13 years the Repulican and Democrat gangs and cults have hijacked our country and are holding it hostage FROM US 
Obama kidnapped the USA from us first and Trump is only holding it purgatory 
Because the Democrats wanna turn America into the USSSA (the United Soviet Socialist States of America) and Trump wants to turn it into the USDT (the United States of Donald Trump) 
Because what else do gangs do? They divide land into gang territory! 
while us moderates, the REAL AMERICANS and PATRIOTS we wanna keep THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
The America of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, JFK, FDR, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Pastor Billy Graham, Walt Disney, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman and so on 
The Republican party died with Reagan and the reformed Democrat party died with JFK 
After Reagan it was the Era of the Puppets, Bush 41 and 43 and Bill Clinton 
But lemme say this much: even though those 3 guys were not good presidents I will give them credit for this much: NONE OF THEM HAD EVER ENCOURAGED DISSENTION AND DIVISION AMONG OUR PEOPLE unlike Obama/Biden and Trump 
So us moderates we need to stop supporting the Republican and Democrat gangs who rule our country with an iron fist 
We need to support more Independent and Third Party nominees and politicians who are hopefully moderate like us 
WE NEED TO TAKE POWER AWAY FROM THE LEFTIST AND RIGHTWING GANGS AND CULTS WHO WANNA CONTROL US 
The Leftists and the Rightwingers will try to virtue-signal, manipulate, gaslight, intimidate and bully us into submission 
*  Leftists will call us racists, sexists, bigots, homophobes, and all the names they usually use 
*  Rightwingers will call us SJWs, woke, Never-Trumpers, NPCs, we have Trump Derangement Syndrome and ""Orange Man Bad"" psychos 
*  us moderates we call them FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE: sleazy, slimy cowards, hypocrites, scumbags, liars, deceivers, charlatans, conmen, bullies, and thugs BOTH OF THEM! 
both of them will intimidate us through social media, entertainment, news outlets, education WHICH IS GOOD because it shows their cowardice and hypocrisy 
It's gonna long fight for the soul of America 
FIGHT THE LEFTISTS AND THE RIGHTWINGERS but do not strike a physical blow 
TAKE THE PAIN as both them will double team us as it should it be because all fighting hurts 
show them they are bullies and thugs and we're not gonna take it from them anymore

They simply won't - all this means to them now is that you, finally see what is so bad about the group of people you associate with, Trumps tyranny has come to pass just as they predicted it would. They will feel vindicated and justified in all of the appalling acts they carried out this past year, they will be motivated to continue on as they are.

@Benny_101,"It was not a good move for Trump supporters to storm the Capitol Building. One, because it'll not help Trump in any way (the other way around, actually), and second, because they know the media and elected officials will not run cover for them like they do for BLM. It's honestly baffling to see these people saying Trump is enabled by the media, when over 90% of his coverage is negative. People have to go digging in the internet to find the truth, and honestly, something positive written about Trump. Honestly, is partially why Conservatives are probably going to lose. Don't get me wrong, it was the right move to condemn what happened yesterday... But that's not what the Left would have done. The Left would have sinked their heels in and defended the protesters, even if they spent a whole month inside the Capitol, even if they had torned it, and burned it down. The Left is not really afraid of sinking down to any level really, if they think it's coming from ""their team"", or if it'll help their cause. Also, because they do believe in revolution should normal course of action fails. So they are willing to go somewhere... Not even just conservatives, but classical liberals or libertarians, wouldn't.

But what happened only hurt Trump. But I tell you Ben, it hurt Republicans more. And not with independents Ben, but with conservatives most of all. I told you, Trump supporters are NOT Republicans. They don't like the stablishment, and they just view Republicans as part of it, if not spineless weaklings who are too afraid to stand up for their values, because their opponents might use the media to paint them as racists or homophobes. If you think Republicans are in any shape to take back the House in 2022 Ben, think again, because the people who sided with Trump WILL NOT show up to vote for people who, in their view, abandoned them when they felt wronged by the system (regardless if you think they actually were or weren't)",0,2021-01-07T19:25:00Z,2021-01-07T19:26:37Z

@BaioWithMayo,"Ill start this by saying there is no justification for the events taking place, I just want to shed some light on the perspective and why some of these people did what they did: When more than half the country doesn't believe their vote counted (rationally or not), when the news says BLM and ATIFA protests all summer were peaceful protests yet a 2A Virginia rally was violent and nazi ridden, when you lose the Senate in what felt just as fraudulent as the General Election (again, rationally or not, without proof it doesn't matter), when you are locked down for nearly a year and 60% of businesses aren't coming back, people are backed into a corner and lash out. When the media says BLM are peaceful with over 30 deaths and billions in damage and our protests are violent with next to no damage or deaths (prior to yesterday, which also only had 1 death by police) people just say ""fuck it"" and show the media what they claim we are the whole time, and act out violently.

This is all inexcusable, but that's just my opinion on what people are feeling and why this outburst occurred. Let's not have this shit happen again with these rioters or BLM riots, move the fuck on, and win legally until they commit illegal actions upon us. Not saying to fight with a hand tied behind our back, but until they start committing their crimes, we shouldn't lash out either",3,2021-01-07T19:21:54Z,2021-01-07T19:21:54Z

@virtualee2000,"Ben, evidently Congress has dodged investigating election irregularities, despite calls to do so, despite it being within their power to do so, and frankly, despite it being their obligation to do so in the face of insurmountable evidence. It has become clear in the last few weeks that top Republicans like McConnell just want Trump out at all costs, and have acted along with the Supreme Court to blatantly  frustrate the carriage of justice. If it is true that Trump actually won with a landslide, then up to 80 million voters have very clearly been disenfranchised in the most horrific manner. To sit there and pretend Congress played no part in provoking this chaos is deeply hypocritical, and I assume you are pandering to Youtube's threat to strike any channel that breaks the fake media narrative that there is nothing to see here folks.....just move along. Yesterday was a bad day for democracy, and is the death knell for the Republican Party who are too short sighted to realise that they needed Trump to survive.",0,2021-01-07T19:17:31Z,2021-01-07T19:17:31Z

@TheGrizNation,"I don't understand why something like yesterday is the worst thing ever but the entire summer of 2020 with riots and burning of cities across America and citizens killing one another was not that? How is storming and occupying a building meant for the people anywhere close to being as bad as the riots that took place over the summer? This is just more gaslighting and dishonesty from the media. And it's not going to help. If we had more people explaining why yesterday happened more than we have of people immediately saying how awful it was, then we can move on but just calling people who are fed up with all this bullshit terrorists and yesterday being the worst day since 9/11 is false and going to get us even more angry.

And people like Ben and Mitch just rolling over and saying we should take a look at certain areas of the election and fix them.. WHO THE FUCK IS GOING TO DO THAT NOW? The next 2 years at least are lost. The big picture of this is horrendous because we played by the rules at every turn and were roasted for doing so. In a fair election and society, playing by the rules and working hard wins out. But we no longer live within those parameters Ben. So you're going to sit and squabble on the daily about how bad everything is and watch it not get better due to your own inaction and then get mad at fed up conservatives for storming buildings that were made for and by them, the people. There is no good end to whatever scenario you think losing constantly, over and over to the left is. The country and it's systems are not fair and true anymore. The sooner you understand that, the sooner we can push back and hopefully get them back to where they once were.",0,2021-01-07T19:16:49Z,2021-01-07T20:16:05Z

Just saying that this kind of violence is much more in Antifa’s wheelhouse and I am hesitant to assign blame until we actually know who started the breach...who left the pipe bombs at the RNC and DNC? Who vandalized both Pelosi and McConnells houses in the past week? I think it is much more likely to be Antifa, who is trained in how to incite violence and chaos and then get out quickly and leave the original protesters to deal with the consequences. They’ve done the same thing with BLM protests all year.",0,2021-01-07T19:11:30Z,2021-01-07T19:11:30Z

@GerbilOfMight,"Sorry but Ben is partially wrong on this one. First I agree both this and the riots are bad, and criminal, but I don't see how he can call this the WORSE day in American Political History when we had months of exactly this with BLM and Antifa. The billions wasted, dozens dead, and federal buildings vandalized without any condemnation from the left, with the left actively BLOCKING law enforcement, THAT, is far, far, worse. There is nothing sacred about the capital building. The DEAD people from the riots are far more sacred, and the scope of the riots said to everyone we can do whatever we want, the riots more than Trump told people that they could do this. This is what you get when only one side is punished under law. Either everyone is under the law or no one is, America will not work, CANNOT work, as long as one side plays by the rules and the other does not. Shock? It's not shocking at all that after decades of abuse, of Democrats ignoring the law, Republicans do something wrong. You cannot expect it not to happen Ben that is an impossible standard, it will happen, and it will happen again, that doesn't make it right, but it is a standard of insipid ""niceness"" that lead us here. Trump didn't help by being inaccurate but people have decades of hate for Democrats for being slapped for existing. He was just the match if it wasn't him it would have been someone else.

And Trump is not suggesting, HE BELIEVES, the election was stolen are you telling him to lie? That doesn't mean I am convinced, I'm am not, I'm with you I want to see the evidence, but inferring that he should lie or hide what he believes IS MORALLY WRONG. That is what the bad politicians do. He said what he believes and just like the loons on the left he should be able to do so and if other loons act on it it's on them.

I'm also wondering why Ben doesn't mention that the law is failing in the court cases that keep getting thrown out on procedural loopholes before evidence is even presented. Hard to use evidence under the law when it's not even allowed to get that far.",0,2021-01-07T19:06:20Z,2021-01-07T19:20:44Z

@zdlinden,"Ben,
You don't fully understand whats happening here. You will in 2 years.
Worst Day since 9/11???
Not even close
When a crime organization steals an election by fraud and takes over the leadership of the country by illegal means.......well that's much worse
When things like that happen a certain portion of the population is going to react immediately against these criminals. Because they recognize wide spread deliberate fraud and manipulation.
Longer term, the people who realize their country is being seized by racketeering criminals  and well funded billionaire Social Media CEOs and execs, the result will be a revolution at some level against the criminal organization that buys its political and governing power.  A revolution is brewing against these criminals and their censorship and manipulation tactics designed to control the weak minded. 
The one thing that is most important here is election integrity....That is now gone forever. The criminals have seized control of our government now by fraud and political and social influencing. 
The most hilarious part of this is that the system has put the onus on the wronged to prove that the criminals have committed these crimes. They knew going in they could get caught and there would be no chance that they would be stopped because of time constraints and the fact that the fraud was destroyed upon the acceptance of the illegal ballots. They knew they would get away with this going in.
The democrats will now pass legislation to ensure they can cheat in every election from now on so they can never lose again. Welcome to the Socialist states of America.............
Soon to be the communist states. Here comes new states of Puerto Rico and DC plus 17 new Supreme Court Justices....all democrats

@Faladaena,"Xcuse me Ben, personally I think the burning, looting, murdering and assaulting of innocent people/bystanders and not even exempting the elderly is *far worse* than to enter & occupy a building that strictly speaking isn't just the government's (but ""a monument to the *American people* and their government""), and I believe governmental buildings have been places of protest before too.

And btw, there are numerous signals (and footage) that Antifucks infiltrated the protest too, maybe instigated some of the violence, but even if that's not the case, how much can people take, *knowing* and having *witnessed* the fraudulent actions and courts too coward to examine the sh!tload of collected proof, making it easy for more lies and scheming??

I'm not saying it was right, but come the F on, it's the same government that's been pissing all over its people in the worst ways possible, imposing rules that cost livelihoods and homes, whilst they themselves don't bother living by! Don't forget, not everyone is as financially sustainable or comfortable as yourself! A little more empathy for 'Joe and Jane Blow' and a little less lawyer spirit wouldn't go amiss...

@el9107,"Ben you’ve totally missed the mark on this situation. All summer we watch BLM riots and DEMS covered for them. They are not playing by the rules they expect conservatives to play by.

You keep trying to hold both sides accountable but that only works if both sides hold the same ideals and values, which they don’t. DEMS are disgusted by Conservatives and have been for 40 years. They generally hold high disdain for conservative values, morales and how children are raised. 1 and 10 teachers is conservative and the large indoctrination in our schools by the left has breed 3 generations of intolerance towards conservatism. 

What we witnessed yesterday was terrible but no DEMS would denounce BLM riots yet conservatives are supposed to hold our side accountable? Spare us, we are fighting this with one hand behind our backs and expect DEMS to do the same.

The Democrats have learned that talking can be subverted by just going ahead with their agenda. So don't sit there in your chair and criticize the people who got up and did something about it. There is no other avenue to pursue change unless you think that sitting in your chair and talking has really affected what the Democrats are doing to the country.

@The333,"Ben, I like your Podcast (and I have not listened past the first couple of minutes to be fair), but I am sorry, I just do not agree with you on this.   

In the 1700's, the Colonists were labeled as ""terrorists"" by the British monarchy and by proxy, all of the Colonial, boot licking loyalists (who would be the leftwing narrative followers of today).    People should not fear their governments.   Governments however SHOULD fear their people.   The Capital Building - 100% - is the RIGHT place for protests to occur.  It is the seat of power and people like Chuck Shumer and Nancy Pelosi need  to see, hear and if necessary FEEL the anger of 51% of the people in this country.  They are out of touch and tone deaf and they SHOULD be afraid - very afraid.  This country is FOR the people and BY the people.

First off, the reports are that the actual individuals who stormed the doors and broke in were not even Trump supporters - they were ANTIFA agitators trying to provoke violence and mayhem.   Despite this,  the protests still remained AT THE CAPITAL.  No businesses were burned, not statues were torn down, nothing was vandalized or graffitied.   A window and a couple of doors got broken - so be it -  (and a woman was shot, not ignoring that) - Point is, this was NOT thuggery.   This was  a large group of voters who were angry and have felt betrayed and swindled by the likes of Mitch McConnell, Mike Pence and now sadly...  you.

""The tree of liberty periodically must be fed by the blood of patriots and tyrants"" - you need to read this quote more, Ben.   Freedom and change does not happen through talking and texting.   It looks exactly like yesterday.",0,2021-01-07T18:43:58Z,2021-01-07T18:43:58Z

Yes he told the rioters to go home, but he also told them he loved them and he egged them on the whole time. 60 failed lawsuits lost due to lack of evidence of voter fraud yet he still plants that idea that the election was stolen. He is liable for what happened. Period. The buck stops with Trump. That's who's name is on those flags. HE is the only evidence of fraud when he called Georgia and asked them to commit fraud for him!

I also take issue with your claim that there is no substantial evidence of fraud that could change the result of the elections.  If you listen to the Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin legislative hearings there is copious evidence of fraud.

@mrBaronvongunn,"There is no democracy.....Ben Shapiro shows what he always was, a defender of the status quo. Our government no longer serves us, they serve themselves. We are slaves to a corrupt political class of elites who have overtaxed us, ruined our lives, robbed us of our livelihoods, our savings our , our jobs , our futures. All the while turning their own families into dynasties, enriching themselves from the money that we earned through our own sweat and tears for ourselves and our families and loved ones. Now our government , our country has become a an appendage of China, a province of communists ideals and marxist socialist ideologies. The only thing that will stop any of this, will be civil war. They sold us out and treat us as property. Ben probably doesn't have any problem with that part since he and his family are well provided for. Its easy to sit in a gilded cage and tell everyone else they have no right to fury or rage or restitution. Ben proclaims there was no justification for the citizens of this country to claim back the capitol that belongs to them. Ben acts as if the constitution is being followed by the very communists who seek to destroy it. Who exactly does Ben align with? Seems Ben is more comfortable with empty vessels like Mitt Romney and his ilk. How many times are we going to listen to empty republican appeasers lecture us and tell us , ""THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE....WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS""..... there is only one law and it is for the Elites, only one law that serves the rich and powerful, one law allowed all of these corrupt politicians  and so called public servants to build institutions that would enshrine their own pursuits, their own wealth , their own power. THEY DONT KNOW WHO WE ARE...THEY DONT CARE WHO WE ARE.....WE ARE SUBJECTS TO THEIR NATION, TO THEIR ONE LAW THAT SERVES AND PERPETUATES THEMSELVES! Patriots are what is going to be needed. And violence will be all that we have left as any kind of shield and tool. NONE OF THESE PEOPLE IN POWER CARE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. It will be Patriots who stand any chance of saving it, but it will also require the blood of tyrants.",1,2021-01-07T18:37:06Z,2021-01-07T18:37:06Z

@Alan_Edwards,"While I do believe there was some level of fraud associated with this election and possibly some tampering with the voting machines which needs further investigation, it was not proven so what Ben is saying is just the facts and we need to move on. That said, IMO the biggest thing that impacted Trump’s re-election bid was how it was handled by the media and big tech who pretty
much blackballed Trump. And while that might be unethical and distasteful, it is not illegal. They have a right to support the candidates they chose to support and can use misinformation if they chose too. I think it will come back to bite them in the ass and hope it does. In the end the Dems played a better game and the Reps are pissed. I get it and hopefully we will learn by this mistake and be ready in 2024.",0,2021-01-07T18:36:58Z,2021-01-07T18:36:58Z

@Elcrisso1,"What the domestic terrorists fail to understand is that whether you support your government or not, you have it good living in America. The wealthiest country in the world. This is what happens when people spend too much time obsessing over conspiracy theories and when society puts so much emphasis on scaring the people with social media fear-mongering and hatred that it mistakes trivial annoyances for the need for social revolution. Idiots at Trump rallies who feel like they want to make their mark on history as “the freedom fighters who fought the government in the 21st century”, without opening their eyes to the fact that they’re assaulting the same institution that they’re leader is apart of, as the President of the United States instructs them to enact violence like a cowardly child who is upset that play time is over.

The day that the government is so intimidated that it caves and bows down to the whims of an angry mob outside their doors is the day democracy fails, and the day civilisation crumbles.

@dansuh01,"Ben can’t leave his audience hanging like this. Where is the in-depth analysis of the evidence of election fraud? 
Ben said the “Trump team didn’t argue election fraud” and evidence of fraud has not been proven yet in the courts ... so when is Ben going to discuss the details of those lawsuits on his podcast? 
We all understand that if Ben attempts to debunk the election lawsuits, then he will be written off as a Never-Trumper. This would obviously destroy the GOP with another #walkaway campaign.
The longer Ben continues to discredit the election lawsuits, the clearer it will be that Ben believes that Trump is lying. That is the only conclusion you can come to if you believe what Ben is saying. Sure you can argue that there wasn’t enough evidence of fraud to overturn the election, but where is the detailed analysis of that argument? Ben is deliberately leaving people with a sense of frustration because we already don’t trust the MSM and we expected a trusted news outlet like DW to address it. I wonder if Ben can even credibility advocate for real election reform if he continues to discredit the President like this. He can’t, because he betrays his audience with his silence.

@LolthsWowDk,Been - the part where people dont believe in the election was just the opening of the speach. The senator later explains many of the allegations of potential fraud and why the system needs to be revised. He was saying the government owes it to the people to review the processes that are viewed as being corrupt. Please do your research or at least give the full statements of the individuals speaking. I get you dont like how people are doing it - but they do have due reason to believe there are problems. Investigate it yourself - plenty of citizens and experts in the scientific data analysts field and ballot formatting have come forward and held meetings with the Senate to dispute it. Please stay unbiased  - gain your information and dont take senators speeches out of context to push your viewpoint.,1,2021-01-07T18:25:03Z,2021-01-07T18:25:03Z

Funny how when much more happens at the neighborhood business dwellings it is no big deal.  The people on the right just want the people in power know that they are on notice.  When the courts refuse to even look at things, where there is evidence to be looked at.  It smacks of being pussies from the very groups that are supposed to investigate these things.

NOW...  What's coming, will be forever blamed on TRUMP. The economy will plummet. Personal freedoms will be taken away. Democrats will do NOTHING positive as they always do. Tech companies will gain control of more personal information and our government sells our freedoms. The government needs to be redefined. Those prostitutes we call representatives need term limits.

@kennethslayor8177,"To ALL Republican and Conservative politicians, what I have just told my districts Representative in the House of Representatives is a message to all of you!

	The occupation of the Capitol did not do enough. You, our elected officials have failed US. You have failed to defend our nation, our people, our Constitution, and maintain the security for us and our posterity of our Unalienable Rights endowed upon US by our Creator. The appointed officers have violated the law to effect the unlawful seizure of our nation, and its occupation, by collaborators, agents, and sycophants of the People's Republic of China. The elected representatives of several states have stood by and done nothing while our election security was stripped away and our election stolen by our enemies, foreign and domestic. The courts have aided and abetted our enemies, foreign and domestic, either directly as they broke the law to strip away the security of our elections or through criminal negligence of their duty as they left our nation and our Constitution unprotected from our enemies, both foreign and domestic. The governors of our nation have in diverse places effected tyranny, effected the slaughter of our elderly, promulgated the slaughter of our children, and you who we elected to oppose them on issue after issue have failed to do what you ought to have done and have engrossed yourselves in things that have avoided real issues with some few exceptions.

	If you had done your jobs, as you ought to have done your jobs, we would not now be a a nation occupied by those that loathe the Constitution, seek to silence us through Big Tech and the suppression of the First Amendment, seek to eradicate our traditional religions, seek to impose false definitions in our language, seek to force us to participate in their farces of sexual deviancy, slaughter over a million American children a year, promoted violence in our streets daily for months, bailed our domestic enemies - their boot soldiers, out of prison repeatedly (which we know you will not do for your constituents), they covered up sex crimes until they were too blatant to avoid (o, and Epstein didn't kill himself), they seek perpetually to disarm US so that we cannot defend our nation and Constitution from their tyranny - and now you will not be able to prevent it, they deny due process of the law and have rendered all attempts at a lawful and rational democratic Republic impossible. And while they have been tyrants, sold US out to the People's Republic of China, invested in the terrorists that are blood enemies of our nation and our values, and devolved our national ethics to the point where infanticide is now legal. They have effected segregation, promoted racism, promoted sexism, promoted ethnophobia, promoted anti-religious sentiment to the point of establishing Atheism as the default national religion, denigrated our heritage, taught our children to despise and loathe our Constitution, our Nation, our heroes and heroines, promulgated abuse of women in the ring by delusional and deranged men who got to beat them up by calling themselves women, sent men who commit rape to women's prisons, censored those sounding the claxon, harassed into unemployment and total disenfranchisement those that did not kowtow to their ever shifting Marxist agendas, and when caught committing crimes which breached national security and rose to the level of felony offenses walked away without a scratch.

	What have our Republican representatives done? They have mildly and weakly said, ""No. Don't - stop,"" like some bad 1970's joke about date rape. I am as furious with you as I am enraged by them. If I were not disabled and unable to be of service in this defense of our nation made necessary by the failure of the Republican Party I would have myself been a part of those that occupied our capital today. And I would not have walked away but stood my ground until my blood was splattered across all of you where it should be. Make no mistake. If I had the blood of angels, demons, or the demi-gods of myth in my veins I would shatter mountains, raise oceans from their bed, sunder continents, and smash suns into the cities, both foreign and domestic, of our nation's enemies. Our complaints our legion, our patience - long suffering as it has been, broken, and our anger just.

	Do NOT scold us as if you are our mother. FIX our nation by re-securing permanently and forever our unalienable rights and eliminating our enemies by whatever means is necessary. As they have not obeyed any rules or laws in the process, and use our tendency to obey laws as a weapon against us, it is no longer the time to ""play nice"".",0,2021-01-07T18:19:57Z,2021-01-07T18:19:57Z

I really can't believe he compared this to 9/11....especially after atrocities we've recently witnessed on a domestic level, not citing any party affiliations but the weeks & weeks of riots and looting, the resulting deaths and the CHOP situation in Oregon.....

Very questionable..I understand the foundation for the logic...I just dont think that it was an appropriate or well-grounded statement...at all",0,2021-01-07T18:17:22Z,2021-01-07T18:17:49Z

@jonnyfive5000,I agree with Ben. The hypocrisy from politicians and lack of leadership and the lies the promulgate are for their gain and hurt our country. They’re still healthy and rich and in office while the American people are divided and upset and scared. I believe most people want out of this horrible cycle. Biden or trump won’t get us out imo.

Seems like a lot of these people love Ben for his rationality and bluntness, until he says something they don't like. Ben is NOT. A. SELLOUT. He is condemning criminals for breaking the law, committing violence and soiling the conservative name. That WAS a riot, and those people committed a FELONY by breaking into the United States Capitol, desecrating and disrespecting the most sacred halls of our government. What those people did was disrespectful, disgusting, unsophisticated and lawless. Protesting is fine. As soon as they started to commit crimes, that was when they crossed a line. We conservatives need to do better. They stooped to the leftists' level. If we hold a standard for the leftist riots, we must maintain that standard for our own party or else we are hypocrites.

Second of all our cities have been burning all through 2020, many more hurt killed, police buildings being taken over, with very little of the people being arrested, antifa blm, some of which were inside the capitol and caused alot of the photo-shoots you see. The police let them in, they pulled back the barricades, also the antifa group broke off and busted into a window to get in.

This could be unifying if we could just denounce the violence together. Why do you need to move to denouncing people's views?

I thought violence was the language of the unheard. I know the difference here is that you disagree with the motivation. But try to imagine having perceived injustices that remain despite official rulings to the contrary. Even beyond that, to have elected officials up to and including the president (when of the party you voted for) tell you that those rulings are only due to systemic bias. I know it can be hard to put yourself in that position, but maybe try really hard before denouncing more than just the violence.",1,2021-01-07T18:05:25Z,2021-01-07T18:05:25Z

@jake1492Nelson,"What I don't think you get is that the alienation that has occurred on the left to trump supporters has lead to their empowerment and now trump supporters are saying no and after seeing that this tactic worked for the left have adopted it into their own.  They saw the left condone antifa, riots, lockdown, etc and the right do nothing, they saw the right crumble to the left yesterday, therefore they no longer feel backed by republicans.  Also with no voice and nothing to lose they will revolt.  The clamp down will only fully make trump supporters feel more unrepresented and the ONLY thing that is holding this country together and not leading to an outright rebellion is a lack of organization and unification.  However I do not doubt that people will find a way to unify, people are smart, and when this happens the blow back will be extreme.  I also believe that until they do you will constantly see domestic terror peak to unheard of levels as people feel that they both have nothing left to lose and second are not empowered or heard at it-this could be to a truly massive level given how many people feel disenfranchised.  This will of course only lead to more clampdown and the whole thing will become cyclical.  The left made clear they don't want to get along over the last year and the right yesterday made clear they are willing to bow down to the left.  The left didn't care if the entire system burned and now neither do Trump supporters.  They are like the left and not the right and dont bow down ever-just as the left has done for the past year they will look to change the rules and do whatever is needed not worrying if the system breaks because the system doesnt work for them anyways.",0,2021-01-07T18:04:32Z,2021-01-07T18:04:32Z

What if there's a third party not Democrat and not Republican that's pushing racial diversity to Catapult us into another civil war. Somebody always comes out on top and there's always financial gain to be made. So who's making the financial gain if things get pushed in that direction? Are they the ones that's feeding the left and the right the b******* to hate each other?

@Amaranthos2,"Watched the entire thing yesterday, from the morning rally to the protest to the altercation to the senate shitting on America all night. 

This is how you whip people into a berserk frenzy. This is how you REALLY invite violence. This is how revolutions ignite and spread like wildfire:

Steal our voices, control all aspects of our lives, prevent us from working, make us dependant on handouts and then give us pocket change, beat us till we protest and then shoot us for it. ...And then have our own elected officials, supposedly our own voices, lecture us for hours about how shamefully ignorant we are to have been brainwashed by a despotic president.

We do not have Americans in government. I watched as only five people...Kennedy, Hawley, Cruz, Marshall, and Tubberville...upheld the objection, and the other 93 rejected it. I then proceeded to be physically sick in the bathroom at work after listening to hours upon hours of treasonous grandstanding against the President, America, and citizens. 

This thing is ON. If this is not a call to arms for We the People, then nothing is, and we should all just stay home and accept our fate.

I don't know about anybody else, but the only word I'd use to describe this feeling is patriotic bloodlust. I no longer want to see people in jail, I want to see blood in the streets and heads rolling. The Tree needs watering.",2,2021-01-07T17:50:28Z,2021-01-07T17:50:28Z

@mackgilbertson7436,"Trump betrayed the Republican Party. He only cared about himself. And by doing so, he made GOP senators, representatives and the Vice President chose between him and their morals, opinions, and democracy in general. If they honored the people’s vote, they would be seen as traitors to Trump loyalists. He single handedly lost senate majority for republicans by making the Georgia senators run on a platform based on him saying that the election was fraudulent. He discouraged republicans from voting by telling them it was rigged. He put loffelor in the position of saying she would object to the electoral vote. Basically telling her voters that she was going to disregard their verdict, not a great way to get them to turn out for you. Had she not, Trump loyalists wouldn’t have voted for her.

@jackmurphy7552,"Let's have a reminder of what led to this horrible event:
Years of lies and gaslighting from the corporate media and politicians. A year of economic shutdown and forced mask-wearing. A year of violent life wing rioting costing 2 billion in private property and months of public property vandalization being excused by the media at best and condoned at worst. Antifa rioted last night in Portland. It took an unconstitutional election process due to widespread mail-in voting with video footage of voter fraud in Georgia along with a ton of irregularities and sketchy data and a ton of corruption exposed in a myriad of swing states. It took the Democrats seizing all three branches of government with open plans to pack the court, add states, ban guns, eliminate free speech, mandate government-run healthcare, end our energy independence, and hike taxes. It took four years of a conspiracy against an outsider taking office and an impeachment but because president wanted to look into money laundering in Ukraine. And Capital security couldn't hold back a few hundred people months after Washington D.C. was on fire during the George Floyd protests? It also took a President-Elect whose family has received millions from the CCP on record, along with a video of Hunter Biden trafficking and abusing an under-age Chinese girl. Media brushed it off as ""Russian disinformation."" It took a Chinese agent Eric Swalwell in the House intelligence committee. It took a handful of Soros funded district attorneys prosecuting law-abiding citizens while letting violent felons run amuck.

@danhair,"Honestly Ben Shapiro, I know that you are going to blame this all on Trump and Republicans should be the nice guys that willfully walk in chains and the gulags with a smile on their faces.
 Your're going to go for that: we have to be nice to live in this country, which is completely contrary to what you said after the November elections; Don't be nice anymore... 
 You're going to make the case that we should all shut up and let the Democrets steamroll over the country AGAIN and excuse a Republicans Party that is so old and dispassionate that it's actually a miracle that it keeps existing.

@D_M_e-rg2ml,GOP is done for years. The media will play this on repeat and say anyone who votes for the GOP are the same as the people that stormed the Capitol Building.

@plotshift,For years Ben has criticized Trump's rhetoric but given him a pass because of policy. He acknowledged Loeffler and Purdue were bad candidates but backed them because of party and nothing else.
