@tmuxie,"Are you kidding?  Not once in either of the rally speeches you played did Trump incite those at the rally to walk to the capital and cause ANY violence! Yes he was angry and exercised his right to free speech about the election and said let's walk to the capitol and  support our senators and the vice-president to do the right thing, PERIOD. Not once did he ever say cause violence.  Now you might say it was an angry crowd what did you expect would happen? Well when people get together to protest they are obviously angry about something. It doesn't mean they are all there to cause violence or that ANY are there to cause violence. A non violent protest can be held as has happened many times. There were peacefull protest by angry people over the killing of George Floyd but some of those were hijacked by bad actors and turned into riots where people were killed, businesses were looted and burned, and government buildings were occupied. Are you saying that the people who organized THOSE protests should charged with inciting riots? In fact, people that were arrested in those violent protests were actually bailed out of jail by left or democratic political  organizations. I don't hear that happening with the violent capitol protesters and it shouldn't. They should all be in jail and prosecuted by the law just as all the other violent protesters for George Floyd or violent protests against inequality. You can't have it both ways, it's ok for one side but not the other. Violent protests are never a solution for social discourse no matter what side you're on. If you really think Trump incited that riot, and I invite you to tell me his words where he says lets go to the capitol and cause violence, then you have to look in a mirror and apply the same to Antifa or BLM or who ever led those violent protests over the summer.",0,2021-01-23T17:31:26Z,2021-01-23T17:31:26Z

@carlovanelli1694,"David: ""And that is exactly what they did"".

Actually, that is not exactly what they did. The mob caused violence, something Trump never told them to do. In fact, you conveniently left out the part where he tells people to protest peacefully and patriotically (this is a symptom of a fake news outlet).  

These are Trump's exact words from the clip you played.

""So we‚Äôre going to, we‚Äôre going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we‚Äôre going to the Capitol and we‚Äôre going to try and give ‚Ä¶ The Democrats are hopeless. They‚Äôre never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we‚Äôre going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don‚Äôt need any of our help, we‚Äôre going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.

So let‚Äôs walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all for being here, this is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.""

How exactly did he incite violence? He told people to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, and give Republicans pride and boldness. The incitement of violence is in your paranoid head.

@gregluce5948,"I'm a moderate conservative.  I don't like Donald Trump.  I didn't vote for Donald Trump.  I think this whole thing about the election being stolen is just so much garbage and I wish Trump would go out with some semblance of class.  It's just not in him though.  He is such a disappointment.  But David, in your video above, why did you leave out the part where Trump said to the crowd: ""everyone here will soon be marching over to the capital building to PEACEFULLY and PATRIOTICALLY make your voices heard...""  Why did you leave that out?  Why?  WHY?  It's a critical part of the tape; yet you decided, obviously, that it weakened your narrative of the President inciting riots.  You lose all credibility when you don't tell the essential elements of the WHOLE truth.  As glad as I'll be to see the scalawag in the White House gone, it's people like you, and Sean Hannity, and Chris Cuomo, and Rachael Maddow, and Rush Limbaugh, and Don Lemon, and Laura Ingraham, and Brian Stelter, and Glenn Beck, and Anderson Cooper, and Judge Jeanine, and George Stephanopoulos, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. who are the real problem with our country today.  YOU ARE ALL TURNING US INTO TRIBES!  What you report or comment on has many truthful elements, but you only show us what you WANT us to see in order to drive the narrative that you WANT us to embrace.  The news media in general are the true inciters here.  It's been that way for many years now and it's getting worse and worse and WORSE.  The damage that the news media (on both sides) is doing to our culture is far, FAR beyond anything that the man-boy in the White House has ever done.   Those idiots who broke into the Capital deserve to be thrown in jail for a long, long time.  Period.  But I live in Oregon.  My brother lives in the Seattle, Washington area.  I saw people attack and try to set fire to federal and state buildings (along with dozens of businesses) in Portland night after night, week after week, month after month, doing far more actual damage than anything that happened at the Capital.  And the governor and the mayor were afraid to take the kind of measures really needed to stop the riots, the kind of measures that YOU now insist be taken with the Capital rioters.  The hypocrisy is staggering.  In Seattle, my brother watched a group of crazies take over a police precinct with crazy demands while the mayor essentially sat back and did nothing, describing it as a ""Summer of Love.""  A few days later a teenage boy was murdered during that Summer of Love.  Only then did the authorities do something about it.  And I'm not saying there isn't bigotry, but this stuff was all described by the left wing media as ""mostly"" peaceful protests.  A police precinct was burned down in Minnesota.  Thousands of businesses across the country were burned, damaged, or looted by people who were just as bad if not worse than the idiots at the Capital yesterday.  But media people on the left side of the political isle, while giving lip service to the condemnation of law-breakers, were not nearly so enraged about months of burning and looting, as they were about what happened during one day at the Capital, even though more lives were lost collectively and hundreds of millions of dollars in damages were incurred, not to mention all the people that were thrown out of work when their businesses were burned, ransacked, or looted.  In spite of COVID-19 and the ridiculous antics of Donald Trump, 2020 will go down in history as the year that the two biggest lies in our country's history were perpetrated upon the American People--and tens of millions of us fell for them!  Lie number one (fervently believed by tens of millions of conservatives) was that the election was stolen.  Although there was some evidence of fraud and certainly many irregularities, there was nothing even close to the amount of fraud that it actually would have taken to have thrown the election to Biden.  It would have been a conspiracy involving thousand and thousand of people.  It's SO ridiculous.  But millions of conservatives bought it hook, line, and sinker.  They believe it with all their hearts.  This has sent relations between Republicans and Democrats to an all time low.  It's pathetic.  Lie number two (fervently believed by tens of millions of liberals and leftists) was that white people in America are all essentially racist at heart and further, what are actually no more than basic human rights are now being described as ""white privilege.""  I've never seen so much pseudo-social science rubbish in all my life and it's destroying our country.  But millions of liberals and leftists bought into this colossal canard with every fiber of their beings.  This has sent racial relations to the worst levels EVER.  To summarize all this:  For myself I can only try to figure out the real truth by watching and listening to both sides of the media and then trying to somehow sort it all out.  it's a real challenge sometimes, especially because I have a tendency to WANT to believe wholeheartedly what I hear from the right.  But although it's taken a while, I think I've gotten pretty good at sorting out the ""truth"" from the underlying political narrative--on both sides.  But unfortunately, most Americans have subscribed to either one side or the other.  They either believe everything that Fox and others like them spew out, or they believe everything that CNN and others like them spew out.  IT'S TURNING US INTO TRIBES.  And you, David, are a part of the problem.  I hope you will not (like so many on the left or right would do) dismiss what I'm saying out of hand.  I hope you and others reading this will have the courage to really think about the points I've made.  Respectfully yours, Greg in Oregon",0,2021-01-09T10:53:49Z,2021-01-09T10:53:49Z

He said: The media both liberal and social are liars . He labeled them FAKE NEWS. He was right.
He said: Russian collusion was a hoax. He was right.
He said: He could bring manufacturing back. He was right.
He said: If we build a wall and manage immigration it will create jobs. He was right.
He said: Joe and Hunter got rich off of shady corrupt deals with the Ukraine and China. He was right.
He said: new trade deals would be better for the people. He was right.
He said: Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be the right decision. He was right
He said: getting us out of un-winnable wars would create peace. He was right.
He said the Clintons were corrupt. He was right. And still are!
He said: locking up minority‚Äôs for decades for non violent offenses was wrong so he changed it. He was right.
He said: Jobs are worth way more than welfare so he gave the people jobs.

@tomw4643,There is a solution that even Trump will agree to.  Execute the 25th Amendment based on mental stability.  This will immediately give him exemption from further criminal prosecution because being mentally unstable will be the perfect defense for almost any criminal charge.  I think Trump can be made to see this as an opportunity to avoid criminal charges.  This immediately removes Trump from doing further harm.  It avoids the impeachment process and the Congressional scramble to vote on the articles of impeachment.  It also will focus the reason for removal away from trigger issues that his supporters might react to.  This ends it quickly so that we can get on with the healing.  It is the best possible solution.,0,2021-01-07T22:47:29Z,2021-01-07T22:47:29Z

However, if you were a lawyer, you would understand this phrase is in reference to judicial combat...not physical combat.  Don't believe me...go look it up and educate yourself. In addition, Trump stated ""peaceful and patriotic"" protest.  People have twisted what was said to fit their narrative. It is irrelevant if you are Democrat or Republican...nothing in this video incited violence. If this video was played in a court of law to charge Trump or Rudy on charges to instigate violence, it would be thrown out of court.  Love him or hate him, Trump did not instigate or incite violence. This is a lie and the video of Trump's speech proves it.  If you're going to make an allegation, you better have substantial evidence to support it. I don't blame Democrats who never spoke out on the violence of BLM and antifa riots hurting people and the police in big cities...and the destruction in Portland, Seattle, and other cities around the country. I don't blame Trump for the actions of criminals who did this. The guy who made this video clearly can not look at the situation from this perspective due to his own bias.

Jan 6/7 2021
Armed insurrectionists wound up by trump & his son at the oval this morning marched on the capitol & proceeded to violently force their way inside- arriving at the Rotunda they then began to smash their way into the Senate & House Chambers- at that juncture 1 woman was SHOT DEAD- they were successful in taking the SENATE & for approximately 1 hour history will record that the United States of America had fallen in a violent coup fermented by a sitting POTUS refusing to yield to the CUSA mandatory & prohibitive directives that guide the PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER- make NO MISTAKE regardless of the LIES told to you by many co-conspirators of this attempted coup... one whereby POTUS waited in the wings for it to succeed & be accepted before ""safely"" riding in ""triumph"" to claim an illegitimate victory for a 2nd term- the States were given a clear & unequivocal PLENARY POWER under the RESERVED POWERS of the 10th Am CUSA to make & enforce the rules for how to select electors for POTUS- as such the FINAL COURT of remedy/relief & arbiter of any/all such disputes is the STATE SUP CRT regardless of the UNLAWFUL decision Gore Vs Bush 2000! There IS NO STANDING in SCOTUS to attack directly or collaterally any State CERTIFICATION of ELECTORS by any party or any sister state of another state- EACH STATE is an INDEPENDENT STATE whose rules are determined by them & by them ALONE- no sister state can interfere in another state via collateral SCOTUS attack & no state has standing to overturn its STATE sup crt decision in that regard- the REASON Judges were so pissed off at the giuliani clown car is that Judges are LOATHE to step off the bench to be the lawyer for a party at CAUSE & yet to AVOID the very thing trump was stirring up that was unleashed Jan 6 2021 the Judges went ahead & OFFERED these idiots THEIR THEORY OF THE CASE- Q: ""WAS THERE MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD""- to which in 62 out of 62 cases [1 for 62 in trump ""winning""]- THE ANSWER WAS NO- this was done because absent massive election fraud- A CRIME- there is simply NO THERE- THERE how do you lawfully overturn the election results in MULTIPLE STATES- only 1 way PROVING MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD & yes THEN filing an ORIGINAL JURISDICTION ACTION at SCOTUS- THAT IS THE ONLY WAY & YET despite being told to take meds & that I was crazy for over 1 month I have asked the trump team & his idiot ""base""heads- show me evidence & SHOW ME AN ARREST- POTUS is EXECUTIVE- it IS his JOB to arrest in such instances [conspiracy of massive election fraud in multiple states & apparently 1 foreign country germany- yet even after saying they seized a server in germany ZERO ARRESTS???] So no arrests & CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS by POTUS & YET ALSO NO CLAIM OF MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD at state level to establish evidentiary canon for Original Jurisdiction case & NO ACTUAL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION CASE FILED- ZERO ALLEGATIONS UNDER OATH IN COURT matching the B*LLS*HT LIES in public maybe now you know the reason Judges are LIVID & HATE trump- maybe now you know the reason I have been making the comments I have tho heavily censored on youtube & Fox while being vilified by trumps idiot ""base""heads- this was looking like another CON by the conman to get guiliani 20 grand/day in BS legal fees & trump throwing a grenade on his way out of the tent- NOPE that NI66ER was hoping that their would be a MAGA uprising & enough Repubs would side with his B*LLSH*T as we witnessed all night until 3:15am DC time when FINALLY gohmert exhausted the last objection to Wisconsin with NO Senate vote to back him- IF that armed insurrection & repub BS LIES attempt at quiet insurrection via OVERTHROW of the 10th Am in COTUS when they resumed after insurrection put down/failed via too little support- had gone differently then RIDER ON THE STORM [HE CREATED] trump would have declared Marshal Law OR rode in to claim victory on a populous take over via armed insurrection of the US gov't- THIS IS TREASON & the 25th AM MUST be invoked immediately with an immediate vote in house 50-50 + 1 & Senate 2/3rds- THAT NI66ER MUST BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY HE IS A CLEAR & PRESENT DANGER ESPECIALLY SINCE ALL THESE DUNCES DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS UP TOO & how many TRAITORS like:
Cruz Tx, Hawley Missouri, Hyde- Smith Mississippi, Kennedy La, Roger Wayne Marshall Kansas, Tuberville Bama... and majorie taylor greene/ lloyd smucker/ fred keller/ yvette herrell/ jeff duncan/ brian babin/ ted budd [nc]/ cammack/ arrington/ clay higgins/ jeff van/ drew/ roger williams/ madison cawthorn/ mike kelly- etc that he still has working TREASON- INSIDE THE GOV'T FOR HIM
NO JOKE 25th AM... DO IT!
I have stills via yt vid shot of the armed thugs having taken over the SENATE of these United States of America replacing the Stars & Stripes with TRUMP FLAGS & CONFEDERATE FLAGS- these secessionist zombies are NOT patriots & they GOT 4 ppl KILLED TODAY I don't care who pulled the trigger & how those people DIED- IT WAS ARMED & VIOLENT INSURRECTION DIRECTLY INCITED BY & PRE-PLANNED BY TRUMP & HIS IDIOT SON & IT SUCCEEDED FOR AN HOUR- just before they stormed the COTUS TRUMP TURNED ON HIS OWN V-P & THAT WAS THE SIGNAL TO TAKE OVER- THIS WAS TREASON- you can persecute me for 30 yrs torture me make me homeless destroy my health smear me to justify it & attack me multiple times mace me beat me incarcerate me illegally for the crimes committed against me steal everything I own multiple times KNOWING I AM INNOCENT & THE THUGS YOU SENT ARE GUILTY yet you can't arrest a TRAITOR & the co-conspirators in the SAME Capitol Police that tried to kill me on the steps of the SCOTUS all to stop my TOTALLY LEGITIMATE SCOTUS CASE- THAT I HAVE PROOF WAS OBSTRUCTED & yet you let them same metro & capitol police stand aside & watch & wait to see if their Giant Orange Psycho Clown Career Criminal & Child Rapist can pull off the coup before deciding which way to jump- DISGUSTING!
The LEAST U can do is REMOVE the NI66ER NOW- 25th Am he kept BOTH houses at it for damn near 24 hrs fine now YOU gather for 24 hrs & REMOVE THE NI66ER- they want to record votes when the NAYS have it in the House THEN YOU RECORD THEIR VOTES & ENSURE EVERY REAL AMERICAN KNOWS WHO SIDED WITH TRUMP & WHO SIDED WITH CUSA on Jan 6 2021-

@MrAdamNTProtester,"PART 2 of 2
PS just so you know reason their is NO CUSA violation: THAT IS AN ABSURD CONSTRUCTION- UNDER CUSA 10th AM the STATES have RESERVED POWERS acknowledged ONE such power explicitly stated in CUSA is PLENARY POWER of the State(s) to make & enforce rules governing how to select electors via the populous exercise of the franchise- IF there is any impropriety, lack of following rules/ State Con etc etc THAT CASE ARRIVES AT THE COURT OF FINAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN STATE SUP CRT- THAT IS THE FINAL DESTINATION & NO COURT & NO OTHER STATE CAN DISTURB THAT DECISION- the LEGISLATURE of the STATE can IMPEACH State Judges, pass new laws or even hold a convention to adopt a new con am- HOWEVER the people MUST vote with their feet if unhappy with the State exercise of power- IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO NOT have what we witnessed today- when the people are LIED to by repubs for 1 1/2 months about how the system works so that it IS as if there IS NO SYSTEM WORKING then you see the wisdom of the founders & framers in ensuring such heated disputes stay at the STATE level ISOLATED FROM ANY OTHER STATE DISPUTE instead of conflating issues in sister states & having the whole enchilada blow up- JUST AS TRUMP PLANNED FOR TODAY... FACT & TRUTH- IT IS TREASON-  How many times do you socialist red commie b*st*rds DENY that State(s) have POWERS [NOT RIGHTS] so that you can NOT defend against THEFTS OF ELECTIONS [2001] & COVERS FOR COUPS [2021]?!!? Seriously are you ready to say AMEN to CUSA now you retarded imbeciles... CUSA IS a THING you know! So that ni66er is lucky you all censored MY ARTICLES of IMPEACHMENT against him that I drew up to win Larry Flynts 10 mill dollar offer 2016/ 2017 [he was joking obviously a publicity stunt] since they WOULD HAVE DONE THE JOB- instead pelosi inoculates him against impeachment with her BS ukraine gate phone call & russia gate BS thinking he would be so bad it would get her back into power & he could be managed- her & McConnell think they are smart they are DUMB & TRUMP PROVED THAT TODAY- as long as they have their earthly cornbread crumbs of wealth power & ambition satiated who cares about TREASON insurrection & starving, unemployed homeless people RIPE FOR TRUMP TO WIND UP LIKE MISSILES JUST AS HE & HIS RETARDED OFFSPRING DID TODAY- If I had my case heard & I had ANY SAY EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO: 
BRANDISHING WEAPONS VIOLENTLY ENGAGED IN THIS INSURRECTION GAINING ENTRY TO THE CAPITOL & THEN SMASHING THEIR WAY INTO THE SENATE CHAMBER- RESULTING IN THE MURDER OF ONE WOMAN [& 4 deaths total] WOULD BE SHOT FOR TREASON- NO JOKE- so no State can claim standing against another State directly, no person or other can claim standing against their or another state directly & NO STATE CAN COLLATERALLY ATTACK another STATE at SCOTUS as TEXAS ATTEMPTED TO DO recently [with over 20 sister States Joining]- the CERTIFICATION of a SLATE of ELECTORS by a STATE IS CUSA- IT CAN NEVER BE UNCUSA- that'is straight up ridiculous & all those treasonous snakes in BOTH Houses who said amen to this to cover for & if successful reap the benefits of- ARE GUILTY OF TREASON via ARMED INSURRECTION!

FINAL WORD on these dummies NOT ""knowing"" the LAW & then parlaying their ""ignorance"" that is absolutely pretend ignorance into TREASON with a defense of ""stupidity"" if caught in their back pocket & full expectation to reap the power rewards calling themselves stable geniuses when they succeed:
ALL 50 States & DC CERTIFIED their ELECTORS- FACT & TRUTH
THE ONLY TIME COTUS has any say IS WHEN a State or multiple States DO NOT CERTIFY THEIR ELECTORS- THAT IS WHEN COTUS can then proceed as YOU saw today- by various methods:
1. Deal making/ brokering as in past- a POTENTIAL POTUS & 3 NON CERTIFYING STATES;
2. COTUS debates on which slate of electors to acknowledge;
3. Sending the issue back to the State(s) NOT CERTIFIED with a DEMAND WRIT stating- either CERTIFY a SLATE- DATE CERTAIN BY Jan 20 2021 for CUSA inauguration to take place OR lose your electors in the calculus of which POTUS CANDIDATE WINS date certain count by Jan 20 2021 at latest!
So NO ONE WHO OBJECTED TODAY DOESN'T KNOW THIS- they are ALL TRAITORS whose loyalty is to trump & their own ambition wealth & power lust- 
THEY ARE ALL >>>TRAITORS-<<< FACT & TRUTH- IF NOT REMOVED-they will commit TREASON AGAIN!
IF MY CASE HAD BEEN HEARD & I HAD A SAY => PUBLIC EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM & THEIR CO-CONSPIRATORS IN THE CAPITOL & METRO POLICE & IN EXEC IN COTUS & ON SCOTUS!
There was NO THERE- THERE & NEVER WAS- which is the REASON over a month ago I was posting the youtube video of MISSING PERSONS- DESTINATION UNKNOWN in Fox News Comment sections explaining all of this & being smeared... ridiculed & censored... some of them KNEW what was being planned viz the PRE PLANNED well in advance by POTUS- COUP attempt IN ADVANCE & his ""base""heads executed that PLAN on Jan 6 2021! FACTS & TRUTH! 
IT WAS A PRE-PLANNED COUP & the DC Metro & Capitol Police were 100% INVOLVED- letting it happen & putting the good cops in harm's way BTW- while they waited to see if it would succeed... FACT & TRUTH!
May GOD condemn to hell forever all who through their action(s) and/or inaction(s) helped this TREASON against the United States of America & continue to cover it up- rewarding the TRAITORS & protecting them so they can do it again... while persecuting the innocent all the days of their lives- AMEN

Firstly, in the 2016 elections Trump allowed treasonous foreign adversarial Russian efforts to interfere with US elections, as proved by the FBI.

Secondly, Trump repeatedly directed his cult following publicly and on Faux News, etc. NOT to vote by mail-in-ballots that ultimately sabotaged his own candidacy.

Thirdly, Trump publicly directed his own cult following to show-up at the US Capital to fight for his candidacy. Their own actions sabotaged his would‚Äôve been 30(+/-) Republican efforts to object Biden‚Äôs President-elect‚Äôs victory, and to overturn Trumps loss.

Albeit, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs impeached presidency‚Äù and already failed his oath of office to protect Americans in more ways then one.

Trump and those involved should be face recognition‚Äôd by the FBI, to be federally prosecuted and imprisoned.
