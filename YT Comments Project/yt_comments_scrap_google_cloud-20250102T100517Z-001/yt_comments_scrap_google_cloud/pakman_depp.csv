@jadedspades,These specific statements were not defamatory.  They were non specific phrases taken out of context.  I don't particularly care or like either of these people but I do think as a matter of law they should have both lost their claims.

@seanspreckelsen3496,"I'm pretty shocked that the pakman audience didn't see through the pr going on in this case. The trial never should have been publicly viewable while it was happening, especially in a case involving abuse. By all accounts, if you listened to all the witnesses, experts, and timelines, you would come to the conclusion that they were both abusive to each other, yet you have a ton of people villifying heard and bending over for depp. Several law experts have already written articles talking about this being the biggest pr comeback in American history. That is all this was. It was depp being loved for his movie persona/charisma in court and people not being able to see through that. I'm guessing most of the comments are trolls, but who knows. This trial was good for no one and most likely set back women speaking against their abusers by decades. This was a lose lose situation and people are cheering

And again, as I said earlier, regardless of how you believe the trial should have gone, this was a dream for the populist right. Huge victory for them. And no, I'm not just talking specifically about the verdict. I'm talking about the endless attacks against heard, the way the trial was served to the public, etc. Women who have come forward about abuse have always been vilified throughout history, but this will cement that. The tiktok assault of clips was on another level.",0,2022-06-02T12:16:31Z,2022-06-02T12:31:27Z

@misterderp4566,"Unless I'm mistaken, you have it backwards, David.  I was kinda tuned out but from what I understand, the judge RAISED the punitive damages paid to Amber Heard from $0 to a minimum of $350K.  I'm not familiar enough with the jurisdiction in which this was decided to say for sure, but it would be fairly unusual, in my experience, to cap punitive damages.

EDIT: Yes, I was mistaken, just heard it wrong while paying half-attention.  Apologies.  I still think it's weird that Georgia would have such a small cap on punitive damages...this is going to require more research!

@seanspreckelsen3496,"It's unfortunate that a well documented, witness driven case that found amber heard to be telling the truth, was destroyed by a well organized social media attack on her. This puts justice for women who are victims of assault back decades. The fact that people now believe she hit herself, that she busted her own lip and pulled out her own hair, is insanity. Depp is charismatic. He played a bunch of young people and those people spread meme clips all over the place to push the falsehoods. I am by no means saying that heard was not abusive as well. It was a disgustingly toxic relationship. But to be completely on one side, especially with the well documented substance abuse by depp, witnesses coming out of the woodwork to talk about his abusive nature, etc, is bat shit crazy. It's insane what some of these movie stars get away with in the public's eyes. Make no mistake, this was any alt right supporter's wet dream",13,2022-06-01T19:53:10Z,2022-06-01T19:54:17Z

@ItsjustBeth-wk6qi,I’m so glad the jury saw through her. She spit in the face of women who have actually been in abusive relationships. I hope Johnny has gotten or is getting the help he needs to live the life he is meant to live. I also hope this helps give a voice to men living in abusive relationships. You deserve to be heard and believed. ♥️,137,2022-06-01T19:45:10Z,2022-06-01T19:45:10Z
