STOP thinking of domestic abuse in terms of ""WOMEN = VICTIM"" - this attitude does more damage to all victims of DV than what AH did. smh

@SisuGirl,"This is absolute abhorrent. I was in an horrific 4 year relationship (We were both Law Enforcement) & I was scared. One of the worst scenarios was when he punched me in the face; dead center on my nose. He destroyed my nose, orbital bone, my teeth were embedded in my skin‚Ä¶not to mention in front of my babies. I never knew how much blood could come out of my face. It spattered like a gunshot. I became so violently ill-the pain of vomiting is indescribable.  Oh, lucky me. He drew me a bath. The water looked like it belonged in the movie ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äù. He came in and asked how I was doing‚Ä¶my nose wouldn‚Äôt allow me to speak correctly so he became furious telling me to hurry up because there was blood all over. (‚ÄúWe‚Äôll never get our security deposit!!!)
SO! When I see/hear women like Amber Heard, my blood boils. I certainly did not walk around with my BFF laughing & joking. The day after I was assaulted, I was at the hospital with 2 eyes swollen shut, a tooth lost, my nose mangled. The very last thing I thought about was going shopping & drinking Starbucks.
It‚Äôs been awhile since this happened but I live with it every single day. I have had my nose re-broken 3 times and maybe one more soon (I can‚Äôt breathe through my left nostril).
I do not advocate female victims. No. I 
advocate for those who are abused. My heart is with every man, woman, & child.

@tigerlancer,"Amber turd is a moron. Before Aquaman, she got $14.2 million from Depp, signed a clause not to defame each other. Didn't donate a dime to aclu and children's hospital. They didn't say jack about not getting their contribution. Was bankable and reputable and able to get parts respective of her stature and ability.  

After Aquaman and the op Ed piece comes out, johnny Depp sues for defamation and pulls out all of the evidence he had and reveals she never paid a dime to charity to this day. Reveals her manipulative ways through the recordings where she thinks she can change history through mind fuckery. Revealing turdmeister's adulterous lewd and lascivious behavior. Now johnny Depp gets all the money back he lost in the divorce and then some. 

Now, by all her own machinations in trying to become an 'A' class celebrity, by stealing from and discarding Johnny Depp's star power, amber turd finds herself back at square 1, before she stepped foot in Hollywood, but now, she's 20yrs older and with the most sullied of reputations.

@itsjustdamian,"WHY IS SHE STILL ALLOWED TO BE ON AIR? If there were audio tapes of a man saying the stuff she has.. and a jury had found that man to be a horrible abuser.. then you can guarantee that man wouldnt be given a platform to continue spreading more lies.. he would be outcasted from the media, yet they keep giving her a platform to spread more lies. It is so unfair. If I was on tape saying ""I wasnt punching you I was hitting you"", because Im a guy you can guarantee nothing I say would matter after people heard that.. but shes allowed to try and twist what happened and say she was forced to admit to things she didnt do. Im sorry but you can hear hours of JD being submissive and begging to stop fights and her saying he should always stay even if she is being physical.. its clear cut.. not 20 second tapes but HOUR long tapes.. and she is trying to gaslight the world saying that none of that was real. So apparently shes being honest now infront of the world.. but in a secret audio tape between just her and JD with JD being calm and normal.. thats when she was lying to save her life? While she was verbally abusing him on those tapes she was actually saying those things because she feared for her life? She was saying things that if you said them to an abuser.. would actually risk your life? It doenst make any sense. We know its lies and this is so sexist and unfair because I know if it was me on those tapes.. I wouldnt get any interviews.

@gailremp8389,I don't watch Fox News. As you can well tell probably. But I don't think the jury went home and turned on social media to find out what was going on. I truly don't. That's making an assumption that everyone does exactly as you would do. And there are people out there that are ... gasp ...calling have scruples and integrity. I think the verdict to fair. Amber heard was an abuser... And those of us that are victims of domestic abuse are glad that it's finally been showing that men can have the crap beat out of them also.  Amber word heard was an abuser. And if we dig deeper we find out she doesn't have to put up all of that money if she wants to go with it. The problem is she just can't let go of the fact that she got caught as an abuser. And he's not whooping it up in England. He's over there trying to get his life back. Is that a problem?

These woman were true victims of domestic violence, so very sad and heartbreaking. 

When I think of Amber Heard, I think of Jody Arias, Casey Anthony and Shayna Hubers who murdered her boyfriend Ryan Poston who was an attorney from Kentucky.  Amber Heard, Jody Arias, Casey Anthony, Shayna Hubers are a text book example of narcissism and sociopaths.  They are so evil and disgusting!!  I don't believe prison would be good enough for these monsters!  I think they need to be executed.  We don't need people like this in this society and it is a societal tragedy that they try to hide behind true victims of domestic violence!   I am so happy that Johnny Depp won this trial.  It's about time we get some justice in this country.  However, I think he should of got more than 15 million, he should of at least got 50 million plus.  If  Amber decides to appeal this case, I guarantee Johnny will win again and she will pay more money to him and more people will come forward in support of him and they and Johnny Depp's attorneys will also get a nice hearty sum of money and Amber Heard will end up rotting in jail for life for perjury and libel!  And that is her personal tragedy that she has created. I pray that Kate James will also sue Amber Heard because she too was a victim of her.  She would definitely win her case and if I were her and Johnny, I would sue that trashy pig for 200 million plus!!",1,2022-06-07T23:45:33Z,2022-06-07T23:45:33Z

@rubygreby1473,"This panel is ignoring the fact that AH was entitled to $32.5 million in a California divorce from him, but she was so anxious to get away from him that she settled for $7 million & pledged it to children's hospital & aclu & was beginning to make payments when she was sued by JD. She had to pay her attorneys $6 million. Why would she risk her entire livelihood by falsely accusing him? Could it be that she really was a victim because he admittedly had blackouts during his drug-fueled rages & did not remember abusing her in certain moments. His drug & alcohol addiction caused him to not even function at times, & when he was trying to detox he would become a raging monster he said. A loving, kind man does not write & send vile, misogynistic texts & emails threatening to hurt AH. JD was & is an entitled, spoiled, controlling, vengeful, Hollywood elitist who still has mental problems & blames AH for everything. He has never taken responsibility for his own actions. He needs to call off his minions -- the millions of troll bot JD sycophants who keep harassing her online. Am so disappointed in Judge Jeannine & others who call AH a liar when they, obviously, do not know all the facts. Shame on them for being so judgemental to someone who needs support. I hope that AH gets the love & support that she needs to overcome all of the liars & haters & jealous twit troll bots out there.",0,2022-06-07T07:03:09Z,2022-06-07T07:03:09Z

I don't think Amber has $10.35M in limits, but she could have $5M plus essentially unlimited defense costs.

@spunstelele,"I find it peculiar because Depp sued the Sun in the Uk trial and Heard was 3rd party. It was the SUN who won the case and not Amber Heard.

Heard published the ""defamation"" article in the Sun. Depp seems to have lost his pirate role around that time, maybe because of the article maybe not.
But he got other roles including in Fantastic Beasts so his career was doing fine. 

For some reason though he suspected the article in which his name was not mentioned was the cause for the loss of his Pirate role, even though nobody gave him a clear reason and neither did he ask anybody. So it is speculation.

Depp did not only accuse Heard of being a liar and that he did not abuse her but in fact that she was the abuser.

Since Depp's career seemed fine the court found Depp's claim of the article destroyed his career wrong. The court did not believe his other claims either. He believed Heard instead. 

Heard was required by the court to send all the evidence she had but was not the direct cause of him losing the case. The loss of the case led to him losing his career. Not the article. I do not know why there is no discernment.

The conclusion is that it was Depp's own vanity and a wish to make some millions that led to the end of his career. Maybe he was the gold digger.

It looks like everyone is a little confused and lost track of what this case was about. Including attorneys.

Amber's lawyers seem to suggest this kind of info was suppressed in the US court case. It was not a similar case either. Neither did Amber's team win. I think her attorney got ahead of herself by posing as the winner, or maybe there was a lot of nervousness and pressure around this case too with so much media attention and focus only on Amber (as the alleged liar and abuser). Nobody bothered to look at Depp.",0,2022-06-06T14:19:13Z,2022-06-06T14:19:13Z

@marywilson4938,"She never should have gone for the TRO or Op-Ed.  She was an equal part of this toxic, scrappy, volatile relationship.  They both lie, they both abused each other.  However, she started it by taking it public when she was just as guilty of it as he was.  (Can you image if she just got a divorce and went for half instead....this is not a healthy, thinking individual...)   Anyhow,  I believe her career is ruined.  I think they both should have walked out owing each other nothing.  No, they did not believe her lies, neither did I.  But they didn't look at Depp or his lies....or his behavior.  Nonetheless, I think the public should look at the fact that she has a baby and is single.  We all act like we are humane and virtuous, but everyone wants to conveniently forget about this child.  (She did it to herself - is all I hear when I bring up the child.)  I don't give an F that she did it to herself - we STILL can't forget about the child.   Tormenting Amber could not be healthy for the baby.  Also tanking her finances would not be healthy for the baby.  (I know - she brought it on herself....but where do we draw the line.)   Depp said he wasn't in it for the money and he doesn't need the money.  He did very much contribute to this mess.  HE PICKED HER and MARRIED HER with all that crazy by both....   He is more likeable, yes.  So what.   Even abusers have good sides about them.  In fact, many narcissists are known to be charming and likeable.  Just a fact....    I think it would be very nice of Depp to waive the verdict of fees owed to him.   I also don't like Amber - but just let her and her child be.  Let her go on and pick up her life.

@missd7013,"AH made some bad mistakes. First she was entitled to around 45 mil going by community property laws, and the income brought into the marriage during the short marriage. Stupidly she listened to her PR agent instead of her divorce attorneys.She should have taken the money and NEVER pledged anything to the ACLU etc. A stupid PR move, and it was just more unnecessary filler at the trial. Charity is elective, and her income did change after that pledge. She knew the Uk trial would cost her a lot, and let's face it your lawyers are going to get paid first. Still it's elective and shouldn't even matter.
Again I would have quietly gotten divorced and wished him well, no RO either. A lot of PR she was working against herself and JD sadly...and yes it all backfired.",1,2022-06-06T13:24:40Z,2022-06-06T13:24:40Z

@bishop23d,"In my opinion, yes what she did to damage Depps reputation is wrong and deserves the verdict she got. However completely removing her character out of Aquaman 2, is excessive because she does play a good role as Princess Mera in that movie. The movie is about to be released soon anyway so Warner Bros might as well release the movie as is and take the possible loss of people not wanting to come into the movie to see Aquaman 2, possibly becoming a box office bomb. What WB is doing is damage control and if they think removing her from the movie is going to save their movie, that's not gonna happen and people will still not come to the movie anyway because of the stance they took and casted her in the movie anyway. How many movie stars that got divorced and they went through a lot of crazy stuff too, even normal people get divorced and go through the same crazyness too. Their only problem is as far as Depp and Heard goes is that they broadcasted it on TV. We all know she has a problem but still, making movies and outside of the movie industry are two different things. Don't take her movie career away from her.",0,2022-06-06T13:15:28Z,2022-06-06T13:15:28Z

""From a Brit - a couple of things I want to say about The JD trial in the UK. 
The judge was completely out of line ‚Äì he‚Äôs was friends with Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun newspaper, and the son of the judge worked for the author of the article in the Sun. He should've been honest and told this to the court, recused himself from the trial because of a clear conflict of interest.  I have no doubt that he interfered and this was why Johnny Depp was also refused an appeal.  JD should come back, if he wants to make it a clean sweep, show the information - which is now in the public domain here in the UK - to the courts and again ask for an appeal, as it's clear the judge should not have sat in judgement of the trial.  However, I also completely understand why he would not choose to go after  Heard, Elaine and the British courts again.""

I believe the UK judgment should be totally annulled/retracted due to the evidence now proving that trial was inaccurate, and served to permit the slander of JD to stand and continue.",1,2022-06-06T00:58:57Z,2022-06-06T01:15:47Z

Not only that but some commenters have posted on other sites that the UK Judge involved  is KNOWN to make judgments founded on bias and ignorance of evidence, and claim he has done so in those hearings!  But apart from all of that, how come Heard's 'lawyer' is getting away with, as I believe it is, contempt of court, understood by the law globally?  Surely such a high-handed act to put herself above the legal finding of a duly constituted law court, should be stopped immediately?  She should be prosecuted.  She has no right to simply 'continue the hearing' according to her own ideas and lies!  It's as if she's just totally trashed the verdict, the court and the Judge and is putting HER opinion above the lot!

In that case she would say the jury did a wonderful job as did the judge. Only because it goes against her clients favor are the jury suddenly swayed with social media. The world recoiled at AH because it was obvious she was lying. Not because she was a victim accusing a famous man. I wish they would get off that already.",0,2022-06-06T00:24:45Z,2022-06-06T00:41:25Z
@Adamface26,Everyone has seen this case on TV and we all know Amber will never win any case now that we have all seen what we saw.  And we all saw all the lies she told and how she reacted or tried to act like she was crying but very horrible acting by the way.

I understand she's just been trying to do her job but Eleine, please don't keep making excuses about the obvious fact that Amber Heard lost the case. .Amber Heard is a big liar, a bogus, a vile person who set out to ruin a human being.  A human being with his faults, with his difficulties but who would never have abused a woman,like she is saying  !!!   Social media have nothing to do with the evidence that Amber Heard is a liar who perjured in 2 courtrooms by telling the false ... I'm writing from Italy and I assure you ,dear Eleine, that being able to follow the trial live, not only has it greatly helped us viewers in understanding who of the two was really lying but it also helped to be able to be more then sure of having in front of us a shameless witch... a woman who maliciously created a very serious defamation ad hoc to take revenge for the fact that Johnny Depp wanted to leave her.  A very evil woman who also  has really big psychological problems, as various doctors have declared ... a thorn in his side who unfortunately ruined his life in the blink of wings... Life from day 1 Johnny Depp met her ,became a nightmare for him .  It is really pointless for Eleine to go around your broadcasts to justify this loss and to cover up her client ... we all know that the fault of this defeat is not about Heard's legal team but the obvious fact that defending a real guilty and lying person is practically impossible.  Eleine must put her soul in peace ... social media and all the excuses she finds to justify their defeat have nothing to do with it ... even a 6-year-old child, unaware of everything, would have immediately understood that Amber Heard is a a liar and vindictive woman.  They, as her legal team, should have told her, indeed forbidden her, to pretend to cry ... since she is totally unable to do it ...

@AMCGH17,"I disagree, this is NOT a step back for the Me-Too movement. It‚Äôs a step forward. The Me-Too movement now includes EVERYONE. This is a triumph for the Me-Too movement because men get abused too, which goes even more unreported than with women because of the stigma that men suffer. 

JD is a perfect example of this! He suffered for MORE than 6 years and only decided to tell the truth and go to court because of his children! AH was abusing him even during their honeymoon. Furthermore, AH taunted, mocked, and dared JD to ‚Äúgo tell the world that he, a MAN, was a victim of abuse‚Äù and further mocked him by adding; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see who they believe.‚Äù 

She expected that the world would believe her just because she was a woman even when the ‚Äúmountain of evidence‚Äù was against her! She expected that he would continue to take her abuse quietly, as he‚Äôd done the previous years. This is NOT about fans of JD, this is about fans of the TRUTH and JUSTICE.

Johnny Depp is the REAL representative of the Me-Too movement. I am glad he had the courage to tell the world the TRUTH. I am glad we saw the ‚Äúmountains of evidence‚Äù that exonerated and vindicated him completely.

How disgusting....truth is she is an abuser and has major psych issues. We heard and saw! Stop victomizing her! JOHNNY was dropped off his  movies and had so much damage  to his career  and income  based on calims! Claims! Yet now that he won some are still to victimize  the ABUSER because  she is a woman!...yuck. ..p.s I'm a woman and wasn't  a Johnny's  fam till this trial.

@expandinguni,"I saw the Depp and Heard trail and its clear to me from the testimonies, texts, pictures, audio and video that Depp is also deeply troubled and very abusive in many ways. He asked for camaras on the trail because he promised Amber global humiliation. In my view they both lost and both were humiliated in public. We saw how miserable their lives are. It confirmed once more how fame, sucess and money having little to do with wellbeing and health.  I am very sadden by the ruthless media campainge agaist Amber and, even worse, by the unecessary agression against her from people on social media. It makes me sad to see how rotten our society is and how easy most people are manipulated by the media and celebrity.

They also had a false sense of confidence in the evidence they were presenting. Looks to me like they did not do their homework  and threw it all together the nights before and hope it would fly.

All it takes is one lie and the jury will discredit your testimony.  The jurors saw right thru AH.  Why Elaine let her go on the stand and continue to lie, that is a very poor lawyer.  Elaine either did not advise AH or AH just wouldn't listen.  AH buried herself and rightfully so, she had been lying for the last 6 years.  Where is Rottonborn?  Why is he not appearing with Elaine?  He has to be totally embarassed with having to sit there and witness AH's behavior on the stand.  Elaine is trying to blame everyone else instead of admitting AH was guilty and deserved everything that was handed down to her.  Elaine needs to go back and watch a rerun of the whole trial.  Elaine is upset that she not only lost the case but she exposed herself to be a poor lawyer. Elaine was so outclassed by Team Depp!",0,2022-06-05T07:01:16Z,2022-06-05T07:01:16Z

  Personally win or loose the press she got was so negative that I doubt she ever works on a reputable movie again.  I could see her getting DVD style work if you catch my drift.

@Mysterio-Solar,"Look folks , Amber will Appeal this Civil Judgement just to buy time . Here's what's going to happen . Remember when OJ got sued in Civil Court by the Goldman's ? He got raked for 33 Million dollars . What did he do to circumvent that Judgement ? The Goldman's got his Brentwood , Ca house and all of his Football Memorabilia in the house . That was worth about between 5 - 10 million dollars . But other wise OJ hasn't payed a dime to them since in the last 25 years  . He took 4 Million dollars , and put it into some sort of Trustee Retirement Account that basically will give him 25,000 dollars per month for the rest of his life . He was able to do this because he claimed he was unemployable which wasn't really a lie . So this money would be looked at as his only income to survive . The money is basically untouchable by any Collectors , or Civil Judgements .   

Johnny will never see a dime of this 15 Million judgement as Amber wil probably copy this loophole in the system that OJ pursued . Don't be surprised if she takes about 10 Million Dollars and puts it into this Trustee Account claiming this as her only income , being unemployable . Or another scenario is she just takes whatever money she has made , and moves to a Spanish Speaking Country claiming that is the only place she can get work , since she does speak fluent Spanish . Johnny would have a tough time Garnishing any incomes she would get in those Countries .",1,2022-06-04T20:56:32Z,2022-06-04T21:06:13Z

Then I read that Amber has a history of being violent and abusive that dates back to her childhood.

@diane4488,"Amber's attorney should be ashamed of herself.
I doubt very much that she believes a word of what Amber had to say in court, yet she herself comes out and tells blatant lies, to the media.
The UK and the USA case are totally different.
The newspaper only had to show that he'd been accused of violence - which he had, by Amber.
Which is why he's had to sue Amber for defamation of character. If he didn't, she could continue making false claims, without penalty.
We all saw Amber lie over, and over again - plus pretend to be upset, crying, and even sobbing - without one tear! 
She told many blatant lies, and as pointed out, if a witness is shown to lie, how can you believe anything else she says? 
Even the claims that were not proved, were either not corroborated by other people who were present, at those events, and/or did not seem believable. 
This case has actually been a very POSITIVE result for all the people who have to tolerate these Borderline/Narcissist personalities, who tell malicious lies about others - to cause pain, and for financial gain. These personalities are incredibly evil, arrogant, and believe they can do/say anything, and get away with it.
They have no empathy for others, and seemingly no conscience. 
As a survivor of relationships with malignant narcissists, I am delighted that the world is starting to understand them, and see through their evil and malicious behaviours.

YES QUEEN! SAY IT AGAIN! Amber is the ultimate sign of disrespect towards all women AND men across the globe, who were ever abused (both physically and sexually). She will now forever be known as *Amber Turd.* She deserves every bit of the sh*t she's going through, because of the sh*t that she's put OTHERS through, but she likes to use it as ammo for her victim mentality; saying that she's a human being and doesn't deserve to be treated this way. Well I'm sure she wasn't saying that while hurting & abusing Johnny for all of that time... She deserves it because she has ZERO accountability for everything that SHE did to JOHNNY, and for all that she put him and his family through. She lied and played the innocent victim who apparently did NOTHING wrong, so she'll never get any pity from me.

She spits in the face of all survivors of domestic violence (both male and female) across the world. _(and apparently in the face of her therapists...)_",0,2022-06-04T17:49:00Z,2022-06-04T18:03:45Z

@ThePiratemachine,Yes but Judge every jury is informed they cannot consider media but who is unable to not be influenced subconsciously? Everyone is. Media should not report anything - opinions especially before a trial in any area. She's got the right to appeal if she thinks she's wronged. Maybe she is. An Appeal Court decides not the media opinions. 1000s of cases have been won on appeal and findings in lower courts overturned.

@davidjackson3818,"I was married to and then mercifully divorced an 'Amber Heard'. She had all the characteristics and more displayed by Heard. I was the victim of domestic and emotional abuse, and I was subjected to several episodes of violence. I told no-one for the sake of my children. I know exactly how JD suffered, and I recognise the pathological lying he had to endure, just as I had to. I recount much of this in my memoir 'Surgeon in the Raw' (amazon) and the similarities are breath taking. My account is verified by a detailed diary and recordings of my ex-wife's rants and rages. She vilified, denigrated and humiliated me in the Sun (once again similar to JD) and other newspapers for over 2 weeks getting paid a considerable sum for her life story. From my own experience, I can almost guarantee that AH is the product of what I consider, is a very debilitating personality disorder and JD made a bad choice, just as I did. Time for a 'He too' movement to protect vulnerable men or perhaps 'Me too' could reach out to men who have been similarly abused.  I and many others have a lot to thank JD for. As an aside, the High Court judges in my case said that if they had not listened to the recordings of my ex, they would not have believed my account.",1,2022-06-04T15:11:13Z,2022-06-04T15:11:13Z

@mbrights3158,"Her lawyer elaine used the argument that abuse victims will have to produce convincing photos and/or seek medical treatment to be believed. How truly deceptive that claim is! It is NOT that she didn‚Äôt produce photos, it‚Äôs that she produced SO MANY photos, with so very few showing any injury, and those that did, did not show anything close to the kind of injuries (aka swelling) that she would‚Äôve certainly sustained had the type of abuse she described occurred....and the very few she did produce of ‚Äúinjury‚Äù showed minor bruising type injuries that looked doctored, as well as what could‚Äôve easily been created with a ‚Äúbruise kit‚Äù (a term she accidentally used and she quickly corrected herself, again, key point‚ÄîNO swelling), and/or she could‚Äôve received a bruise from her sister, since she and her sister got into physical fights apparently on a rather regular basis, as well as her possibly accidentally being bumped in the process of assaulting Johnny...(which she very clearly admitted to doing multiple times, on audio).

And it isn‚Äôt simply that she didn‚Äôt seek medical treatment....(as many abuse victims do not, because they are afraid to or because they don‚Äôt have the means)... It is that Amber had a personal doctor and a personal nurse 24/7, and she was literally encouraged to seek treatment for anything and everything, in fact they even traveled with them.

Good Lord, why aren‚Äôt people calling out elaine on this totally disingenuous crap that she is spewing?

@darrellpowell6042,"The appeal will be thrown out because the legal team Elaine Bredehoft supplied all the evidence to support this case. There are NO extreme circumstances for an appeal. No failure of the judge's directions. No late evidence. 
No jury tampering to support an appeal. 
No witness prejury in public domain.
The appeal judge needs sufficient grounds to appeal, losing a case is no grounds of appeal.  IF they had won then all of these objections would NOT be a problem. Also they did 'win' one out of three counter claims. That alone means their case was judged fair and exact.

@shaithriel,"Wonder where she's going to get the bond to appeal?

In order to appeal she has to produce the $10.3 million up front.

Q: _""What is Amber Heard's net worth?""_ 

A: _""Amber Heard's net worth was $8 million just two days ago, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Today, Amber Heard's net worth is -$6 million dollars. Indicating a loss of $14 million in the past day.""_

So, Amber is now in debt for millions of dollars, and her reputation is tarnished beyond all redemption.

Amber Heard is now a byword like _""Nimrod.""_

_""Don't be a Nimrod, or in this case, don't be an Amber Alert.""_

Had she just shut her mouth, she would've kept all the millions that she was awarded in the divorce, which was $7 million, but no, she had to attempt ruining Johnny's life with fictitious, _'Domestic Violence,'_ allegations, because she's evil.

Sometimes purely vindictive women, amp¬∑utate their own fingers in the process of twisting the knife, because they just can't control their hateful, and spiteful natures.

@BusyBooksByAaron,"Although I am on Johnny‚Äôs side 100% and I am glad that he won (he‚Äôs no saint but he was abused) I felt sorry for her. I can‚Äôt imagine the kind of childhood that left her so mentally unstable. Not making excuses for her, just trying to understand how she became this terrible, abusive person. When she didn‚Äôt win, for a minute I thought she might commit suicide because of the immense humiliation she experienced. Instead, she decided to appeal‚Ä¶. Not feeling sorry for her anymore. 

I am a victim of abuse, not by my husband but by my stepfather. I can tell you that even though so many years have passed, I still can‚Äôt look him in the eye. I am still terrified of him and I have not confronted him. Her behavior was very odd. She definitely came across as the abuser. About 9 years ago, a psychiatrist said that it was probable that I have BPD. I had to stop therapy because of insurance issues so I wasn‚Äôt formally diagnosed. I looked up the symptoms and they do fit me. Just being honest here even though it‚Äôs embarrassing. The thing is that I made changes. I looked for healthy coping skills. I asked for help. I did this because I want to be a good mom to my kids. I want to break the cycle. I want to be able to say ‚ÄòI did everything within my power to raise happy kids‚Äô. Having BPD is not an excuse to act the way she acts. She needs to accept that she has a problem and look for a solution, if not for her, for her kid.",0,2022-06-03T17:37:59Z,2022-06-03T17:37:59Z

Tough.
 Get a second job...
 That is what men are told in every situation where they are court ordered to pay an amount to a woman.
 I hope Depp doesn't feel bad and forgive her debt to him, because everyone knows for a fact, she would never do it for him.
 He should also go after her and her original legal team for extortion in the UK case, and try to get it overturned where they all have to give everything they extorted from him back.
 Then go after her for violating the NDA when she wrote her op-ed.

Only Amber has affected her domestic abuse status. Not every abuse victim in the world.

So ridiculous that people give Amber Heard any credit for being someone who matters in the world of domestic abuse victims. 1 person lol.....but because she is a ""
celebrity"" its significant. Celebrity is a grossly inaccurate term for her and the only reason it can be remotely applicable is because shes been in a few movies.

@susanjackson7528,I am neither a dp or ah fan but because of ill health I was able to watch the trail all of it ! I came to the conclusion that she was lying based on the evidence presented. If he hit her so badly so often and she took so many pictures of her life why didn't we see the evidence why didn't her own friends and Dr's see evidence. Abusers can be male or female victims can be male or female. I listened to the tapes (why did they record so much of their lives) it was her own tape saying the world wouldn't believe jonny depp if he told it he was beaten by a woman. That says it all. Main stream media are spinning this I wonder how much of the trial if any they watched. Now they blame the jury.

But in a way now she has just proven that men can be abused as well. I don‚Äôt follow celebrities because I really don‚Äôt care about their lives & just by watching clips & not the actual court proceedings even if I do I know an abuser when I see one & she definitely was an abuser. She makes me sick & Amber you just ruined your own career because if you are able to get a movie part I don‚Äôt plan on watching it.

@vividdylan400,"Regardless of anything, Elaine Bredehoft is gonna get a lot of clients. Such lawyers get more clients than the ones who take the cases of innocent, even if they are really good. Someone guilty is definitely phoning up Elaine's assistant. And believe it or not, considering how poor Amber performed on the stand and that they had no evidence, Elaine was still an effective lawyer, especially her and Rottenborn's closing arguments. Another point is that guilty people might hope to go free, but in the back of their minds, someone like Elaine could at least lessen an otherwise harsh sentence.

In short, Elaine, as a lawyer, is pretty intimidating, to be honest. And to come to interview right after the verdict and still act normal shows how hardened she has become.",0,2022-06-03T12:50:33Z,2022-06-03T12:50:33Z

Stop it Amber, stop it now. Be quiet and you may have an opportunity in the future to redeem yourself. Right now you are just insulting the majority of sane people.",24,2022-06-03T12:00:43Z,2022-06-03T12:00:43Z
@bethwebster652,"I‚Äôve never understood why people lie, they lie knowing full well they‚Äôre lying, they know you know they‚Äôre lying, but still look you in the eye and still lie.  Yes Amber most definitely hurt and did tremendous damage to women of suffer from domestic abuse.üò°. It‚Äôs difficult enough to live thru it and even when you come to the point of telling others what your life  was like. You‚Äôre judged and told how stupid and wrong you were to put up with it and how they would never allow that to happen to them, let alone you mentally beat yourself up for allowing it to happen as you always thought you would be strong enough to never allow that to happen. Bottom line Amber H. with her nonstop ,evil , narcissistic disgusting lies will cause so many heartbreaking and unfortunately dangerous/deadly repercussions for victims who truly suffer at the hands of an abuser.  My prayers are for true victims of DV and also for the little baby girl that AH has in her life. This child will most likely suffer both physically and especially mentally as she will be considered a possession and as ‚ÄúOWNED‚Äù and will be blamed for anything and everything that doesn‚Äôt go as AH wants it to go.",0,2022-06-03T11:59:37Z,2022-06-03T11:59:37Z

Depp should be allowed a retrial in the UK.

@Valelacerte,"Elaine Bredehoft attempting to relitigate the case on TV really annoyed the legal community and all her arguments were BS. 

1. Johnny Depp's win didn't set back women's credibility in IPV cases, but Amber Heard's false and malicious physical and sexual violence claims did.
2. No evidence was suppressed. It was either deemed insufficient or inadmissible by the judge or simply didn't exist. 
3. Elaine Bredehoft cites the UK case and Amber Heard's medical records as examples of evidence that were suppressed. However, the UK case was between Johnny Depp and the Sun newspaper, not Amber Heard, and was in a different country and jurisdiction. Amber Heard stated in her testimony that she had no medical records of her alleged injuries and her therapist merely repeating Amber's claims was dismissed by the judge as hearsay. 
4. Amber Heard stated multiple times in her testimony that she wrote the 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she claimed to be the victim of domestic violence and sexual assault two years prior, a time when she was married to Johnny Depp. So, no one needed her to spell out that she was talking about Johnny Depp. 
5. Amber Heard's free speech rights have not been denied. She has freely and publicly portrayed Johnny Depp as a wife-beater for years. She didn't care about freedom of speech when she counter-sued Adam Waldman for defending Johnny Depp publicly. 
6. Most major trials are televised and discussed on social media. It is not Johnny Depp's fault that his family, friends, colleagues, staff and fans are loyal, likeable and have nothing but praise for him. Amber Heard's sister, Whitney, was the only person to physically attend court in support of Amber and even she was allegedly abused by Amber. 
7. Elaine Bredehoft is like Amber Heard's mother. Nothing is their fault; it was Johnny Depp, the prosecution, judge, jury and the public's fault.",1,2022-06-03T07:40:36Z,2022-06-03T07:40:36Z

@goodlowe6532,"So....generally speaking....survivors of actual abuse, by nature of what makes them targets to be abused, generally aren't the type willing to go through the trouble of suing.  One character trait that makes us victims is the fact that we don't easily stand up for ourselves, we also forgive immediately and look forward hoping our abusive partners are the same and will change.   This is what allows us to be abused for long periods without leaving.   If we were the type to sue and stand up for ourselves we would have left after the first or Second fight........

Therefore....the idea that people suing are faking is a rare thing?  No, I think absolutely many of those suing are actually the abusers and are actually using the court system as another form of control and abuse over their victims.",0,2022-06-03T07:01:19Z,2022-06-03T07:01:19Z

She shouldn't get away from all this cos she's a woman. 
And i hope the Judge reprimand to censored Elaine's mouth with these disrespectful accusation, making all these mockery towards her and the jurors, heck the American Justice.
It just doesn't sound right she could just say all these things, I mean what kind of a Lawyer are these?

@castlerock58,"The Sun proved in court that Depp is a wife beater and the judgement was upheld on appeal. One of the reasons the appeal court denied Depp's appeal was that he admitted in court that he headbutted Heard.  Heard seems nasty and did crap in Depp's bed. That alone will probably wreck her movie career. Depp is a drug addict who was proven in court to be a wife beater. He admitted to violence in court. Circus put on in the US court does not change that but it was a huge PR win for Depp and a PR disaster for Heard.  Sun's case was proven in court by some of the best lawyers in the UK. 

The lawyers Heard hired in the US were no match for Depp's team. She is not very likable but good lawyers can deal with things like that. One thing I have never seen before is the judge allowing the plaintiff to have a hired gun expert diagnose the defendant as mentally ill. That did not happen in the British court.  British courts also avoid having circuses like this or the OJ case. The US system is more entertaining but I'm not sure if it delivers better justice.  In a televised trial Depp had the advantage of being a much better actor. He has made his career on his acting skill while Heard seems to have gotten into Hollywood on her looks. That probably mattered less in the British court. There, things like Depp admitting headbutting Heard had more weight.",0,2022-06-03T06:13:43Z,2022-06-03T06:13:43Z

@mneofthestate3515,"Very few are actually bringing up one of the more important points of this, the men who are the abused and the false accusations that turn that abuse into even deeper wounds that will never heal. it took me 5 years of courts, fighting by myself, me a guy who worked construction all my life had to take my own case after my attorney passed way 6 months into the custody case. I was accused of the most vile things and the judge believed them all until I proved each one false, then another, false, another, false. even with video of her assaulting me over and over. I prevailed and have been raising my son alone, I don't want to risk anything like this happening again. I don't have the money to put out on lawyers, and I am a single dad and all my son has, so I stay alone, 9 years now. Life in solitary, is what it feels like, but I am afraid of our legal system and I also learned that all she has to do is cry to a cop and my life is ruined even more than it is already.
i learned  with my first wife, to never get the cops involved, in any way, because the one time they were, and she even admitted I did nothing and she broke the phone hitting me with it. Nope, I was arrested, because, as they put it, I was ""the male and most likely the primary aggressor"". so for over 20 years I took whatever came my way and shut up about it. they said if I plead guilty, a fine and go home, she told the prosecutor that she did it and he said fine I will charge you both.

How about suing the ACLU for their Initiating the op-ed, naming Amber an ambassador when she hadn't even qualified due to pledging the donation but not paying even half of it, writing it for her, editing it, etc.  I mean, really, just go review that part of the testimony.  If that weren't enough, those scumbags filed an 80k against Johnny during the jury deliberations, thinking they'll cash in by charging 80k administrative costs for all their work creating the op-ed.  (how disgusting!) When you consider the timing, they must have thought, in their arrogance, that Johnny would lose and they'd have the opportunity to punish him more.  I'll bet they've already withdrawn the suit.  (Nothing to look at here!)

@africarain1671,"At a minimum, Depp being severely and frequently in an altered state secondary to substance abuse, is by default, abuse. It all has to do with the neurotransmitter, oxytocin, and when one is getting it from an outside source (ie, drugs), it subsequently makes one indifferent to the needs of others and  to their actions on others. This is why substance abuse is so destructive to relationships.¬†

This is all a shame. At a minimum they probably did actually love each other.  Heard's young age at the time of their relationship, her fierce ability to ‚Äústand with fists‚Äù and defend herself as a woman may have made their fights inconvenient and infuriating for Depp at the time, but that does not invalidate that she was on the receiving end of abuse nor that she is not the  primary abuser.  With age and wisdom, a woman learns to understand that the situation won't improve and to remove herself earlier, but she was young and in-love; caught in the middle of her fierce ability to fight for the relationship while juxtaposed to her fierce ability to stand up for herself.  Her voice does speak, louder then the media is giving her credit for. 

I actually do hope Johnny Depp addresses, at a minimum, his substance-abuse and how it affects others. And I do hope that Amber Heard knows that there are people out there that did NOT enjoy the trial at all,  nor how she was treated by these reported Depp-fans both in the courtroom and on social media.",2,2022-06-03T01:02:33Z,2022-06-03T01:02:33Z

@jamesf4405,"First of all,  the jury found that Amber acted ""with malice"". This means she cannot file bankruptcy to avoid paying the award to Depp. Second, because she acted with malice, in order to appeal, she must post bond of the total award plus attorney fees. This means Amber needs $11 million dollars just to file an appeal.  Her own attorney doesn't seem to know the law.",1,2022-06-02T23:11:21Z,2022-06-02T23:11:21Z
