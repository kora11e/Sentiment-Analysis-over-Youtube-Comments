@davidmangs6111,"FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA NOW THAT ASSAD'S MURDEROUS REGIME SUPPORTED BY RUSSIA, IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH WILL BE REMOVED! THE BRAVE SYRIAN PEOPLE PROVE THAT THE DREAM OF LIBERTY CAN NOT BE EXTINGUISHED BY EVEN THE MOST BRUTAL TACTICS OF A DICTATOR AND HIS AXIS ALLIES RUSSIA,IRAN AND THEIR PROXIES (ESPECIALLY HEZBOLLAH)

Prior to Russia‚Äôs 2014 invasion of Crimea, Putin had already learned in his support of Syria‚Äôs Assad and the use of chemical weapons in Syria (during President Obama‚Äôs term in office) that red lines could be crossed without consequence. Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah supported  the butcher Assad in Syria resulting in 613,000 Syrian deaths, Assad remained in power stealing from the Syrian people, and the Russians were rewarded with both a naval base and an air force base for Russia on  Syrian soil.. With the AXIS allied Assad, Iran had a base for its own military and its proxies (Hezbollah and others) to spread terror and violence throughout the Middle East. Assad became another allied corrupt dictator supported by, and allied with the AXIS(Russian, Iran, China and North Korea).
 The rapid advance of rebel forces in December 2024, has finally led to the collapse of the Assad regime after a bloody 54 years of autocratic rule. Syria will now have the chance to create a new future without Assad's cruel oppression which was supported by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.

Now is the time for western democracies to assist the Syrian people in creating the institutions that support a durable democracy, the rule of law, respect for minority rights, religious tolerance, and equal rights for women. Syrians must not let Shariah Law strangle freedom and democracy. Initially, the world must help Syria address a horrendous humanitarian crises, and then we must begin the long process of developing the democratic institutions and physical infrastructure that will support sustainable economic development so that the Syrian people will enjoy prosperity, freedom, and peaceful coexistence within their beautiful country and with their neighbors. 

THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BEGIN INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, AND GENOCIDE DURING THE ASSAD FAMILY DICTATORSHIP IN SYRIA INCLUDING THOSE COMMITTED BY RUSSIA, IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH.  THE SYRIAN PEOPLE DESERVE JUSTICE, AND THE WORLD HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE UNWAVERING JUSTICE UNIMPEDED BY THOSE WITH POLITICAL,  ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER!

THE CORRUPT DICTATOR ASSAD STOLE BILLIONS FROM THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AS THEY STRUGGLED IN POVERTY AND UNDER BRUTAL OPPRESSION. THIS ""BLOOD"" MONEY MUST BE RETURNED TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE UN SHOULD PARTNER WITH SYRIA TO REPATRIATE THESE STOLEN FUNDS TO SYRIA!!

Finally, Syrians must never forget that the AXIS powers and their proxies (especially Hezbollah) oppressed the Syrian people for decades by supporting their allied corrupt dictator Assad. Russia must surrender to Syria its naval base and its air force base after inflicting immense suffering on the Syrian people by destroying the country's infrastructure, committing war crimes(including the use of chemical weapons and the targeting of hospitals and schools), and acts of genocide, torture, incarceration, and murder.
Russia, Hezbollah and Iran can no longer have a political, military or economic presence in Syria, or they will certainly bring back war and conflict. David A. Mangs Ph.D.",0,2024-12-14T23:12:02Z,2024-12-14T23:12:02Z

@Davidpath9127,"‚ÄúThe Occupation of Water‚Äù amnesty international 
Soon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources. The Israeli state-owned water company Mekorot has systematically sunk wells and tapped springs in the occupied West Bank to supply its population, including those living in illegal settlements with water for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. While Mekorot sells some water to Palestinian water utilities.",9,2024-12-10T17:00:17Z,2024-12-10T17:00:17Z
@Davidpath9127,"Israeli human rights group B‚ÄôTselem reported : ‚Äú Israel is exploiting the West Bank to process hazardous waste produced in Israel. Any transfer of hazardous waste to the West Bank is a breach of international law which Israel is dutybound to uphold. Waste treatment in the West Bank is simply one more facet of the exploitative policy Israel has practiced consistently for fifty years now, using Palestinian space and people to further its own interests. Israel, taking into account its own needs alone, treats its waste in the West Bank and completely ignores its legal and moral obligations toward the Palestinian population there. Israel has turned the West Bank into a sacrifice zone, exploiting and harming the environment at the expense of the Palestinian residents, who are completely excluded from the decision-making process",49,2024-12-10T16:59:50Z,2024-12-10T16:59:50Z

 25 November 2021
‚ÄúSince occupying the West Bank in 1967, Israel has misappropriated more than 2 million dunams( 1 duman= 10763.9 square feet) of land throughout the West Bank. Israel has taken over some of these areas using official means: issuing military orders, declaring the area ‚Äústate land,‚Äù a ‚Äúfiring zone‚Äù or a ‚Äúnature reserve,‚Äù. Other areas have been effectively taken over by settlers through daily acts of violence, including attacks on Palestinians and their property. Settler violence against Palestinians is part of the strategy employed by Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime, which seeks to take over more and more West Bank land. The state fully supports and assists these acts of violence,",4,2024-12-10T16:59:11Z,2024-12-10T16:59:11Z
