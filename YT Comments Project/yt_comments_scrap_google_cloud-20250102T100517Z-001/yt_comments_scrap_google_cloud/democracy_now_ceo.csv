Humana would deny paying, the hospital admin come to tell her she has to leave. I would do appeals and while the appeal is pending my mother was allowed to stay and get physical therapy. I would win the appeal. But 2 or 3 days later, they would do the same thing and I would appeal again. We went around about this no less than 5 times. Finally, I switched her over to UHC which is what I have. Now UHC is denying basic things for both of us.

@Phillyformerpoliceofficer,What about me????  I have been diagnosed with a deadly decease and Ive never been a smoker.  Yet United healthcare care got paid and still is allegedly getting paid along with corruption hospital employees in supervisor administration positions. I've been waiting to have two surgeries for years. The hospitals are receiving payments as though they are provided me services when they're not every time my schedule an appointment for oncology and the insurance company is contact or appointments are canceled because I refused chemotherapy and learned holistic treatment that exposed the malpractice fraud extortion and retaliation is our father complaint to the hospital patients advocate department who allegedly use a complaint to have me targeted as the ultimate medical Records. Just recently last week Jefferson hospital and Einstein hospital administrators denied me a full copy of medical records. Due to the scam that was ran using a diagnosis is someone else use do you have prescription opium written under my identity.. after 12-hour surgery I awaken paralyzed on my right side I was coming out of anesthesia sleep and witness what they intentionally did to me. That was covered up by the registered nurse Martinez I cannot move my right side for weeks. This happened after Filed a complaint.  That was done let me know what can and did happen to me if I don't remain silent.. The corruption is connected to law enforcement and the city solicitors corrupt attorneys in Philadelphia Pennsylvania who have relatives who work for the department of human services as well as the hospitals and clerks in the judicial system some of them even our judges. Including those who work in the court system such as Court clerks and allegedly judges along with department of human services supervise the administrative employees.. having their scam has grown after the law allowed benefits for home health aide services to be paid to friends and family.. my identity is being utilized for other people to get paid as though they are providing me healthcare services and House services when they're not. They have allow others even from other countries illegal immigrants to go to the doctors under the benefits that was granted for me causing malpractice with other people's test result listed under my name that led to me being subjected to procedures that I didn't even need. As well as diagnosis to attack my character. After I became a whistleblower as a police officer my information was stolen from internal affairs and sold along with my pension. This been going on with me since the 1980s and it still has continued. Think about all the revenues it has been generated using corruption and fraud using other people's information intertwining it will false diagnosis what other people's diagnosis on the people like me identity call the our true medical need to be delayed because they are the ones who contribute to the confusion they create a situation so they can have an excuse to deny. Then they claim that you can follow a grievance and then they put stipulations after you file the grievance they change your address and your information so you never get the letter. And the letter is needed so you can respond to the letter if you don't respond to the letter they make a decision when you request an appeal to the next level and never get there they come up with depositions amongst themselves and your situation is deposed after being delayed you're completely denied as you try to hold on to life in pain even though benefits are there for you in your name the hospital Staff go along with the corruption cancel your oncology appointments falsify your medical records block your ability to receive any other care. State employees cancel your benefits each time you request an appointment to see an oncologist so that they can come you don't have the coverage. As the state and federal employees who's involved with the corruption go into the system placing erroneous notes changing your address to the address of the state buildings not a resident or PO box but to their own address which would be the social security office or the department of human services office and place a note in the system blocking you for for from correcting the erroneous fakest and then have a note on the system demanding your bank account information.

And from then until now, there has been no positive change or real healthcare reform. In some cases, it has grown exceedingly worse. What happens is that time has a way of  lessining the impact of a story or issue until it fades into darkness, only to resurface again at another time. Each time rising and falling like the tide, and taking with it any hope or promise for lasting change or reform. Right now, the story is about the man, not so much the issue behind the man. Do you hear of anyone addressing or charting a clear path for change? If the answer is no, then that means the tide will once again rise, fall, and fade into history. Most stories and people have only a brief impact in the limelight unless their efforts are consistent and progressive, which therefore can lead to change. Most explosive impacts have the potential to fade away like fireworks in the sky. And that may be the hope of the offenders.

@CommunistConsensus,"We are making a mistake calling it a Healthcare system. It's really an illness for profit system where every aspect of it is based on a business model.

Provisioning necessities to a society's citizens requires no profit seeking, and certainly no profit provisioning to the sociopaths that will collude with corrupt government employees to extort those profits.

The fact that congress creates the U.S. currency and determines where it is spent into existence (no taxation prior to creation required) tells us that congress has entered into a RICO extortion racket with the insurance industry. Read The Deficit Myth by Stephanie Kelton  for more details on the currency creation part. Profit seeking is not required in the provisioning process of necessities. The creation of private sector gatekeepers for necessities is sociopathy that leads to varying percentages of social murder.",1,2024-12-14T18:16:34Z,2024-12-14T18:16:34Z

@toomeyeh1,"I pray that this collective consciousness we are seeing, showing what an abject failure America's ""healthcare"" system is, keeps its momentum. It wasn't even an intentional ""cause"" that was encouraged or influenced by some social media campaign/legacy media _darling of the week_ obsession🫠. It doesn't have a lobbyist group and you can't join a local chapter... but somehow its members are in every big city and small town you know.

People are jaded with reason; nearly every person can relate to being screwed by a system that is designed for us to lose. A system where the stakes are more non-real money for the infinitely wealthy takers, and just literal survival for the exploited. 🤷 Seems like a fair wager to all traditional media outlets and even the NYPD smh.

America gets a lot of somewhat reasonable  💩 for not having universal/government ensured (no typo?) healthcare, but we have one of the, if not the, the largest government-run healthcare systems through programs like Medicare/Medicaid. Programs, like Social Security, that people under 40 may never get a chance to use before it is bled dry. 

These safety nets are being cleverly whittled away by death profiteers as they gut it for maximum shareholder profit. A profit that is driven by denying as many ""claims"" (another fun and pithy term we could use is ""request to use the insurance system they pay out the nose for to actually pay for life saving procedures and care""🤗🤗) as possible and charging as high of a premium as they legally can. That has *got* to change like yesterday. Please please don't go quietly about this one America 🫂🫂 we have more in common than these 🪱s want us to know.",0,2024-12-14T17:57:21Z,2024-12-14T17:57:21Z

@Instrument_of_Peace,"2 of my 3 sons were diagnosis with high frequency hearing loss at ages 4 and 1 respectively. The only qualified provider near us was out-of-network. For every appointment,  I had to submit a request in writing and then wait for the approval in order to schedule the appointments. They included extensive hearing tests with an Audiologist and an ENT. Also, various tests for the hearing aids. UnitedHealth care denied ALL hearing aid coverage, including the testing. UnitedHealth made us jump through hoops when they denying claims that were covered for the Audiologist and ENT. I'm sure many can relate! Turns out, the Doctors said they were denying claims 3 times before they would pay!! I know that hit the news! I was pregnant with my 3rd son when we found out my middle son, age 1, also had high frequency hearing loss like his older brother, 4 years old. The stress of finding this out was difficult enough without the nightmare of battling UnitedHealth care!!! We PAID a hefty month bill for coverage only to have it repeatedly denied. This was for a baby and a 4yr old. At a Critical developmental stage, expedition was vital. Then, The ENT and Audiologist helped us!!!❤ We participated in a research study since the odds of 2 children having high frequency loss was/is so high!! Over a million to one! We stopped receiving any bills! They became family! During my 7th month of pregnant with my 3rd son,  I contacted fifths disease from one of the children in my oldest son's kindergarten class at the graduation party. It only has potential dire effects for pregnant women. It required stress tests, lab work and extra ultrasounds. Thank the dear Lord my baby nor myself were effected. Fighting with UnitedHealth care was the last thing I needed. 
Every single person is effected by the health insurance corruption and has nightmarish stories!! It's time for a peaceful revolution, not revolt.  I'm ready to head to Washington DC to protest, and DEMAND REFORM! Take back our power and stop these vipers! Who's with me?!! Time they are reminded the people rule not the rich!! It's outrageous they have been getting away with this as long as they have!!! People losing their homes, can't pay their rent, college kids having to drop out, etc because of the medical bills! It's a blithe on our country!!! It wasn't that long ago that doctors made house calls!! It IS a right to have health-care!! Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness! Side note: I've been a registered independent voter for 44 years. This is NOT a political issue!! It's a basic human right of all!! ❤ I was just told yesterday by an independent pharmacy that they may have to close their doors. The insurance companies are not paying them!!!! The pharmacist explained that it's not just the independents, cvs and Walgreens are closing for the same reason! She said we are losing 1 independent pharmacy a day in the country!!!! The Mom and pop industry are the backbone of this county and are being snuffed out by the big corporations!!!! Not just pharmacies, grocery stores, small retailers etc. Time to take back our power!!!! THIS IS NOT JUST GREED, IT'S CORRUPTION TO IT'S CORE!!",0,2024-12-14T15:39:37Z,2024-12-14T15:49:27Z

@arthurhwang117,"He was surprised by the resources allocated to tracking down the killer of this one man ??!

This man was CEO of one of the major health insurance companies : he was one of the rulers, the high lords who wield power and influence in America and preside over its governance. You can kill a president, but you CANNOT threaten the forces behind the throne : if they did not hunt his killer down, NONE of the oligarchs and the plutocrats and the bankers who control the U.S., and by extension the Western world, and wring it dry for profits, will ever be safe again …. it would be open season  on the masters.

This is not simply about Denial of Care by the Health insurance industry. This man is a representative of the 0.001% that hold the levers of power : the hedge fund managers and bankers who drive you out of your homes and into the streets, the drug companies and food companies that poison you and falsify research results, the Utility companies that poison the rivers and deny ordinary people clean water, the corporations behind private education that put young people into a lifetime of debt and promote useless qualifications, the few politicians who really control Congress and the Senate and wield actual power, and so on and on.

according to one source, Americans spend almost twice as much as do Canadians.
Obviously the figures for developed countries include all the money spent by governments on universal public health care.
And yet Americans get very poor value for money as their life expectancy is significantly lower than that of people in developed countries.

It seems that wasting a lot of money paying for all the private insurance companies' profits and costs (wages, rent, utilities, etc) and paying health care professionals to spend a lot of time dealing with insurance forms takes a lot of money away from actual medical care.

The United States needs to bring in universal public health care and stop wasting so much money on private insurance companies.",0,2024-12-13T17:47:50Z,2024-12-13T17:47:50Z

@geofflepper3207,"Lots of people are expressing condolences to comfort the family of the murdered executive.

How many of those people have expressed condolences to comfort the family every time someone dies due to being denied medical coverage by a private insurance company?

The family of the murdered executive is no doubt suffering emotionally but presumably they've got lots of money and they're going to be just fine financially and will continue to live a very comfortable life.

On the other hand the families of people who died due to being denied coverage for medical care are generally in poor financial shape - 
otherwise they would have paid for the medical care themselves.

They often are in debt due to medical bills and often their financial situation gets worse due to the loss of an income earner in the family.

So the financial situation for families who lose a family member due to denied medical coverage is much worse than it is for the family of a wealthy executive which means that they are even more in need of receiving condolences than the family of the executive but no politician expresses condolences for them.

There's something very messed up with public discourse about health coverage and about who gets sympathy and attention and who doesn't.

Express condolences for the family of a murdered wealthy private health insurance executive if you want but only if you are also willing to express condolences for the families of all the people who died due to being denied medical care by a private insurance company because they are going through a much more difficult financial situation and they have likely watched their family member die a very slow, painful death over months or years.",0,2024-12-13T17:30:30Z,2024-12-13T17:30:30Z

We shouldn't have health insurance - excep for people who want extra.  No one should go broke trying to keep healthy.  Down with insurance companies.

@DntUTlkAbtAntHenny,"🔉🫡Luigi should receive CARE PACKAGES from around the WORLD!🔔💯🔔
🫡I am in💯✅️👋🏽👏🏽🤜🏽👍🏼👌🏽

UHC once told my very demanding asthma doctor ""No"" and denied a prescription inhaler that my doctor prescribed after (giving me weeks of SAMPLES) He continued to supply me with the samples because it worked so well...I felt like a new person and I could breathe...

The new inhaler kept me out of ER (experiencing triggers due to the severe weather changes with heat and airborne allergies, which caused my allergies to take me through such severe asthma attacks I would be admitted each time)

They replied to my doctor more than four times, and each time, he phoned them in between patients... I walked into the office one afternoon, signed in and I heard my doctors loud voice coming from his back office...He was yelling and cursing saying that's stupid, that's bullsht to make my patient go through that! We have already tried several different inhalers, and this one works damn it! My doctor fought for me, he screamed and yelled and each time they would reply with a denial!!!

They wanted me to do something called the 
STEP DOWN METHOD
(TRY 10 different medications)
As each does not work for a period of time, 3 weeks/month (move on to the next suggested medication)

🤬Meanwhile, I'm going to ER repeatedly because of dangerous asthma attacks and held over (admitted) for observation...This could be 3/4days each time also going to ER 2/3tms per week or each day and released after 6 or more breathing😂😊 treatments...

IF APPROVED for the medication that I needed...
The costs of ER visits and admission would have been $0...

🧐I am not saying Luigi was right.., However, I AM not saying he was wrong either..

@yvonnesmith6152,"It’s only within the first 12-24 hours that the MSM is covering an item closest to the truth. 
In this case, the insider trading shenanigans that UHC found itself in and that the DOJ was probing, was mentioned as a possible MO in the killing of Thompson. 
Thompson was subpoenaed to speak to the DOJ and there was the possibility and the opportunity for Thompson to name and shame the ones who participated in this fraudulent scheme. 
Also within the first 24 hours, Nancy Pelosi somehow came up when this insider trading case was still discussed as a possible motive for the killing. 
If Thompson would’ve dropped some prominent names, this would’ve definitely been the doom of someone’s political career. 
Then….just like that, the entire insider trading issue was dropped by all media outlets simultaneously. Poof….now suddenly we think this very wealthy kid, who has never known a day of financial struggle or strife, became a social justice warrior overnight. 
Mangione’s family owns nursing homes and has obviously no problem exploiting the medical disaster in this country as a personal business income stream. 
Another point not often touched upon is the fact that Mangione showed some serious skill during this killing. He masterfully managed this unwieldy gun, was able to clear jams quickly, and dispatched this poor man with just a couple of rounds. All the while, he stayed calm, collected and focused…strangely, his gunmanship or shooting expertise isn’t discussed. I’m pretty sure, anyone with some gun/shooting experience can agree that this kid saw some training. Why is that not discussed? 
We should all suddenly believe that this rich and pampered guy grew a social justice warrior persona? 
It is mentioned that Luigi “volunteered” at his family’s nursing home and came face-to-face with insurance denials and cold-heartedness. Well, you’d think he would bring it up to management and his family to see what could be done. 
Then we should suddenly believe that Luigi’s own medical struggles are at the root of his actions. If his lower spinal surgery had gone awry, then it would be the fault of his surgeon, not the insurance company…at least he got surgery and wasn’t denied this surgical intervention like thousands of Americans every year. 
Let’s not get into all the other little peculiarities, like the “manifesto,” him smiling for the camera, him keeping all contraband and choosing to remain in the same clothes….and how did he obtain the several “false IDs” he had on him? Were these driver’s licenses or passports? Within an hour of the crime, when his face hadn’t been broadcasted, he could’ve hopped on a flight. I’m sure the hostel, Starbucks and McD’s don’t accept Monopoly money (even though the US dollar is about worth as much as Monopoly money in real life 😆) 
Anyways, Democracy Now (not adding the exclamation mark in its name, it doesn’t deserve it any more) just parrots the boring line heard a thousand fold in the MSM echo chamber. Gone are the days when great heroes of journalism like Seymour Hersh and Mearsheimer spoke with this news program.",1,2024-12-12T12:55:31Z,2024-12-12T12:55:31Z

But to make an opinion and that is this guy was wrong he talking about he had back problems he talking about the health care at all help out that's just an overlay for the underlay that's not the real story here cuz it's not lining up right that deny or the bullets and this and that on them bullets don't factual right it just don't work out right something's missing get Rabbit Hole goes deeper than the average surface rapid hole get something deeper than that and it ain't about his back it ain't about denial that was put there I feel as an overlay for the underlay or what the real reason what he was killed for. And with the radical mass at this dude got he couldn't have never ever put that together to set up there and plot away to kill this man like that and get this kind of weapons and I know he had help and he joined a group of people and they thought they were smart enough to set up killing this man and they did but they had to do it in the most coldest evils way possible but it's more than him and and if anything God forbid go wrong with this cat yes cuz he knows something and he know he didn't work by himself cuz ain't no way he too cocky minded he too ill radical he just ain't ready not for that kind of capability he carried out know he was helped somebody helped him or some folks helped him but that dude didn't do all that by himself he's too he out of sorts he's too wired up and so as this case uncovers I believe it's going to be other people be exposed just like in the duty program I saw for all that stuff about people should feel a certain kind of way if they get denied by Insurance you don't need to qualifications who are people to feel like they got grandstand rights self-entitlement rights rise above any and everybody else so right that if things don't go my way I'm going to kill you what but why you won't kill that man in the mirror why do that man in the mirror get to Live While that man in the mirror commit murder why did that man think that his back was so out of sorts that he could be alive with his bad back while he killed his man with his non-disability and you killing this healthcare insurance man because he's a healthcare CEO what but I thought you were so smart. And come to find out Luigi magaloni is dumb as a bag of rocks. That mean all that money his parents spent for him to go to school and finish top of his class he went and ruined the name of that family and the richness of that family for everybody's going to know them as the son that was the murderer of that CEO that's what they going to look at their name like so he didn't only hurt the family in which he took a life from but he heard the family that he didn't take a life from but he ruined the life of and that's his own family and still got them wasting money cuz now they got to spend money for the lawyer that he incriminated and set this up for himself and let him pay for his own lawyer just cuz somebody holds the title in your life don't mean you have to uphold them with that title not if they don't keep it and earn it righteously. And the way some of these kids want to go to court and and sign a right away and in this Enchanted cells with their parents and change their name where the parents need to feel the same way when they kids discuss their name like that and must they named up cuz he going to be able to keep that name in the Bible the family I shall put my businesses in a brand new name I don't know can see that messed that one up and with that kind of energy on your business that you have right now he's ruining it and the depreciation has begun play and so all this talk about some insurance lack of and denial of insurance that's a lie that dude was walking around with a full loaded backpack on his back thought you had a back problem seems like you don't, then this man also walks around and act like an innocent bystander and he stands in the subway with his man don't have no clue of who he is even when he walked by him he ain't stopped and look at him and say so cuz he wasn't hiding to him he could see his face if you walk by him like he did he didn't even know this guy never seen him before. So for this guy to write such rhetoric letters about nothing and it don't make sense at all it's a bunch of loud talking since we talked cuz it seems like Brian Thompson knows nothing about losing macaroni he don't even know him never seen him the way that man walk past this dude in the subway he never seen her cuz I'm sure by just common decency he want to say hey how's it going he would have said something had he recognized them to know him know him but it seems like he didn't identify with this guy at all to be that close to him and walk right brushed past them ain't nobody was in the subway enough where here it is he had open space and access to shoot this man in his back like the coward that he is hear if I was his parents I wouldn't be paying for that lawyer I don't care if he my son or not you stop being my son when you stop being my son cuz ain't no way in the world no mother or father want a child to commit to murder and still want me to be their parents no I will not you are going to be by yourself with that one. Cuz you was by yourself when you killed that man and your mother and father wasn't standing there when you shot that man in the back so you don't need them now for real",0,2024-12-12T09:25:14Z,2024-12-12T09:38:24Z

@johnskelton5683,"I have little to no sympathy for United Healthcare's CEO. Examine his hire date and denial of service by United Healthcare at that time! This CEO in the short span as CEO with United Healthcare greatly increased the denial of service claims during his tenure as CEO, why? I'll tell you why, because he and others were doing 'pump and dump' with the stocks he as CEO owned in United Healthcare. Understand that even the stockholders had no knowledge he was doing this. This CEO is another well trained financial criminal. Don't believe me, then ask Congress, U.S. Congress who were alarmed with the outrageous denial of service claims since this man became CEO. Ask the United States Department Of Justice who was investigating the practices of United Healthcare. It's quite simple. United Healthcare hires this criminal CEO, he then porpoisely increases the denial of service claims increasing corporate profits, this by allowing policy holders to suffer and or die while his stock holdings in the company rose dramatically then selling that stock at a great profit. Examine his wealth when hired then at his death! This CEO along with other corporate criminals at United Healthcare were in the 'pump and dump' game using human lives to achieve wealth for themselves! 😮",2,2024-12-11T20:18:32Z,2024-12-11T20:18:32Z

@JohnDurkin-ws8vv,"I have United healthcare and I am diabetic.When I started this plan I needed to get prior authorization for all of my medications.They continuously denied my my prescription for a continuous glucose monitor, something that has improved my health and well being tremendously.  I spent 4 months and recorded 21 calls with united healthcare to figure out why they were denying this medication. The reasons they gave me for denying this prescription ranged from improperly filling out paperwork to ""we are not sure that you have type 1 diabetes"" . There was no continuity in there responses, I could spend a day calling them and get 4 different reasons for why they denied the prescription. After all of this when I finally got the approval, the cost was 210 dollars, it cost 280 dollars at Costco without insurance. I have already stopped buying insulin needles through insurance because they want to charge me 45 dollars for a box that I can buy on amazon for 20. Me and my employer pay thousands of dollars a year to a company that promises to collectively bargain on my behalf to protect me from being overcharged in healthcare, they are actively doing the opposite because it is in their bottom lines best interest.  I understand that my condition is expensive, but that is just being used as an excuse to rip off millions of Americans that have no choice but to pay these inflated prices.Private healthcare is ripping off you, your employer, and the american taxpayers.

@kellykonecny7705,"I have an opinion today that probably won’t be popular, but for 4 years I have dealt with a multitude of problems that began with a greedy “Inhumane Employer” (who hasn’t gotten better with time), then a workers Compensation Insurance Company who don’t give a shit how you feel, how you pay your bills or how you survive.
Then the nightmare of Social Security for nearly 2 years because they are waiting for you to commit suicide before you win your case!
I’m not an advocate of shooting someone in the back to draw attention to a universal problem, but I can see how it escalated to that!

First of all, NOBODY who sits back behind a desk all day denying people the medical care they are entitled to should be making 10 Million dollars a year and have the nerve to smile for a Corporate photo! They should be ashamed!!!

However, let me just sum up the status of a life I can no longer fully enjoy due to decisions made by people who lost NOTHING while I lost EVERYTHING!
Even my identity!!!!

So, Auburn Nursing and Rehabilitation Center and their lack of moral responsibility in making sure that their staff to patient ratio is safe!!!
*THEY ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY WORK INJURY, MY FINANCIAL DECLINE AND THE MENTAL BREAKDOWN THAT COMES WITH BEING INJURED & UNEXPECTEDLY UNEMPLOYED!!!*
I never received an apology for the lack of staffing, I was insulted for having gotten injured in the first place!

Then, while you are dealing with the dumpster fire of what your life has become overnight………..
Now you get to deal with a Compensation Insurance Company who fight you at every turn and send you your meager payments every 2 or 3 weeks. Whatever is convenient for them!
Now come the denials…… My left foot was Semi- numb all the time and would unexpectedly go completely numb several times a day.
The doctor told me in November that I needed surgery, which the Insurance Company refused to pay for until we had a Court Date in January to which, nobody from the company attended!!!
I had my surgery in February. My injury was October 1st.

Up until the injury, I was fully functional and had a happy, active life!

I had the surgery, 13 months of recovery and I’m left with a 20 pound weight limit and require the ability to take frequent rest periods throughout the day.
Might be possible for a CEO with a comfy chair and his feet on his desk, but as a nurse…………you’ve been put out to pasture!
Financially, things can only get worse.
Personally, by the time you have been “laid-up” for that long and you only leave the house for doctors appointments, your social life is dead and buried.
You can’t afford to live alone anymore, so you lose your apartment.
Your relationships with family and friends suffer because it’s been so long.
I personally had been a nurse for 38 years at the time. That was my identity. So, I lost that too.

Okay, I hope you get the point here, because I’m done with this nightmare trip down memory lane………

Like I said, I don’t believe it’s right to shoot someone in the back, but I definitely understand the desire to show the people that hold the cards of your life after an injury how it feels to lose EVERYTHING you have worked for your entire life because of decisions THEY made on your behalf.
From the CEO of your employer who set you up to get injured, to the CEO of the Tri-Star Compensation Insurance Company who denies you surgery for 5 months, then the HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY who fight you for 2 years before they agree to pay you back a dime of money that you have been paying into the system since you were 18 or before!

I’m gonna leave it here. I’ve provided you with 2 images.

One, a lifelong nurse trying to do her job to the best of her ability without the staff or the supplies to make it safe.
Being too old to start over, but young enough to enjoy her life if her employer had not set her up to get hurt. Never being able to get back to the comfortable way of life that she earned for herself.

The other, the CEO’s of companies making upwards of $10 Million dollars a year and is afforded BONUSES for denying as many claims as possible so that the company and its employees can bring home big fat paychecks!

I’d dare to say that the meeting in N.Y. City could possibly have been an end of the year celebration in a hotel with more food than they could possibly need for the people that spend their days denying proper care to people who are entitled to it to pad the bottom line of the company!

I don’t know what this victim did personally, but I guarantee it was many of the things I mentioned!

Moral of the story……………………STOP LINING YOUR POCKETS, DRIVING FANCY CARS, LIVING IN MULTI MILLION DOLLAR HOMES AT THE EXPENSE OF INJURED OR SICK PEOPLE!!!!!",0,2024-12-11T18:38:34Z,2024-12-11T18:38:34Z

@jonathanthomaz6023,"“To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.”

It’s the govts fault for not paying their bills to all the healthcare providers, what do you expect.

@koolertrek,"I say all this hoping you will see the light and the truth. I didn't know the Truth for 50 years of my life until the Lord came to me on a hike, and I was drastically changed. Also, I understand that what I will say can be difficult to accept. You know the world has a different idea of truth, but Jesus, the Son of God, is the truth. What comes from Him is truth, and one day, it will be all that matters. I’m not sure if you know, but sins are acts against God, the Father of Jesus Christ. This God is your Creator. There are degrees of sin, with the killing of another human being as one of the worst. Just like you probably wouldn’t want to participate in the killing of innocent puppies in their mother’s womb, the killing of an unborn human is much worse. There are consequences for this sin that might not be obvious at first. In fact, you don't even have to believe in Jesus Christ to be affected by sins against God. One day, you will take your last breath. You will not have a choice about this, and you will be face to face with Jesus Christ, the Judge of every human being who has ever lived. You will have to answer for your sins. I strongly encourage you not to vote for a lady who seems to delight and have a passion for abortions. This is not good for you and certainly not good for this country.",0,2024-12-11T17:42:46Z,2024-12-11T17:42:46Z

@zafarmian427,"Due to my personal experience and firsthand knowledge, I fully agree that United Healthcare's only goal is to make huge unfair profits at the expense of health, wealth and welfare of millions of helpless poor patients who are systematically exploited. It is also patronized by AARP who falsely claims to be on consumers side though it is so misleading. My wife and I switched to another drug plan, picked from the list of Medicare, after receiving unjustified increase notice for 2024 and have saved a few thousand dollars until now this year. We also wish to get out of United Healthcare's AARP Medicare supplementary Plan asap because the monthly premium is regularly increased every six months for not any known reason.🤔",0,2024-12-11T17:36:15Z,2024-12-11T17:36:15Z

Allopathy is a business setup based on “maximise the profit”. All aspects of it, hospitals, doctors, drugstores, drug makers, insurances….
Many ways they do it.
1. Promote unhealthy food.
2. ⁠Promote unhealthy lifestyle
3. ⁠Create and spread viruses like Covid, hiv, etc
4. ⁠Promote vaccines, drugs etc and hide side effects
5. ⁠Treat side effects by feeding more drugs
6. ⁠Ration any treatment
7. ⁠Deny, Delay and Depose claims
8. ⁠Treat even if you are not sick (but with deep pockets or good coverage)
9. ⁠Steal your organs
10. ⁠Delay your last breath (if you or relatives have deep pockets)
11. ⁠Make you believe “ your health is safe in our hands”.
12. ⁠Find and name new diseases for newly developed drugs
13. ⁠No cure provided, only treatments, most are lifelong.
14. ⁠A cured patient is a lost customer, so is a dead one.
15. ⁠Catch those “patient customers young” for maximum profit.

People in The UK need to stand firm against the powerfull corporations tirelessly aiming at our National Health Care System. There is already a consistant effort in selling health insurance to The UK citizens through massive advertisement campain articulated around demonising The NHS, blaming its lengthy waiting times coupled with deceptive offers of so called generous and attractive low up front cost of insurance premiums. It also appears that these corporations have a deep penetration in NHS and The UK government apparatus with the hired guns of a plethora of extraordinary active lobbying businesses entrenched and clustered around The United Kingdom Parliament in London with strong pannels of sold out experts and a deep reach in decision making quarters. Only rich people are likely to have the motive to gain from privatisation of The NHS. Nothing substantial is there for poor to gain from NHS's privatisation. These sad stories about a controversial health care system in The United States are a wake up call for the UK public and policy makers particularly representatives in Westminster and devolved parliaments and of course the bureaucracy who appear to ignore the growth of the private health insurance businesses by failing to come up with meaningful legislation to curb the rise of private health insurance business in this beautiful Kingdom.",0,2024-12-11T16:20:47Z,2024-12-11T16:20:47Z

@batie83,"Unrestrained corporate greed presents a considerable threat to America's long-term economic competitiveness. I believe this unchecked greed almost ensures that China will emerge victorious in the struggle for global supremacy. Unlike the American model, where profit maximisation often prioritises short-term gains over long-term sustainability, Chinese companies tend to focus on long-term growth, efficient production, and competitive pricing. This approach allows them to develop high-quality products at competitive costs.

Americans are deluding themselves if they believe that tariffs will give them a competitive advantage. Unless they address cancer of corporate greed,  China will likely prevail.",0,2024-12-11T09:14:09Z,2024-12-11T09:14:09Z

Healthcare should be affordable for everyone since it’s the most basic human rights, and even without insurance, the price should still be reasonable and affordable. The only reason to pay for insurance is to derisk potential long-term disease and by doing so should be cheaper in the long run.

@vadimant7872,"Dialogue Between Harley Quinn and Marla Singer: Martini, Inflation, and the End of Illusions

Scene: A semi-destroyed café overlooking a dystopian metropolis. Harley sits on the bar counter, twirling a martini glass filled with cheap bourbon. Marla Singer smokes, leaning against a rusty cigarette vending machine.

Harley: The global economy, Marla, is like a martini glass. You know why? The stem is all the cheap workers slaving away for peanuts while we’re sitting here chatting. And on top? The fat “golden billion” guzzling it all down. Balanced? Pfft, only at first glance.

Marla: (smirking) Oh, sure. Except the stem’s been cracked for a while now. Those workers don’t want to hold up that damn glass anymore. And all that “cream” on top? They’re just pouring from one empty glass into another. The golden billion? More like the “moldy billion” by now.

Harley: Ha! And what about dollars? Those Wall Street guys in suits are just like, “Let’s print more green paper and make the whole world pay for our inflation!” Genius, right?

Marla: Genius, like screwing over the whole world for cheap burgers and useless subscriptions to another streaming service. You know what’s funniest? These IT and financial companies… They don’t even have real value. Just middlemen. Redistributors.

Harley: (laughs) Yeah, like parasites sucking the blood. Kind of like you with those guys at your “anonymous addicts” meetings.

Marla: At least I’m honest about it. But look at these zoomers—just walking tragicomedies. They grew up on endless likes and filters, and now they can’t tell reality from an algorithm. Like Carlin said, “Everyone’s just floating along while the ship sinks.”

Harley: (mock sympathy) Poor babies. They’ve never had to make real decisions. No euthanasia, no desperate leaps into the void. All for the sake of their “safety.” And the old folks, oh, they’re clinging to power with a death grip while machines keep them fed.

Marla: (sarcastically) Euthanasia’s taboo for them. Personally, I think it’s time to start a “Purge.” But instead of killing, there’d just be a little button: “Turn off life.” Cost-effective and humane.

Both laugh. Harley takes a sip from her glass.

Harley: Did you hear the news? Some guy in Pennsylvania offed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.

Marla: (mocking) A murder at McDonald’s. The irony is, that “hero” just took the lid off one can of worms. These guys can’t even die dramatically.

Harley: Oh, come on, it’s symbolic. Killing the people who sold your life for an insurance plan? That’s almost revolutionary.

Marla: Except instead of Bane from The Dark Knight, we get a pathetic Luigi with a cheeseburger in one hand and a gun in the other.

Harley: (dreamily) But imagine if Bane did show up… Picture it: the mask, the voice, the reckoning. No one spared. The nouveau riche, their kids, their tiny dogs—everyone gets what’s coming. Now that would be beautiful.

Marla: (winking) Only if he starts with the IT corporations and crypto-gurus. They’ve been leeching off everyone for far too long.

Harley: (smiling) Oh yeah. A world without them would be gray, but honest.

In the background, the sound of sirens echoes. The two women exchange smiles. The spiral of global hyperinflation has already begun, and they’re ready to watch as the martini glass shatters into pieces.",0,2024-12-11T06:29:41Z,2024-12-11T06:29:41Z

@lokiva8540,"This shooting may not be a murder, if all the facts are considered, and regardless of in some respects fitting a literal definition of the alleged crime.  

Consider the twisted ways in which governments talk about collateral damage from legitimate objective targeting.  Then consider how corrupt politicians (including judges and such) are in effect similar legal virtual fictions as CEO's, acting in official capacities and not as actual born humans.  
.
Medscape, a professional info service with adjunct news feeds and forums, requiring a verified US or Canadian medical license or closely allied professional status, said this:    

""Many physicians reacted with the opposite of sympathy to the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson this week, reflecting pent-up frustration and anger over what they described as the health insurer’s routine denials of care for sick or dying patients.""  

Medscape used the term ""slain"", and not ""murdered"" as maintrream media did, in other parts of its reporting.  They didn't go so far as to suggest much deserved schadenfreude.  

I agree that slain is fitting, and that a reasonable jury could find there was a justifiable homicide, but no murder.  That relates to a pervasive lawfare hypocrisy and schizoid political constructs over official versus natural born persons, in Constitutional law, RTKBA, and SCOTUS scams over qualified or absolute immunity.  Some of that lawfare is at odds with the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (enactment of the 14th Amendment, ratified 1868, as a Jeffersonian model delayed; see Alexander Reinert's research in CA Law Rev last year), which was falsely recorded in 1874 and FDR era both.  

An ""official person"", a legal virtual fiction, was slain. The nature of lawfare to confuse that with natural persons who may be coincident, is an illness and perversion of lawyering all the way up into SCOTUS.  

The notion of having ""empathy"" for virtual legal fictions is insane, noting the guy slain was behind ordering UHC to impose AI's to auto-deny many valid medical claims.  His death, despite taking out a coincident baby hatcher, purely involved that official legal fiction with a massive abuse history, in forms any sane potential co-parent might better boycott rather than try to share profits from predatory corporate scams on real people as medical customers.  

It may even be sociopathic or worse, to feign empathy for perverse lawfare fictions.

The fear of many officials could reflect how if crooked CEO's who don't get prosecuted by government see more citizen law enforcement, there's very little difference between that and taking the same approach to crooks in government, rather than pretend they can mix and match civil rights and due process claims as citizens, with immunity claims as legal fictions.  

Except, RTKBA applies more directly to ""domestic enemies"" corrupting government duties from within.  And, that, whether on SCOTUS, in Congress, 3 letter agencies, etc.  The securities industry, and paid election tampering systems, might also be considered.  

The existing judicial cherry picking of disparate standards, that by law require a rational, fact based analysis, is a mess overdue for major change. 

On top of all those issues, our society may also be overdue to grow up in how we recognize violent crime.  Financial fraud that denies medical care or access to food and housing, in urban industrial society based on mega-corps and economic systems rather than farming or hunting oneself as in historic times, amounts to core survival needs.  No matter how many crooked politicians say otherwise (while massively funding military crimes against humanity), financial crimes that cripple people's capacity to live, have become a more prolific form of effective violence, than direct physical violations.",2,2024-12-11T03:03:02Z,2024-12-11T03:03:02Z

Yes the rage that got him killed was justified but the action was not justifiable. These kinds of nuances should be communicated or more rage will be justifiable and more unjustifiable actions may happen because of it from the people that have the CEO’s families back. Maybe not though? Maybe they will play within the rules, probably so and find a way to stick it to you legally. I bet you all the money in the world it didn’t make the ceo happy one time when service was denied but it’s the nature of the beast and someone has to lead the company, I bet he tried everyday to find a way to cover as many people as possible and stay profitable. I bet he saw the opportunity to try and do as much good as possible from within the system. He was a person. How messed up to insinuate that he had it coming.

@jryecart8017,"Build Back Better’s Welfare for the Wealthy Formed Foundation of Inflation Reduction Act
November 19, 2024
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Democrats, unsatisfied with sparking an inflation crisis with their $2 trillion so-called stimulus in March 2021, pushed to go even further with the Build Back Better Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives three years ago today, and became the basis for the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The result is hundreds of billions of tax dollars in special interest tax breaks for the wealthy, big banks, billion-dollar corporations, and foreign adversaries like China.

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) issued the following statement on the anniversary:

“While working families have experienced a 20 percent loss in their incomes due to Bidenflation, the wealthy, big banks, billion-dollar companies, and the Chinese Communist Party have reaped the benefits of Democrats’ beloved taxpayer subsidies. From a $7,500 tax break for the wealthy to buy a luxury electric vehicle, to financing Wall Street’s green obsession, to providing Obamacare subsidies for households making up to $600,000, Democrats have left working families behind by pushing policies where over 90 percent of the tax breaks go to companies that make over a $1 billion in sales every single year – but scraps for small businesses. 

“Democrats were prepared to move forward with a $7 trillion tax hike on working families and small businesses, until President Trump interrupted their plans. As he returns to the White House, Republicans in the House are already working to undo the harm Democrats have caused and advance policies that support working families and small businesses.”

@c.rutherford,"Q:  What is Single Payer?

In America there is a payer in the middle called for-profit health insurance.  
You pay them premiums.   They then keep as much of the money as possible... and then use the rest to pay for your healthcare after they research every possible way to deny your claims.  All of the money they collect and don't spend on your healthcare, is their reward as profit.
That is called a double payer system.
With Single Payer, which the rest of the civilized world has, you pay taxes into a kitty, and ALL of this money is used to pay for healthcare.  Healthcare is guaranteed by law and no claims are denied.
It works a lot like Medicare and Social Security.
Note:  This is NOT socialized medicine.  The practice of medicine and doctors are still private.  It is only the health insurance that is government backed.

@georgechyz,"The renowned psychologist Kevin Dutton made a top 10 list of the types of jobs that attract the most psychopaths: 
1 CEO (Chief Operating Officer) 
2 Lawyer 
3 TV or radio personality 
4 Sales 
5 Surgeon 
6 Journalist 
7 Police officer 
8 Clergy 
9 Chef 
10 Civil servant 

As you can see, CEO is the most popular profession for psychopaths. By the way, most members of congress and all judges are trained as lawyers. Therefore, the USA is mostly run by psychopaths. 

When Gardiner Morse was senior editor at Harvard Business Review he wrote a 2004 article entitled “Executive Psychopaths”. Here’s an excerpt:

“Chances are good there’s a psychopath on your management team. Seriously. I’m not talking about the “psycho” boss that employees like to carp about—the hard-driving supervisor who sometimes loses it. He’s just difficult. Nor am I referring to the sort of homicidal “psychopath” Hollywood likes to serve up—Freddy Krueger, say, or Brando’s Colonel Kurtz. Neither is, clinically speaking, a psychopath. 

""I’m talking about the real thing, the roughly 1% of the population that is certifiably psychopathic. True psychopaths are diagnosed according to very specific clinical criteria, and they’re nothing like the popular conception. What stands out about bona fide psychopaths is that they’re so hard to spot. They’re chameleons. They have a cunning ability to act perfectly normal and indeed to be utterly charming, as they wreak havoc on the lives of the people around them and the companies they inhabit. 

""Many of psychopaths’ defining characteristics—their polish, charm, cool decisiveness, and fondness for the fast lane—are easily, and often, mistaken for leadership qualities. That’s why they may be singled out for promotion. But along with their charisma come the traits that make psychopaths so destructive: They’re cunning, manipulative, untrustworthy, unethical, parasitic, and utterly remorseless. There’s nothing they won’t do, and no one they won’t exploit, to get what they want. A psychopathic manager with his eye on a colleague’s job, for instance, will doctor financial results, plant rumors, turn coworkers against each other, and shift his persona, as needed, to destroy his target. He’ll do it, and his bosses will never know.” 

The old saying that power corrupts is wrong, in reality corrupted people labeled psychopaths seek power and their unbridled ruthlessness insures that they find a way to obtain power. Certainly free market capitalism helps psychopaths by freeing them to behave ruthlessly as they climb toward the top of the capitalistic pyramid of power.

This important issue needs to be taken more seriously. I think it's the key to understanding why peace and prosperity has never developed globally. Psychopaths keep pushing for more and more power as they reach for full spectrum global dominance.

It seems to me that the only way out of this mess is direct democracy where every adult votes on all major decisions at all levels, in businesses, in villages, in counties, in cities, in states, and at the federal level. With that system everyone has equal power and the psychopaths are only 1%. Direct democracy works well in Switzerland.

@asabovesobelow5683,I have Medicare part A and B and there is no way I would change it to an Advantage plane even if they offered me money on a card for food and bills each month. There is nothing free and to change insurance to the advatage plan is just footing the medical bills back to yourself with little to no coverage and pre authorized care for almost everything. We recently got a bill from the insurance from when my daughter went to the er and the insurance company said that they at the hospital performed a procedure that wasnt  necessary and they would not cover it. What kind of bs is that like we have a say on the tests the er does. Your not informed nor are you even aware of what is wrong with the person and what tests they need or dont need to find out the problem. In no way should the ceo been killed violence is not the answer nor is puting people in poverty or dening care to people that need it for what ever reason profit should not come before the lives of anyone and to deny care to someone that needs it for any reason is wrong.,0,2024-12-10T20:40:09Z,2024-12-10T20:44:58Z

@susanhuy2819,"Look..the problem is not this particular CEO, or even corporation, because everyone in the healthcare insurance industry is culpable to some degree.

What we need to do IMO are three things and they need to happen simultaneously, consistently and relentlessly ( no letting our eyeballs and actions be distracted the next time any politician or ANY media outlet throws out the next shiny object).

1) massive vigils in every medium sized city and larger..held at least twice weekly to guarantee a high number of participants..held no longer than two hours for same reason.

2)massive letter, email, call campaign to every political animal letting them know that if they don't support universal non- profit healthcare, it won't be worth their while even thinking about campaigning.

3) massive call for employers/ institutions to divest from any mutual funds that deal with the private health insurance industry. UH has already taken a massive hit..it needs to be industry- wide!

Now whether ""the home of the brave"" actually have the stomach and the fortitude to carry this out?

@daydays12,"I am a Brit living in France where healthcare is excellent.
Routine medical treatment and tests are partially paid for by the government, but the patient is responsible for the remaining amount. French state health insurance covers 70–100% of necessary treatments like doctor visits and hospital stays, Xrays, scans, MRM scans etc 
Serious diseases and conditions are treated for free.
I am a good example ...I was eleven days in intensive care and  four weeks in hospital. I paid nothing I had a TKR I paid very little.  My detached retina was brilliantly sewn back on and I paid nothing.
I get a dentist, doctor, appointment when I want

@cliff32cr,"""Note how the media is downplaying Brian Thompson's ten million-dollar-a-year salary.""

12/09/2024:  Response by Political Analyst and Strait Shooter;  Cliff Strait

Telling you what Mainstream Media, their commentators, and their pundits will not tell you.

I don't condone what Luigi Mangioni, the killer of Brian Thompson did, but he has shone a dim light on the outlandish profits and salaries these health insurance executives pay themselves through price gauging and using claims as a profit center at the expense of the patients.

This is what happens when governments and their oversight agencies fail to act.  So, society becomes childlike without the words to express themselves, so they resort to acting out physically and violently.

Note how the media is downplaying Brian Thompson's ten million-dollar-a-year salary. You know he is not the only one in their company being paid this kind of outlandish salary at the expense of quality healthcare at a reasonable cost to consumers.

This lack of reporting is a slap in the face of all Americans.

The media should be investigating this more and exposing the impact of corporate lobbyists and corporate money being used to corrupt our congress, the courts, our elections, and the corporate abuse, especially when it comes to healthcare, pharmaceutical drugs, food, gas, oil and so much more.

We should also include industries such as phone companies, cell phone companies, internet service, utility companies, and more.  Even some city governments sell utilities, garbage pickup, and water sewage.

Corporate America has total control over inflation. Unfortunately, we live in a laissez-faire capitalist society and Corporate America controls inflation with their price gauging aided by Republican support to receive their PAC donations to stay in office for life.  They can arbitrarily increase the cost of goods and services or they can lower the cost of goods and services.  

Inflation is artificially driven up by Wall Street's meet or beat their expectations, forcing corporations to increase their prices to pay more to their executives,  shareholders, and stockholders who are doing nothing more than gambling (speculating).  Wall Street provides no benefit to the economy other than being a parasite.",1,2024-12-10T18:34:49Z,2024-12-10T18:42:06Z

@davidladuke7039,"""I couldn't in good conscience support"" the health insurance industry is another way of saying ""people of good conscience can't work in the insurance industry."" They pretend they're making a-moral cost-benefit judgments but there's no such thing when it comes to comparing profits to people. Every judgement is moral in that case. And to pretend otherwise is to behave IMMORALLY. Health insurance is a grift we can all see but are required to engage with. It's inherently degrading and dehumanizing.

We remember when you send off poor people to die in foreign lands so that your stocks will go up. We remember when you deny healthcare to our families.

@briquetaverne,"To Wendell Potter and all the other high brows who find ways to turn deaf ears to the thunderous roar of public demand by asking lamely ""How do we find ways to Harness this rage...""  ? 

  The answer is this: 

1)- cut the red tape, steam roll over the opponents of the 87% of Americans that have been screaming loudly and shaking the rafters to stop treating healthcare as a commodity, and recognize it as a human right! 

2)-  Create a time limit of less than one calendar year to formulate, propose into legislation and execute into existence a single payer healthcare system for all human beings living within our borders that covers every healthcare need;

 3)-  Is administrated properly, efficiently and overseen as well or better than any in other existing 1st world nation's health care system on the globe.

4)- Next, to recognize publicly that Healthcare Insurance corporations in America have transformed into licensed, white collar ""Execution Squads"" who arbitrarily choose life or death based on their profit margins. And... 

5)- lastly, That since the SCOTUS has determined that corporations are ""people"" by following in this line, the prosecutors of each state should begin investigations on ""who"" within these organizations were denying claims based on the profits they'd lose if they didn't and which ultimately led to deaths of clients.",1,2024-12-10T17:54:26Z,2024-12-10T18:21:35Z

@Patricwithnok,"Last year my partner asked for an MRI for severe back pain. Insurance refused to pay for it until he completed 8 weeks of physical therapy. He had been in and out of PT for 2 years at that point. Nevertheless, we acquiesced and spent several hundred dollars on PT. Then on New Years after the 8 weeks were up, he bent over and suddenly couldn’t move. We rushed to the ER and were in the waiting room for 8 hours before we were seen on a gurney in the hallway. They told us they couldn’t do any imaging other than an ultrasound which showed nothing but arthritis which we already knew about. They have him a steroid injection and opioids and muscle relaxers. In the next two days, these didn’t touch the pain and he couldn’t stand up straight. We are very young so it was terrifying. Finally, we drove over to the imaging center and then insurance DENIED us an MRI again even though we followed their guidance. We ended up paying out of pocket nearly a thousand dollars for this. Two discs herniated and he ended up with lower lumbar stenosis. Only now have they finally, after a year of pressure, we are getting reimbursed for the MRI but I don’t think that’s enough. Fuck healthcare in this country. I don’t feel bad in the slightest. They profit off of our misery and they get what they deserve.

@innconspicuous,Funny story got off the phone with United healthcare after 56 minutes of back and forth this morning with none of the information I requested and no appeals decision made. What am I appealing? Two denials due to referral issues to see the same doctor I've been seeing for 2 years. I paid $400 cash the 1st for my United healthcare policy I'm at my doctor's with a completely failed artery stent a few days later paying $300 out of pocket because they're threatening to reschedule because United healthcare sucks... I call them same day to get the referral backdated and they're telling me I never did it and I'm trying to send them the fax receipt and they're not accepting it they won't even tell me the fax number to send it to.... I did my part I sent the records... Not to mention the $600 CT to confirm that my artery was completely closed that I paid out of pocket because their nurse was supposed to review it in 3 days it had been 11 days I called about that too and I couldn't wait any longer.... And you got people in this comment section boohooing so tone deaf as to what the anger actually is. Where is this resentment coming from I don't know maybe you shouldn't be so out of touch with reality you don't understand what's going on around you.,0,2024-12-10T17:36:35Z,2024-12-10T17:36:35Z

@Whatdahwhere,It’s possible that when you have had a leadership that resorts to violence when it doesn’t get its way it sets a poor example for its citizens and may result in these types of actions. Note: I am in no way condoning the actions of the perpetrator. I’m only suggesting a possible reason of why.,3,2024-12-10T16:46:40Z,2024-12-10T16:46:40Z
